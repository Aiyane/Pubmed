In this review, the potential for use of soy-derived bioactive compounds as
immunomodulatory feed additives in pigs is discussed. Soy is a major component of
the modern U.S. swine diet in today's commercial industry, providing the bulk of 
dietary AA necessary for growth and production. However, soy use has generally
been limited in early growth phases, during which the risks of immunological
insult and disease are among the highest. Improvements of soybean processing and 
development of soy protein products with little to no antinutritional factors
have made soy more appropriate for use in young pigs but additional processing
may impact bioactive compound levels in the feed. The bioactive compounds of
interest for this review are soy isoflavones and soy saponins. Soy isoflavones
are flavonoid compounds with a range of biological activity including moderate
estrogenic effects at low biological concentrations. While estrogenic effects are
of more interest in human medical research, isoflavones are also known for their 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidative properties at cellular levels, engaging several 
receptors and pathways including inhibition of NF-κB activation and
inducible-nitric oxide synthase enzymes; thereby, ascribing anti-viral
properties. Saponins, amphipathic glycoside compounds, also engage
anti-inflammatory pathways, though their biological activity in pigs has not been
well investigated and seem to mainly be observed on the mucous membrane in the
gastrointestinal tract. Regarding use as an immunomodulatory feed additive,
supplemental soy isoflavones have been shown to improve immunological status of
pigs and produce mild improvements of growth performance under certain disease
challenges including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).
While more in vivo research in pigs is needed to fully understand biological
activity of these compounds in the live animal, soy-derived bioactive compounds
show great potential as a health promoting feed additive for the modern swine
industry.

Phytohormones are central to the plant growth and development. Despite the
advancement in our knowledge of hormone signaling, downstream targets and their
interactions upon hormones action remain largely fragmented, especially at the
protein and metabolite levels. With an aim to get new insight into the effects of
two hormones, ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA), this study utilizes an
integrated proteomics and metabolomics approach to investigate their individual
and combined (ABA+ET) signaling in soybean leaves. Targeting low-abundance
proteins, our previously established protamine sulfate precipitation method was
applied, followed by label-free quantification of identified proteins. A total of
4129 unique protein groups including 1083 differentially modulated in one
(individual) or other (combined) treatments were discerned. Functional annotation
of the identified proteins showed an increased abundance of proteins related to
the flavonoid and isoflavonoids biosynthesis and MAPK-signaling pathway in
response to ET treatment. HPLC analysis showed an accumulation of isoflavones
(genistin, daidzein, and genistein) upon ET treatment, in agreement with the
proteomics results. A metabolome analysis assigned 79 metabolites and further
confirmed the accumulation of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in response to ET. A
potential cross-talk between ET and MAPK-signaling, leading to the accumulation
of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in soybean leaves is suggested. This article is

In this study, the effects of UV-B radiation on the isoflavones accumulation,
physiological and nutritional quality, water status, and characteristics of
proteins in germinated soybeans were investigated. The results showed that
isoflavones content in soybeans increased with appropriate intensity and time of 
UV-B radiation and decreased with excessive treatment. Fresh weight, length, free
amino acids, reducing sugar contents and bulk water (T23) in germinated soybeans 
decreased with increasing radiation time, indicating that UV-B inhibited the
growth and nutrients metabolism of soybean during germination. Cell damage was
detected in germinated soybeans with excessive UV-B radiation, as shown by the
black spots in cotyledons and the increased intercellular water determined by
LF-NMR. Germination resulted in an increase in random coil structures, while UV-B
radiation induced no obvious changes in FT-IR spectrum and protein conformation
of soybeans. Both UV-B radiation and germination caused the increase in soluble
proteins, especially in 1.0-75.0 kDa fraction.

This work was the first to investigate on the simultaneous characterization of
metabolite profiles in soybean using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Twenty two
compositions were observed within 14&nbsp;min from the methanol extract and confirmed 
as twelve isoflavones of three types and ten soyasaponins (Ab, Af, I-III, αg, βg,
βa, γg, and γa). Moreover, the patterns of two chemicals showed considerable
differences in seven solvent systems by HPLC analysis and their optimal
extraction was achieved by 70% methanol (isoflavone: 4102.69&nbsp;μg/g; soyasaponin:
ten peaks). The second abundant isoflavones were detected in 50% methanol
(4054.39&nbsp;μg/g), followed by 30% methanol, 100% methanol, 10% methanol, CH2Cl2,
and acetone extracts with 3134.03, 2979.49, 1681.33, 366.19, and 119.00&nbsp;μg/g,
respectively. Soyasaponins exhibited similar tendencies as those of isoflavones. 
The highest total phenolic was found as 2.10&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;mg GAE/g in 70% methanol with
remarkable differences by comparing other extracts. Specifically, this extract
showed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory (81%) and antioxidant capacities (DPPH:
93% and ABTS: 95%) at a concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/mL. Our results may be
contributed to enhancing the value to functional foods and evaluating the
secondary metabolites concern to antioxidant properties using solvent system in
soybean.

Adulteration of edible oils has attracted attention from more researchers and
consumers in recent years. Complex multispecies adulteration is a commonly used
strategy to mask the traditional adulteration detection methods. Most of the
researchers were only concerned about single targeted adulterants, however, it
was difficult to identify complex multispecies adulteration or untargeted
adulterants. To detect adulteration of edible oil, identification of
characteristic markers of adulterants was proposed to be an effective method,
which could provide a solution for multispecies adulteration detection. In this
study, a simple method of multispecies adulteration detection for camellia oil
(adulterated with soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) was developed by
quantifying chemical markers including four isoflavones, trans-resveratrol and
sinapic acid, which used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) combined with solid phase extraction (SPE). In commercial camellia
oil, only two of them were detected of daidzin with the average content of 0.06
ng/g while other markers were absent. The developed method was highly sensitive
as the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.02 ng/mL to 0.16 ng/mL and the
mean recoveries ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, indicating that this method was
reliable to detect potential characteristic markers in edible oils. Six target
compounds for pure camellia oils, soybean oils, peanut oils and rapeseed oils had
been analyzed to get the results. The validation results indicated that this
simple and rapid method was successfully employed to determine multispecies
adulteration of camellia oil adulterated with soybean, peanut and rapeseed oils.

This study assessed the effect of whey protein substitution with isolated soy
protein in protein bar (PB) formulations at 25% (PB2), 50% (PB3), or 75% (PB1)
weight/weight on the proximate and mineral composition, sensory, and antidiabetic
properties. Sensory evaluation was conducted within diabetic (DB) and
non-diabetic (NDB) consumers by preference ranking and acceptance test. The
formulations were analysed in terms of moisture, ash, protein, lipid,
carbohydrates, fibers and mineral content. The consumers did not distinguish the 
formulations by preference ranking test. However, the acceptability test showed a
rating of 9 most frequent for PB1 (36.30%), followed by PB2 and PB3 (both
34.09%), among DB consumers. The PB1 and PB3 showed higher content of total,
soluble and insoluble fibers and, PB 2 presented higher carbohydrate content.
Potassium, sodium and calcium showed the highest mineral content in the
formulations. PB3 was assessed for glycaemic and lipidemic control in diabetics
and non-diabetics female Wistar rats, for this 20% of PB was added in the ration 
consumed ad libitum, besides, the rats received 100&nbsp;mg/kg b. w. by gavage daily. 
The treatment did not reduce significantly fasting glucose, lipid profile, or
peripheral glucose disposal in DB or NDB rats. However, it significantly improved
insulin tolerance test values in diabetic rats. The results suggest that the
formulations showed good acceptance and potentially ameliorate insulin resistance
both in control group and in animal model of type II diabetes.
