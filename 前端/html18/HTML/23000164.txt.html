				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MicroRNAs, key posttranscriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression, play important roles in plant development and response to stress. In this study, a soybean <span class="gene">gma-MIR394a</span> gene was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in drought stress resistance. Expression analysis revealed that <span class="gene">gma-MIR394a</span> was expressed differentially in various soybean tissues and was induced by drought, high salinity, low temperature stress, and abscisic acid treatment in leaves. One target gene of gma-miR394a, <span class="gene">Glyma08g11030</span>, was predicted and verified using a modified 5' RLM-RACE (RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends) assay. Overexpression of <span class="gene">gma-MIR394a</span> resulted in plants with lowered leaf water loss and enhanced drought tolerance. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">gma-MIR394a</span> in Arabidopsis reduced the transcript of an F-box gene (At1g27340) containing a miR394 complementary target site. These results suggest that the <span class="gene">gma-MIR394a</span> gene functions in <span class="gene">positive modulation of drought stress tolerance</span> and has potential applications in molecular breeding to enhance drought tolerance in crops.
