				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">MYB-type transcription factors</span> contain the conserved MYB DNA-binding domain of approximately 50 amino acids and are involved in the regulation of many aspects of plant growth, development, metabolism and stress responses. From soybean plants, we identified 156 GmMYB genes using our previously obtained 206 MYB unigenes, and 48 were found to have full-length open-reading frames. Expressions of all these identified genes were examined, and we found that expressions of 43 genes were changed upon treatment with ABA, salt, drought and/or cold stress. Three GmMYB genes, <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span>, <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB177</span>, were chosen for further analysis. Using the yeast assay system, <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> were found to have transactivation activity and can form homodimers. <span class="gene">GmMYB177</span> did not appear to have transactivation activity but can form heterodimers with <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span>. Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that all the three GmMYBs could bind to cis-elements TAT AAC GGT TTT TT and CCG GAA AAA AGG AT, but with different affinity, and <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> could also bind to TCT CAC CTA CC. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span> or <span class="gene">GmMYB177</span> showed better performance than the <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span>-transgenic plants in salt and freezing tolerance. However, these transgenic plants exhibited reduced sensitivity to ABA treatment at germination stage in comparison with the wild-type plants. The three GmMYB genes differentially affected a subset of stress-responsive genes in addition to their regulation of a common subset of stress-responsive genes. These results indicate that the three GmMYB genes may play differential roles in stress tolerance, possibly through regulation of stress-responsive genes.
