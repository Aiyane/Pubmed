						KEY MESSAGE: <span class="gene">Rsc15</span>, a novel locus underlying soybean resistance to SMV, was fine mapped to a 95-kb region on chromosome 6. The <span class="gene">Rsc15</span>- mediated resistance is likely attributed to the gene <span class="gene">GmPEX14</span> , the relative expression of which was highly correlated with the accumulation of H 2 O 2 along with the activities of POD and CAT during the early stages of SMV infection in RN-9. Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) causes severe yield losses and seed quality deterioration in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] worldwide. A series of single dominant SMV resistance genes have been identified on respective soybean chromosomes 2, 13 and 14, while one novel locus, <span class="gene">Rsc15</span>, underlying resistance to the virulent SMV strain SC15 from soybean cultivar RN-9 has been recently mapped to a 14.6-cM region on chromosome 6. However, candidate gene has not yet been identified within this region. In the present study, we aimed to fine map the <span class="gene">Rsc15</span> region and identify candidate gene(s) for this invaluable locus. High-resolution fine-mapping revealed that the <span class="gene">Rsc15</span> gene was located in a 95-kb genomic region which was flanked by the two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers SSR_06_17 and BARCSOYSSR_06_0835. Allelic sequence comparison and expression profile analysis of candidate genes inferred that the gene Glyma.06g182600 (designated as <span class="gene">GmPEX14</span>) was the best candidate gene attributing for the resistance of <span class="gene">Rsc15</span>, and that genes encoding receptor-like kinase (<span class="gene">RLK</span>) (i.e., Glyma.06g175100 and Glyma.06g184400) and serine/threonine kinase (<span class="gene">STK</span>) (i.e., Glyma.06g182900 and Glyma.06g183500) were also potential candidates. High correlations were established between the relative expression level of <span class="gene">GmPEX14</span> and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) during the early stages of SMV-SC15 infection in RN-9. The results of the present study will be useful in marker-assisted breeding for SMV resistance and will lead to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host resistance against SMV.
