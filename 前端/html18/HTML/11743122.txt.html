				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in host defense responses against pathogens in mammals where their activities lead to the production of antimicrobial peptides. We have identified a novel soybean (Glycine max) metalloproteinase gene, <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span>, that is transcriptionally up-regulated in infected tissues. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that this gene belongs to the MMP family. It is a preproprotein containing an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine switch, a zinc-binding catalytic motif, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. The <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli exhibited an in vitro enzymatic activity in digesting myelin basic protein. All plant metalloproteinases reported so far have no known functions. However, they have been suggested to be involved in extracellular cell matrix degradation during development or senescence. Our investigations demonstrate that the <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> transcript levels were rapidly increased in compatible and incompatible interactions of soybean tissues with the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae or the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. In agreement with the <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> activation, a metalloproteinase activity was gradually increased in suspension-cultured cells following the bacterial infection. <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> was also activated in response to wounding and dehydration. However, <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> activation did not correlate with the oxidative burst leading to the hypersensitive response cell death or the tissue senescence progress that involves programmed cell death. Our investigations suggest that <span class="gene">GmMMP2</span> may be involved in a novel defense response of soybean against pathogenic infections.
