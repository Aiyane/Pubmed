				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important crop for oil and protein resources worldwide. The molecular mechanism of the abiotic stress response in soybean is largely unclear. We previously identified multiple stress-responsive WRKY genes from soybean. Here, we further characterized the roles of one of these genes, <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span>, in abiotic stress tolerance using a transgenic hairy root assay. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> expression was increased by various abiotic stresses. Over-expression and RNAi analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> <span class="gene">improves salt and drought tolerance</span> in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Measurement of physiological parameters, including reactive oxygen species and proline contents, supported this conclusion. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> inhibits expression of a downstream gene <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> by binding to the W-boxes in its promoter region. The <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> is a negative factor of stress tolerance as indicated by the performance of transgenic hairy roots under stress. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> interacts with <span class="gene">GmMYB174</span>, which also suppresses <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> expression and enhances drought stress tolerance. The <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB174</span> may have evolved to bind to neighbouring cis elements in the <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> promoter to co-reduce promoter activity and gene expression. Our study discloses a valuable mechanism in soybean for regulation of the stress response by two associated transcription factors. Manipulation of these genes should facilitate improvements in stress tolerance in soybean and other crops.
