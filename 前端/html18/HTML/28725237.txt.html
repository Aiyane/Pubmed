					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytophthora root and stem rot caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae is a destructive disease of soybean worldwide. Plant dirigent proteins (DIR) are proposed to have roles in biosynthesis of either lignan or lignin-like molecules, and are important for defense responses, secondary metabolism, and pathogen resistance. In the present work, a novel DIR gene expressed sequence tag is identified as up-regulated in the highly resistant soybean cultivar 'Suinong 10' inoculated with P. sojae. The full length cDNA is isolated using rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and designated <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> (GenBank accession no. HQ_993047). The full length <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> is 789 bp and contains a 567 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 188 amino acids. The sequence analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> contains a conserved dirigent domain at amino acid residues 43-187. The quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that soybean <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> mRNA is expressed most highly in stems, followed by roots and leaves. The treatments with stresses demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> is significantly induced by P. sojae and gibberellic acid (GA3), and also responds to salicylic acid, methyl jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid. The <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> is targeted to the cytomembrane when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Moreover, The <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> recombinant protein purified from Escherichia coli could effectively direct E-coniferyl alcohol coupling into lignan (+)-pinoresinol. Accordingly, the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> in transgenic soybean increased total lignan accumulation. Moreover, the lignan extracts from <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> transgenic plants effectively inhibits P. sojae hyphal growth. Furthermore, the transgenic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> in the susceptible soybean cultivar 'Dongnong 50' enhances its resistance to P. sojae. Collectively, these data suggested that the primary role of <span class="gene">GmDIR22</span> is probably involved in the regulation of lignan biosynthesis, and which contributes to resistance to P. sojae.
