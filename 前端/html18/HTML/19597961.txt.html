				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transcriptional repressors are emerging as central regulators of development and stress responses in different organisms. The ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif was identified as essential for <span class="gene">transcriptional repression</span>. To gain a better understanding of this type of protein, we reported here a novel <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein from soybean. Sequence alignment showed that <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> contains one AP2/ERF domain, two putative nuclear localization signal regions and one EAR motif. The <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein was preferentially localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells and bound specifically to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> was induced by ethylene, JA, SA, cold, salt, drought, and soybean mosaic virus, and repressed by ABA. Constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> in transgenic tobacco plants <span class="gene">increased <span class="gene">tolerance to salt and drought stresses</span> compared with wild-type plants, but did not exhibit detectable resistance against bacterial infection.
