				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Flowering time, maturity, and plant morphology have considerable effects on the adaptation and grain yield of soybean (Glycine max). The identification of novel genes and an understanding of their molecular basis are critical to improve soybean productivity. In this study, we cloned a flowering time related APETALA2-like gene <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> and generated <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span>-overexpressing lines in the cultivar Williams 82. The transgenic lines exhibited late flowering both under long day and short day conditions, and repressed <span class="gene">the flowering-related genes</span>, including <span class="gene">GmFT2a</span>, <span class="gene">GmFT5a</span>, <span class="gene">GmAP1</span>, and <span class="gene">GmLFY</span>, whereas the flowering repressors <span class="gene">GmFT4</span> and <span class="gene">miR156</span> were upregulated. Interestingly, <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> was also mediated by photoperiod via maturity genes E3 and E4, which encode photoreceptors in soybean. Further, miR172-mediated <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span>, which regulates flowering in soybean, is different in Arabidopsis in that it is dependent on the CONSTANS-like gene GmCOL1a. In addition to its effect on flowering time, <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> regulated plant morphology, increased stem thickness, and reduced plant height, internode length and leaf size, which are important agronomic traits that enhance the capacity to resist lodging and increase soybean yield. This is useful information to understand the molecular mechanism of flowering time and plant morphology in soybean and will greatly influence soybean yield improvement.
