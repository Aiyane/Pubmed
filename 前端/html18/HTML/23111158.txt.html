				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Ethylene-response factors (ERFs) play an important role in regulating gene expression in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a new ERF transcription factor, <span class="gene">GmERF7</span>, was isolated from soybean. Sequence analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> <span class="gene">contained an AP2/ERF domain with 58 amino acids</span>, two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains, an acidic amino acid-rich transcriptional activation domain and a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. The expression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> was induced by drought, salt, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethylene (ETH) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. However, the expression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> decreased under cold treatment. <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> localized to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> protein bound to the GCC-box element in vitro and activated the expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in tobacco leaves. Activities of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> promoter (<span class="gene">GmERF7</span>P) upregulated in tobacco leaves with 10h drought, salt and ETH treatments. However, activities of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span>P decreased with 10h cold and ABA treatments. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> in tobacco plants led to higher levels of chlorophyll and soluble carbohydrates and a lower level of malondialdehyde compared with wild-type tobacco plants under salt stress conditions, which indicated that <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> <span class="gene">enhanced salt tolerance</span> in transgenic plants.
