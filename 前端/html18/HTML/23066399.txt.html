				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seeds of soybean (Glycinemax L.) exposed to 50 mg/L (Cd50), 100 mg/L (Cd100) and 200 mg/L (Cd200) cadmium solution for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h were examined with reference to Cd accumulation, oxidative stress and antioxidative responses. Soybean seeds accumulated Cd in an exposure time-and dosage-dependent manner. FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma) concentration, <span class="gene">GSH</span>/h<span class="gene">GSH</span> content, and <span class="gene">GST</span> activity showed a pronounced exposure time-dependent response. Cd100 enhanced FRAP concentration in germinating soybean seeds as compared to Cd50 treatment after 24 h exposure. Cd200 however increased statistically <span class="gene">GST</span> activities after 72 and 96 h exposure. Under all Cd dosages, <span class="gene">GSH</span>/h<span class="gene">GSH</span> concentrations were depressed with increasing exposure time. Reduction of <span class="gene">GSH</span>/h<span class="gene">GSH</span> content and concomitant increase of <span class="gene">GST</span> activity suggested a possible participation of <span class="gene">GSH</span> into <span class="gene">GSH</span>-Cd conjugates synthesis. MDA content is a potential biomarker for monitoring Cd phytotoxicity because it responds significantly to treatment dosage, exposure time and dosage × exposure time interaction. Increase of proline content may be a response to acute heavy metal toxicity in soybean seeds.
