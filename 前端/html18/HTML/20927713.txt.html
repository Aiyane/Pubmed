				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean genotypes MG/BR46 (Conquista) and BR16, drought-tolerant and -sensitive, respectively, were compared in terms of morphophysiological and gene-expression responses to water stress during two stages of development. Gene-expression analysis showed differential responses in <span class="gene">Gmdreb1a</span> and <span class="gene">Gmpip1b</span> mRNA expression within 30 days of water-deficit initiation in MG/BR46 (Conquista) plants. Within 45 days of initiating stress, <span class="gene">Gmp5cs</span> and <span class="gene">Gmpip1b</span> had relatively higher expression. Initially, BR16 showed increased expression only for <span class="gene">Gmdreb1a</span>, and later (45 days) for <span class="gene">Gmp5cs</span>, Gmdefensin and <span class="gene">Gmpip1b</span>. Only BR16 presented down-regulated expression of genes, such as <span class="gene">Gmp5cs</span> and <span class="gene">Gmpip1b</span>, 30 days after the onset of moisture stress, and Gmgols after 45 days of stress. The faster perception of water stress in MG/BR46 (Conquista) and the better maintenance of up-regulated gene expression than in the sensitive BR16 genotype imply mechanisms by which the former is better adapted to tolerate moisture deficiency.
