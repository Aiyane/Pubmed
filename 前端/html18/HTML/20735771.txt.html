				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In humans, members of the WNK protein kinase family are osmosensitive regulators of cell volume homeostasis and epithelial ion transport, and mutation of these proteins causes a rare inherited form of hypertension due to increased renal NaCl re-absorption. A related class of kinases was recently discovered in plants, but their functions are largely unknown. We have identified a root-specific WNK kinase homolog, <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span>, in soybean (Glycine max). <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> expression was detected in the root, specifically in root cells associated with lateral root formation, and was down-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), as well as by mannitol, sucrose, polyethylene glycol and NaCl. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> interacts with another soybean protein, GmCYP707A1, which is a key ABA 8'-hydroxylase that functions in ABA catabolism. Furthermore, 35S-<span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> transgenic soybean plants had reduced lateral root number and length compared with wild-type, suggesting a role of <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> in the regulation of root system architecture. We propose that <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> functions to fine-tune ABA-dependent ABA homeostasis, thereby mediating the regulation of the root system architecture by ABA and osmotic signals. The study has revealed a new function of a plant WNK1 gene from the important staple crop soybean, and has identified <span class="gene">a new component of a regulatory pathway that is involved not only in ABA signaling</span>, but also in the repression of lateral root formation by an ABA-dependent mechanism distinct from known ABA signaling pathways.
