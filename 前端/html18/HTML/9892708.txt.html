				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The Ca2+ signal is essential for the activation of plant defense responses, but downstream components of the signaling pathway are still poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that specific calmodulin (<span class="gene">CaM</span>) isoforms are activated by infection or pathogen-derived elicitors and participate in Ca2+-mediated induction of plant <span class="gene">disease resistance</span> responses. Soybean <span class="gene">CaM</span> (S<span class="gene">CaM</span>)-4 and S<span class="gene">CaM</span>-5 genes, which encode for divergent <span class="gene">CaM</span> isoforms, were induced within 30 min by a fungal elicitor or pathogen, whereas other S<span class="gene">CaM</span> genes encoding highly conserved <span class="gene">CaM</span> isoforms did not show such response. This pathogen-triggered induction of these genes specifically depended on the increase of intracellular Ca2+ level. Constitutive expression of S<span class="gene">CaM</span>-4 and S<span class="gene">CaM</span>-5 in transgenic tobacco plants triggered spontaneous induction of lesions and induces an array of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-associated genes. Surprisingly, these transgenic plants have normal levels of endogenous salicylic acid (SA). Furthermore, coexpression of nahG gene did not block the induction of SAR-associated genes in these transgenic plants, indicating that SA is not involved in the SAR gene induction mediated by S<span class="gene">CaM</span>-4 or S<span class="gene">CaM</span>-5. The transgenic plants exhibit enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of virulent and avirulent pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and virus. These results suggest that specific <span class="gene">CaM</span> isoforms are components of a SA-independent signal transduction chain leading to <span class="gene">disease resistance</span>.
