				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Take-all (caused by the fungal pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Ggt) and common root rot (caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana) are devastating root diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Development of resistant wheat cultivars has been a challenge since no resistant wheat accession is available. <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span>, one member of polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) family in soybean (Glycine max), exhibited inhibition activity against fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs) in vitro. In this study, the <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span> transgenic wheat plants were generated and used to assess the effectiveness of <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span> in protecting wheat from the infection of Ggt and B. sorokiniana. Four independent transgenic lines were identified by genomic PCR, Southern blot, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The introduced <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span> was integrated into the genomes of these transgenic lines and could be expressed. The expressing <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span> protein in these transgenic wheat lines could inhibit the PGs produced by Ggt and B. sorokiniana. The disease response assessments postinoculation showed that the <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span>-expressing transgenic wheat lines displayed significantly enhanced <span class="gene">resistance to both take-all and common root rot diseases</span> caused by the infection of Ggt and B. sorokiniana. These data suggested that <span class="gene">GmPGIP3</span> is an attractive gene resource in improving <span class="gene">resistance to both take-all and common root rot diseases</span> in wheat.
