						Myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS; EC 5.5.1.4) converts glucose 6-phosphate to myo-inositol 1-phosphate in the presence of NAD(+). It catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of myo-inositol and pinitol, and is a rate limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of inositol in eukaryotes. Therefore, MIPS is involved in biotic and abiotic stress via Ca(2+) signalling. Seedlings of four soybean genotypes were inoculated with Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, the causative agent of sudden death syndrome (SDS), and differentially abundant mRNAs were identified by differential display. The genotypes carried either zero, two, four or six alleles of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control resistance to SDS in an additive manner. The mRNA abundance of MIPS did not decrease following inoculation in a recombinant inbred line (RIL 23) containing all six resistance alleles of the QTLs conferring resistance to SDS of soybean. However, the abundance of MIPS mRNA was decreased in genotypes containing four, two or no resistance alleles. The specific activity of the MIPS enzyme in vitro followed the same pattern across genotypes. The IP(3) content in the inoculated roots of genotypes with two, four or six resistance alleles were higher compared to the non-inoculated root. The results suggests that a non-additive effect on transcription and translation of MIPS is established in RIL 23 roots by pyramiding six QTLs for resistance to SDS. A role of MIPS in the partial resistance or response of soybean roots to F. solani infection is suggested.
