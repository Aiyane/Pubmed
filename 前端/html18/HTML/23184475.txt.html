				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In soybean, the W4 gene encoding dihydroflavonol-4-reductase controls anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis in flowers. The mutant allele, w4-m, is characterized by variegated flowers and was evolved from the insertion of an endogenous transposable element, <span class="gene">Tgm9</span>, in intron II of the W4 gene. In the w4-m mutant line, reversion of the unstable allele from variegated to normal purple flower in revertants would indicate <span class="gene">Tgm9</span>'s excision accompanied by its insertion into a second locus. We identified a male-sterile, female-sterile mutant from such germinal revertant bearing purple flowers. The objectives of our investigation were to map the sterility locus, identify candidate genes for the male-fertile, female-fertile phenotype, and then determine if sterility is associated with the insertion of <span class="gene">Tgm9</span> in the sterility locus. We used bulked segregant analysis to map the locus to molecular linkage group J (chromosome 16). Fine mapping enabled us to flank the locus to a 62-kb region that contains only five predicted genes. One of the genes in that region, <span class="gene">Glyma16g07850.1</span>, codes for a helicase. A rice homolog of this gene has been shown to control crossing over and fertility phenotype. Thus, <span class="gene">Glyma16g07850.1</span> is most likely the gene <span class="gene">regulating the male and female fertility phenotype</span> in soybean. DNA blot analysis of the segregating individuals for <span class="gene">Tgm9</span> showed perfect <span class="gene">association between sterility and the presence of the transposon</span>. Most likely, the sterility mutation was caused by the insertion of <span class="gene">Tgm9</span>. The transposable element should facilitate identification of the male- and female-fertility gene. Characterization of the fertility gene will provide vital molecular insight on the reproductive biology of soybean and other plants.
