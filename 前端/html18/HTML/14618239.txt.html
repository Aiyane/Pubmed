				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A full-length gene <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span>, encoding the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), a key enzyme involved in polyamine biosynthesis, was identified from soybean expressed sequence tags and was characterized. <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> encoded a peptide of 355 amino acids. When compared with other plant SAMDCs, the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> protein had several highly conserved regions including a putative pro-enzyme cleavage site and a PEST sequence. The 5' leader sequence of the the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> mRNA contained two additional open reading frames (ORFs), which may regulate the translational process. The genomic sequence of the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> gene contained three introns in the 5' leader sequence, but no intron in the 3'-UTR or the main pro-enzyme ORF. A simple sequence repeat (SSR) was found in intron 2, and the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> gene was mapped to linkage group D1 using this SSR. The genomic organization of the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> gene in the subgenus Glycine and the subgenus Soja was found to be different by Southern-blot and PCR analysis. A pseudogene, GmSAMDC2, was also identified. This gene contained no intron and lost its two uORFs. Northern-blot analysis showed that the <span class="gene">GmSAMDC1</span> gene expression was induced by <span class="gene">salt, drought and cold</span>, but not induced by wounding; suggesting that the gene was implicated in response to multiple-stress conditions.
