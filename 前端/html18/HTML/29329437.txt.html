				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant root cell walls are dynamic systems that serve as the first plant compartment responsive to soil conditions, such as phosphorus (P) deficiency. To date, evidence for the regulation of root cell wall proteins (CWPs) by P deficiency remains sparse. In order to gain a better understanding of the roles played by CWPs in the roots of soybean (Glycine max) in adaptation to P deficiency, we conducted an iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) proteomic analysis. A total of 53 CWPs with differential accumulation in response to P deficiency were identified. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis correlated the accumulation of 21 of the 27 up-regulated proteins, and eight of the 26 down-regulated proteins with corresponding gene expression patterns in response to P deficiency. One up-regulated CWP, purple acid phosphatase 1-like (<span class="gene">GmPAP1</span>-like), was functionally characterized. Phaseolus vulgaris transgenic hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmPAP1</span>-like displayed an increase in root-associated acid phosphatase activity. In addition, relative growth and P content were significantly enhanced in <span class="gene">GmPAP1</span>-like overexpressing lines compared to control lines when deoxy-ribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) was applied as the sole external P source. Taken together, the results suggest that the modulation of CWPs may regulate complex changes in the root system in response to P deficiency, and that the cell wall-localized <span class="gene">GmPAP1</span>-like protein is <span class="gene">involved in extracellular dNTP utilization in soybean</span>.
