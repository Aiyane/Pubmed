				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						An alkaline isoform of the PR-5 protein (designated <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span>) has been purified from soybean hulls and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> effectively <span class="gene">inhibited in vitro the growth of Phytophthora soja spore and Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea</span>. The antimicrobial activity of <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> should be mainly ascribed to its high binding affinity with vesicles composed of DPPG, (1,3)-β-D-glucans, and weak endo-(1,3)-β-D-glucanase activity. From the 3D models, predicted by the homology modeling, <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> contains an extended negatively charged cleft. The cleft was proved to be a prerequisite for endo-(1,3)-β-D-glucanase activity. Molecular docking revealed that the positioning of linear (1,3)-β-D-glucans in the cleft of <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> allowed an interaction with Glu83 and Asp101 that were responsible for the hydrolytic cleavage of glucans. Interactions of <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> with model membranes indicated that <span class="gene">GmOLPc</span> possesses good surface activity which could contribute to its antimicrobial activity, as proved by the behavior of perturbing the integrity of membranes through surface hydrophobic amino acid residues (Phe89 and Phe94).
