				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is a relatively cold intolerant plant. In most stress tolerant plants the responsive expression of <span class="gene">dehydrin proteins</span> in vegetative tissues can be a significant contributor to protection against environmental stresses. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of dehydrins in various organs and the cold-responses of dehydrin genes in vegetative tissues of soybean. Examination of the soybean genome indicated the presence of genes encoding ten distinct dehydrins. Levels of <span class="gene">dehydrin proteins</span> were probed with several antibodies specific to dehydrins or to the signature K-sequence. A single vegetatively expressed dehydrin protein was detected and the levels were insignificantly altered in response to cold, drought, or salt stress, nor was the transcript responsive to ABA. This SK2-type, acidic dehydrin family member (<span class="gene">GmERD14</span>) was purified, identified by mass spectroscopy, and shown to be in vivo phosphorylated; indicating characteristics similar to other known acidic dehydrins. The lack of cold stress-regulated acidic dehydrin expression may contribute to the inability of soybean to cold acclimate. While transcripts for all ten dehydrins could be detected in various tissues, only three accumulated to significant levels in vegetative tissues (two of the KS type and one of SK2 type). One of these transcripts, a KS dehydrin, was accumulated following cold treatments. The accumulation of the KS dehydrin was also responsive to exogenous ABA.
