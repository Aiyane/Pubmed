					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Growth hormone auxin regulates various cellular processes by altering the expression of diverse genes in plants. Among various auxin-responsive genes, <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes maintain endogenous auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess of auxin with amino acids. <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes have been characterized in many plant species, but not in legumes. In the present work, we identified members of <span class="gene">GH3</span> gene family and analyzed their chromosomal distribution, gene structure, gene duplication and phylogenetic analysis in different legumes, including chickpea, soybean, Medicago, and Lotus. A comprehensive expression analysis in different vegetative and reproductive tissues/stages revealed that many of <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes were expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Notably, chickpea Ca<span class="gene">GH3</span>-3, soybean Gm<span class="gene">GH3</span>-8 and -25, and Lotus Lj<span class="gene">GH3</span>-4, -5, -9 and -18 genes were up-regulated in root, indicating their putative role in root development. In addition, chickpea Ca<span class="gene">GH3</span>-1 and -7, and Medicago Mt<span class="gene">GH3</span>-7, -8, and -9 were found to be highly induced under drought and/or salt stresses, suggesting their role in abiotic stress responses. We also observed the examples of differential expression pattern of duplicated <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes in soybean, indicating their functional diversification. Furthermore, analyses of three-dimensional structures, active site residues and ligand preferences provided molecular insights into function of <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes in legumes. The analysis presented here would help in investigation of precise function of <span class="gene">GH3</span> genes in legumes during development and stress conditions.
