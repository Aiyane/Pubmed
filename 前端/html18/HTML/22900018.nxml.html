						内容:  <p> Cytokinins (CKs) mediate cellular responses to drought stress and targeted control of CK metabolism can be used to develop drought-tolerant plants. Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve drought tolerance of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (<span class="gene">isopentenyltransferase</span>,  <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> ) and 17 CK degradative (<span class="gene">CK dehydrogenase</span>,  <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> ) genes. Comparative analyses of <span class="gene">GmIPT</span>s and <span class="gene">GmCKX</span>s with  <italic> Arabidopsis </italic>  counterparts revealed their similar architecture. The average numbers of abiotic stress-inducible  <italic> cis </italic> -elements per promoter were 0.4 and 1.2 for  <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic>  and  <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic>  genes, respectively, suggesting that upregulation of  <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> s, thereby reduction of CK levels, maybe the major events under abiotic stresses. Indeed, the expression of 12  <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic>  genes was upregulated by dehydration in R2 roots. Overall, the expressions of soybean CK metabolic genes in various tissues at various stages were highly responsive to drought. CK contents in various organs at the reproductive (R2) stage were also determined under well-watered and drought stress conditions. Although tRNA-type  <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic>  genes were highly expressed in soybean,  <italic> cis </italic> -zeatin and its derivatives were found at low concentrations. Moreover, reduction of total CK content in R2 leaves under drought was attributable to the decrease in dihydrozeatin levels, suggesting a role of this molecule in regulating soybean's responses to drought stress. Our systematic analysis of the  <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic>  and  <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic>  families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under drought stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach. </p>
