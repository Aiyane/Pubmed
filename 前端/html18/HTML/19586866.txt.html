					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">MYB transcription factor</span> is one of the largest families in plants, which plays an important role in regulating plant development and physiological metabolism. In this study, the expression and function of the new <span class="gene">MYB transcription factor</span> gene <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> (GenBank No. DQ902863), isolated from soybean (Glycine max L.), were characterized. The expression pattern of <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> in different organs was examined using Northern blotting analysis. The expression of <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> was detected only in the leaves. The transcriptional activation ability of <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> protein was confirmed by the yeast assay system and the activity of beta-galactosidase was 28.48 U/mL. The green fluorescent protein expression vector p163-GFP-<span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> was constructed and transformed into the epidermal cells of onion via particle bombardmental method. The results of instantaneous expression showed that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> proteins were localized in cell nucleus. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> improved the expression of certain flavonoid biosynthetic genes, such as PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia lyase), C4H (cinnamate-4-hydroxylase), 4CL (4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase), CHS (Chalcone synthase), CHI (Chalcone isomerase), F3H (Flavanone 3-hydroxylase), and FLS (Flavonol synthase), resulting an increase of the total flavonoid levels in positive tobacco transformants. Additionally, the increasing expression of <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> in soybean cultivar Zhongdou 27, induced by UV-B radiation, drought, and high-salt treatment, indicated that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ6</span> was associated with response to abiotic stresses.
