						内容:  <p> It is widely accepted that the 14-3-3 family proteins are key regulators of multiple stress signal transduction cascades. By conducting genome-wide analysis, researchers have identified the soybean 14-3-3 family proteins; however, until now, there is still no direct genetic evidence showing the involvement of soybean 14-3-3s in ABA responses. Hence, in this study, based on the latest  <italic> Glycine max </italic>  genome on Phytozome v10.3, we initially analyzed the evolutionary relationship, genome organization, gene structure and duplication, and three-dimensional structure of soybean 14-3-3 family proteins systematically. Our results suggested that soybean 14-3-3 family was highly evolutionary conserved and possessed segmental duplication in evolution. Then, based on our previous functional characterization of a  <italic> Glycine soja </italic>  14-3-3 protein GsGF14o in drought stress responses, we further investigated the expression characteristics of  <italic> GsGF14o </italic>  in detail, and demonstrated its positive roles in ABA sensitivity. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses in  <italic> Glycine soja </italic>  seedlings and GUS activity assays in P <sub> GsGF14O </sub> :GUS transgenic  <italic> Arabidopsis </italic>  showed that  <italic> GsGF14o </italic>  expression was moderately and rapidly induced by ABA treatment. As expected,  <italic> GsGF14o </italic>  overexpression in  <italic> Arabidopsis </italic>  augmented the ABA inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth, promoted the ABA induced stomata closure, and up-regulated the expression levels of ABA induced genes. Moreover, through yeast two hybrid analyses, we further demonstrated that GsGF14o physically interacted with the AREB/ABF transcription factors in yeast cells. Taken together, results presented in this study strongly suggested that  <italic> GsGF14o </italic>  played an important role in regulation of ABA sensitivity in  <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> . </p>
