				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The evening complex of ELF4-ELF3-LUX proteins is an integral component of a plant circadian clock. LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) is one of the key components of the evening complex, and that <span class="gene">play a key role in circadian rhythms and flowering</span>. Here, we report that diverged soybean LUX has the additional role in male reproductive development. We studied diurnal and circadian rhythms of soybean LUX (<span class="gene">GmLUXa</span>, <span class="gene">GmLUXb</span>, and <span class="gene">GmLUXc</span>) using qRT-PCR, and show its nuclear localisation by particle bombardment. Yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) studies indicate that both <span class="gene">GmLUXb</span> and <span class="gene">GmLUXc</span> form an evening complex with GmELF4b and GmELF3a, respectively. Ectopic expression of <span class="gene">GmLUXb</span> in Arabidopsis lux mutants can complement functions of AtLUX, whereas <span class="gene">GmLUXc</span> generates novel phenotypes of serrated leaves, stunted plants, shortened anther filament, and low seed set. Overall, our results suggest that the LUX gene has diverged in soybean where <span class="gene">GmLUXb</span> and <span class="gene">GmLUXc</span> share the role to control flowering time, but <span class="gene">GmLUXc</span> has evolved to regulate anther filament growth and seed set by regulating the Gibberellin hormone biosynthesis pathway.
