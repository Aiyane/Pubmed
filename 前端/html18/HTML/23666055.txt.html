				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Carotenoid oxygenase is a key enzyme in carotenoid metabolism leading to the synthesis of two phytohormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactone, as well as norisoprenoids. Few studies have analyzed inter-relationship of the metabolic networks of these three substances. In this present paper, soybean carotenoid oxygenase genes were identified to reveal their phylogenetic relationships, and the transcriptional response of these genes to four abiotic stresses (NaCl, PEG, high and low temperature) and ABA treatment were investigated to characterize their potential roles in plant resistance. Positive selection was found in the branches of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (<span class="gene">CCD1</span>), <span class="gene">CCD8</span> and <span class="gene">NCED</span> (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid oxygenase), indicating an adaptive evolution in these clades. In soybean eight carotenoid oxygenase genes were identified. The transcriptional responses of almost all of them under stress and ABA conditions were significantly altered when assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Notably, <span class="gene">CCD1</span> and <span class="gene">CCD4</span>, previously known as the <span class="gene">key genes in norisoprenoids metabolism, showed especially strong responses to the abiotic stresses and ABA treatment</span>. Furthermore, transcription levels of <span class="gene">CCD7</span> and <span class="gene">CCD8</span>, key genes for the strigolactone pathway, <span class="gene">highly increased during ABA treatment</span> providing further evidence that ABA is involved in regulating strigolactone metabolism. All of the carotenoid oxygenase genes in soybean are involved in plant abiotic stress physiology, and ABA is presumed to be a core regulatory substance. These findings provide some insights into the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of tolerance response to abiotic stresses in soybean.
