						内容:  <sec>  <title> Background </title>  <p> Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is the most prevalent viral disease in many soybean production areas. Due to a large number of SMV resistant loci and alleles, SMV strains and the rapid evolution in avirulence/effector genes, traditional breeding for SMV resistance is complex. Genetic engineering is an effective alternative method for improving SMV resistance in soybean. Potassium (K <sup> + </sup> ) is the most abundant inorganic solute in plant cells, and is involved in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Studies have shown that altering the level of K <sup> + </sup>  status can reduce the spread of the viral diseases. Thus K <sup> + </sup>  transporters are putative candidates to target for soybean virus resistance. </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title> Results </title>  <p> The addition of K <sup> + </sup>  fertilizer significantly reduced SMV incidence. Analysis of K <sup> + </sup>  channel gene expression indicated that  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span>, </italic>  the ortholog of  <italic> Arabidopsis </italic>  K <sup> + </sup>  weak channel encoding gene  <italic> AKT2 </italic> , was significantly induced by SMV inoculation in the SMV highly-resistant genotype Rsmv1, but not in the susceptible genotype Ssmv1. Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic>  were produced and verified by Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis. Analysis of K <sup> + </sup>  concentrations on different leaves of both the transgenic and the wildtype (Williams 82) plants revealed that overexpression of  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic>  significantly increased K <sup> + </sup>  concentrations in young leaves of plants. In contrast, K <sup> + </sup>  concentrations in the old leaves of the  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic> -Oe plants were significantly lower than those in WT plants. These results indicated that  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic>  acted as a K <sup> + </sup>  transporter and affected the distribution of K <sup> + </sup>  in soybean plants. Starting from 14&#x000a0;days after inoculation (DAI) of SMV G7, severe mosaic symptoms were observed on the WT leaves. In contrast, the  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic> -Oe plants showed no symptom of SMV infection. At 14 and 28 DAI, the amount of SMV RNA in WT plants increased 200- and 260- fold relative to  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic> -Oe plants at each time point. Thus, SMV development was significantly retarded in  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic> -overexpressing transgenic soybean plants. </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title> Conclusions </title>  <p> Overexpression of  <italic> <span class="gene">GmAKT2</span> </italic>  significantly enhanced SMV resistance in transgenic soybean. Thus, alteration of K <sup> + </sup>  transporter expression is a novel molecular approach for enhancing SMV resistance in soybean. </p>  </sec>
