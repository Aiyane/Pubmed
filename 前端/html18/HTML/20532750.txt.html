				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., has the potential to become a serious threat to soybean, Glycine max L. Merr., production in the USA. A novel rust resistance gene, <span class="gene">Rpp?(Hyuuga)</span>, from the Japanese soybean cultivar Hyuuga has been identified and mapped to soybean chromosome 6 (Gm06). Our objectives were to fine-map the <span class="gene">Rpp?(Hyuuga)</span> gene and develop a high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay to detect this <span class="gene">ASR resistance</span> gene. The integration of recombination events from two different soybean populations and the ASR reaction data indicates that the <span class="gene">Rpp?(Hyuuga)</span> locus is located in a region of approximately 371 kb between STS70887 and STS70923 on chromosome Gm06. A set of 32 ancestral genotypes which is predicted to contain 95% of the alleles present in current elite North American breeding populations and the sources of the previously reported <span class="gene">ASR resistance</span> genes (Rpp1, Rpp2, Rpp3, Rpp4, Rpp5, and rpp5) were genotyped with five SNP markers. We developed a SimpleProbe assay based on melting curve analysis for SNP06-44058 which is tighly linked to the <span class="gene">Rpp?(Hyuuga)</span> gene. This SNP assay can differentiate plants/lines that are homozygous/homogeneous or heterozygous/heterogeneous for the resistant and susceptible alleles at the <span class="gene">Rpp?(Hyuuga)</span> locus.
