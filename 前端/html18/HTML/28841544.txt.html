				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) superfamily, specifically the SNAP25-type proteins and t-SNAREs, have been proposed to regulate cellular processes and plant resistance mechanisms. However, little is known about the role of SNAP25-type proteins in combating abiotic stresses, specifically in wild soybean. In the current study, the isolation and functional characterization of the putative synaptosomal-associated SNAP25-type protein gene <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> from wild soybean (Glycine soja) were performed. <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> has a molecular weight of 33,311 Da and comprises 300 amino acid residues along with Qb-Qc SNARE domains. Multiple sequence alignment revealed the highest similarity of the <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> protein to <span class="gene">GmSNAP33</span> (91%), VrSNAP33 (89%), PvSNAP33 (86%) and AtSNAP33 (63%). Phylogenetic studies revealed the abundance of SNAP33 proteins mostly in dicotyledons. Quantitative real-time PCR assays confirmed that <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> expression can be induced by salt, alkali, ABA and PEG treatments and that <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> is highly expressed in the pods, seeds and roots of Glycine soja. Furthermore, the overexpression of the <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span> gene in WT Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in increased germination rates, greater root lengths, improved photosynthesis, lower electrolyte leakage, higher biomass production and up-regulated expression levels of various stress-responsive marker genes, including KINI, COR15A, P5Cs, RAB18, RD29A and COR47 in transgenic lines compared with those in WT lines. Subcellular localization studies revealed that the <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span>-eGFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane, while eGFP was distributed throughout whole cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that <span class="gene">GsSNAP33</span>, a novel plasma membrane protein gene of Glycine soja, might be involved in <span class="gene">improving plant responses to salt and drought stresses</span> in Arabidopsis.
