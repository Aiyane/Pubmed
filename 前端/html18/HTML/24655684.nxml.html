						内容:  <sec>  <title> Background </title>  <p> Soybean is one of the most important oil crops. The regulatory genes involved in oil accumulation are largely unclear. We initiated studies to identify genes that regulate this process. </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title> Results </title>  <p> One MYB-type gene  <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic>  was found to display differential expression in soybean seeds of different developing stages by microarray analysis and was further investigated for its functions in lipid accumulation. <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> is a small protein with single MYB repeat and has similarity to CPC-like MYB proteins from Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> interacted with GL3 and EGL3, and then suppressed  <italic> GL2 </italic> , a negative regulator of oil accumulation.  <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic>  overexpression enhanced lipid contents in both seeds and leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Seed length and thousand-seed weight were also promoted.  <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic>  introduction into the Arabidopsis  <italic> try cpc </italic>  double mutant rescued the total lipids, seed size and thousand-seed weight.  <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic>  also elevated lipid levels in seeds and leaves of transgenic Lotus, and in transgenic hairy roots of soybean plants. <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> promoted  <italic> PLD&#x003b1;1 </italic>  expression, whose promoter can be bound and inhibited by GL2.  <italic> PLD&#x003b1;1 </italic>  mutation reduced triacylglycerol levels mildly in seeds but significantly in leaves of Arabidopsis plants. </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title> Conclusions </title>  <p> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> may reduce  <italic> GL2 </italic> , and then release GL2-inhibited  <italic> PLD&#x003b1;1 </italic>  expression for lipid accumulation. Manipulation of  <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic>  may potentially improve oil production in legume crop plants. </p>  </sec>
