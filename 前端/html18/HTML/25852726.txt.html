						Drought-induced <span class="gene">(Di19) proteins</span> played important roles in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress responses. In the present study, a total of seven Di19 genes were identified in soybean. Each soybean Di19 gene showed specific responses to salt, drought, oxidative, and ABA stresses based on expression profiles. With a relatively higher transcript level among Di19 members under four stress treatments, <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> was selected for detailed analysis. Inhibitor assays revealed that ABA inhibitor (Fluridone) or H2O2 inhibitor (DMTU) was involved in the drought- or salt-induced transcription of <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span>. The GUS activity driven by the <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> promoter was induced by salt, PEG, ABA, and MV treatments and tended to be accumulated in the vascular bundles and young leaves. A subcellular localization assay showed that <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> protein localized in the nucleus. Further investigation showed that <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> protein was involved in the interaction with <span class="gene">GmLEA3.1</span>. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> increased sensitivity of transgenic Arabidopsis plants to salt, drought, oxidative, and ABA stresses and regulated expression of several ABA/stress-associated genes. This present investigation showed that <span class="gene">GmDi19-5</span> functioned as a negative factor under abiotic stresses and was involved in ABA and SOS signaling pathway by altering transcription of stress-associated genes.
