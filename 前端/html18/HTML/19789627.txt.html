				<h2>摘要</h2>

						BACKGROUND: Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is one of the most important crops for oil and protein resource. Improvement of stress tolerance will be beneficial for soybean seed production. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six <span class="gene">GmPHD</span> genes encoding Alfin1-type PHD finger protein were identified and their expressions differentially responded to <span class="gene">drought, salt, cold and ABA treatments</span>. The six <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>s were nuclear proteins and showed ability to bind the cis-element "GTGGAG". The N-terminal domain of <span class="gene">GmPHD</span> played a major role in DNA binding. Using a protoplast assay system, we find that <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>1 to <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>5 had transcriptional suppression activity whereas <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>6 did not have. In yeast assay, the <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>6 can form homodimer and heterodimer with the other <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>s except <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>2. The N-terminal plus the variable regions but not the PHD-finger is required for the dimerization. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the <span class="gene">GmPHD</span>2 showed <span class="gene">salt tolerance</span> when compared with the wild type plants. This tolerance was likely achieved by diminishing the oxidative stress through regulation of downstream genes. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide important clues for soybean stress tolerance through manipulation of PHD-type transcription regulator.
