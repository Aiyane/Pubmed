				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To discover new SNPs and develop an easy assay method in soybean, we compared the high-throughput pyrosequencing ESTs with whole genome sequences in different soybean varieties and identified 3899 SNPs. Transitions were found to be much more frequent than transversions in these SNPs. We found that SNPs were widely distributed in the soybean genome, targeting numerous genes involved in various physiological and biochemical processes influencing important agronomic traits. A set of 16 SNPs were validated in nine soybean varieties, and seven SNPs were converted into CAPS. From functional gene association analysis, the marker CAPS282 on the 3'-UTR of gene <span class="gene">Glyma07g03490</span> was identified as associated with 100-seed weight in soybean. The SNP discovery and CAPS markers conversion system developed in this study is fast and cost effective, and holds great promise for molecular-assisted breeding of soybean.
