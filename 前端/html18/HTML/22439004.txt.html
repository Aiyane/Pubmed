				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant Snf1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1) related protein kinase (SnRK), a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases, has been implicated as a crucial upstream regulator of ABA and osmotic signaling as in many other signaling cascades. In this paper, we have isolated a novel plant specific ABA activated calcium independent protein kinase (<span class="gene">GsAPK</span>) from a highly salt tolerant plant, Glycine soja (50109), which is a member of the SnRK2 family. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that <span class="gene">GsAPK</span> is localized in the plasma membrane. We found that autophosphorylation and Myelin Basis Protein phosphorylation activity of <span class="gene">GsAPK</span> is only activated by ABA and the kinase activity also was observed when calcium was replaced by EGTA, suggesting its independence of calcium in enzyme activity. We also found that cold, salinity, drought, and ABA stress alter <span class="gene">GsAPK</span> gene transcripts and heterogonous overexpression of <span class="gene">GsAPK</span> in Arabidopsis alters plant tolerance to high salinity and ABA stress. In summary, we demonstrated that <span class="gene">GsAPK</span> is a Glycine soja ABA activated calcium independent SnRK-type kinase presumably involved in ABA mediated stress signal transduction.
