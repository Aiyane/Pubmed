				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						During earlier experiments, an SSR molecular marker (176 Soy HSP) showing high correlation (70%) with <span class="gene">resistance/susceptibility to javanese root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica</span> was identified in soybean. After being sequenced, results indicated that the SSR 176 Soy HSP marker was inserted in the promoter region of <span class="gene">Gmhsp17.6-L</span> gene. It was also detected in this region that resistant genotypes presented insertions between AT(31) and AT(33) in size and susceptible genotypes, AT(9). <span class="gene">Gmhsp17.6-L</span> gene coding region presented a perfect match in amino acid sequence in all soybean genotypes. A ribonuclease protection assay showed that <span class="gene">Gmhsp17.6-L</span> gene mRNA transcripts were present in all genotypes. A real-time relative quantification (qPCR) indicated in the resistant individuals higher mRNA transcripts levels, which presented in the sequencing more AT(n) insertions. These results suggest that the number of AT(n) insertions inside this promoter region could modulate up or down gene levels. Those findings can lead to the possibility of manipulating, between some limits, the mRNA transcripts levels using different sizes of AT(n) insertions.
