					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant-specific () genes play critical roles in various plant growth and development processes. However, the number and characteristics of genes in soybean [ (L.) Merr.] remain unknown. Here, we identified 90 homologous genes in the soybean genome that phylogenetically clustered into two classes (I and II). The majority of the genes were evenly distributed across all 20 soybean chromosomes, and 77 (81.11%) of them were detected in segmental duplicated regions. Furthermore, the exon-intron organization and motif composition for each were analyzed. A close phylogenetic relationship was identified between the soybean genes and 41 previously reported genes of different plants in the same group, providing insights into their putative functions. Expression analysis indicated that more than half of the genes were expressed, with the two gene classes showing differential tissue expression characteristics; in addition, they were differentially induced by biotic and abiotic stresses. To further explore the functions of genes in soybean, was selected for functional characterization. <span class="gene">GmLBD12</span> was mainly localized to the nucleus and showed high expression in root and seed tissues. Overexpressing in (L.) Heynh resulted in <span class="gene">increases in lateral root (LR) number and plant height</span>. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that was induced by drought, salt, cold, indole acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid SA treatments. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the soybean gene family and a valuable foundation for future functional studies of genes.
