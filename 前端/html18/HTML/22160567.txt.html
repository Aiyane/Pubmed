				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant acclimation to environmental stress is controlled by a complex network of regulatory genes that compose distinct stress-response regulons. The C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) have been implicated in different cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Through microarray analysis, an alkaline (NaHCO(3))-responsive ZFP gene <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> was identified and subsequently cloned from Glyycine soja. <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> encodes a 35.14 kDa protein with one C2H2-type zinc-finger motif. The QALGGH domain, conserved in most plant C2H2-type ZFPs, is absent in the <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> protein sequence. A subcellular localization study using a GFP fusion protein indicated that <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> is localized to the nucleus. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> was induced in the leaf by ABA (100 μM), salt (200 mM NaCl), and cold (4°C), and in the root by ABA (100 μM), cold (4°C), and drought (30% PEG 6000). Over-expression of <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in a greater tolerance to cold and drought stress, a decreased water loss rate, and an increase in proline irrespective of environmental conditions. The over-expression of <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> also increased the expression of a number of stress-response marker genes, including CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, NCED3, COR47, and RD29A in response to cold stress and RAB18, NCED3, P5CS, RD22, and RD29A in response to drought stress, especially early during stress treatments. Our studies suggest that <span class="gene">GsZFP1</span> plays a crucial role in the <span class="gene">plant response to cold and drought stress</span>.
