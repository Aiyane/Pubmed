						内容:  <p> The soybean transcriptome displays strong variation along the day in optimal growth conditions and also in response to adverse circumstances, like drought stress. However, no study conducted to date has presented suitable reference genes, with stable expression along the day, for relative gene expression quantification in combined studies on drought stress and diurnal oscillations. Recently, water deficit responses have been associated with circadian clock oscillations at the transcription level, revealing the existence of hitherto unknown processes and increasing the demand for studies on plant responses to drought stress and its oscillation during the day. We performed data mining from a transcriptome-wide background using microarrays and RNA-seq databases to select an unpublished set of candidate reference genes, specifically chosen for the normalization of gene expression in studies on soybean under both drought stress and diurnal oscillations. Experimental validation and stability analysis in soybean plants submitted to drought stress and sampled during a 24 h timecourse showed that four of these newer reference genes ( <italic> <span class="gene">FYVE</span> </italic> ,  <italic> <span class="gene">NUDIX</span> </italic> ,  <italic> <span class="gene">Golgin-84</span> </italic>  and  <italic> <span class="gene">CYST</span> </italic> ) indeed exhibited greater expression stability than the conventionally used housekeeping genes ( <italic> ELF1-&#x003b2; </italic>  and  <italic> &#x003b2;-actin </italic> ) under these conditions. We also demonstrated the effect of using reference candidate genes with different stability values to normalize the relative expression data from a <span class="gene">drought-inducible</span> soybean gene ( <italic> <span class="gene">DREB5</span> </italic> ) evaluated in different periods of the day. </p>
