						KEY MESSAGE: <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> , a novel plant PAP gene in soybean, has phytase activity. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> can enhance Arabidopsis growth when phytate is the sole P source in culture. Phosphorus (P) is an important macronutrient for plant growth and development. However, most of the total P in soils is fixed into organic phosphate (Po). Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) can hydrolyze Po in the soil to liberate inorganic phosphate and enhance plant P utilization. We isolated a novel PAP gene, <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span>, from soybean (Glycine max). It had an open reading frame of 1,329 bp, encoding 442 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment and phylogenetics analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was similar to other plant PAPs with large molecular masses. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the induced expression of <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was greater in P-efficient genotype Zhonghuang15 (ZH15) than in P-inefficient genotype Niumaohuang (NMH) during the periods of flowering (28-35 days post phytate stress; DPP) and pod formation (49-63 DPP). Moreover, peak expression, at 63 DPP, was about 3-fold higher in 'ZH15' than in 'NMH'. Sub-cellular localization showed that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> might be on plasma membrane or in cytoplasm. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> in Arabidopsis resulted in significant rises in P acquisition and utilization compared with the wild-type (WT). Under phytate condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed increases of approximately 132.7 % in dry weight and 162.6 % in shoot P content compared with the WT. Furthermore, when phytate was added as the sole P source in cultures, the activity of acid phosphatase was significantly higher in transgenic plants. Therefore, <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> is a novel PAP gene that functions in plant's utilization of organic phosphate especially under phytate condition.
