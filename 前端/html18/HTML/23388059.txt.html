						BACKGROUND: <span class="gene">SKIP</span> is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. It can regulate plant stress tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis. But the homolog of <span class="gene">SKIP</span> protein in soybean has been not reported up to now. RESULTS: In this study, the expression patterns of soybean GAMYB binding protein gene (<span class="gene">GmGBP1</span>) encoding a homolog of <span class="gene">SKIP</span> protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and different day lengths. The expression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was induced by polyethyleneglycol 6000, NaCl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> had transcriptional activity in C-terminal. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> could interact with R2R3 domain of GmGAMYB1 in <span class="gene">SKIP</span> domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. In long-day (16 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette leaves; Suppression of At<span class="gene">SKIP</span> in Arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes (CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY); Arabidopsis myb33 mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. In short-day (8 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> flowered later and showed a higher level of FLOWERING LOCUS C compared with wild type. When treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> enhanced the tolerances to heat and drought stresses but reduced the tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In Arabidopsis, <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might positively regulate the flowering time by affecting CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and GAMYB directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in LDs, but <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might represse flowering by affecting FLOWERING LOCUS C and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE in autonomous pathway in SDs. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might regulate the activity of ROS-eliminating to improve the resistance to heat and drought but reduce the high-salinity tolerance.
