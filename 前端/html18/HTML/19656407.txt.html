						BACKGROUND: <span class="gene">Systemic acquired resistance</span> (SAR) is induced in non-inoculated leaves following infection with certain pathogenic strains. SAR is effective against many pathogens. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule of the SAR pathway. The development of SAR is associated with the induction of pathogenesis related (PR) genes. Arabidopsis non-expressor of PR1 (NPR1) is a regulatory gene of the SA signal pathway 123. SAR in soybean was first reported following infection with Colletotrichum trancatum that causes anthracnose disease. We investigated if SAR in soybean is regulated by a pathway, similar to the one characterized in Arabidopsis. RESULTS: Pathogenesis-related gene GmPR1 is induced following treatment of soybean plants with the SAR inducer, 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) or infection with the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora sojae. In P. sojae-infected plants, SAR was induced against the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea. Soybean <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span> genes showed high identities to Arabidopsis NPR1. They showed similar expression patterns among the organs, studied in this investigation. <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span> are the only soybean homologues of NPR1and are located in homoeologous regions. In <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span> transformed Arabidopsis npr1-1 mutant plants, SAR markers: (i) PR-1 was induced following INA treatment and (ii) BGL2 following infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst), and SAR was induced following Pst infection. Of the five cysteine residues, Cys82, Cys150, Cys155, Cys160, and Cys216 involved in oligomer-monomer transition in NPR1, Cys216 in <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span> proteins was substituted to Ser and Leu, respectively. CONCLUSION: Complementation analyses in Arabidopsis npr1-1 mutants revealed that homoeologous <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span> genes are orthologous to Arabidopsis NPR1. Therefore, SAR pathway in soybean is most likely regulated by GmNPR1 genes. Substitution of Cys216 residue, essential for oligomer-monomer transition of Arabidopsis NPR1, with Ser and Leu residues in <span class="gene">GmNPR1-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNPR1-2</span>, respectively, suggested that there may be differences between the regulatory mechanisms of GmNPR1 and Arabidopsis NPR proteins.
