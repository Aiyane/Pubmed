				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant response to environmental stresses is regulated by a complicated network of regulatory and functional genes. In this study, we isolated the putative stress-associated gene <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> (a C2H2-type Zinc finger protein gene) based on the previous finding that it was one of two genes located in the QTL region between the Satt590 and Satt567 markers related to soybean tolerance to drought. Temporal and spatial expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> was primarily expressed in roots, stems and leaf organs and was expressed at low levels in flowers and soybean pods. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> expression increased in response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. In addition, subcellular localization analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> was ubiquitously distributed in plant cells. Transgenic experiments indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> played a negative role in plant tolerance to drought. Analysis of ABA-related marker gene expression in Arabidopsis suggested that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> might be involved in the ABA-dependent pathway during the drought stress response. Taken together, these results suggest that soybean <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> <span class="gene">negatively regulates the drought response</span>.
