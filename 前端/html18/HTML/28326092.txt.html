				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean caused by the oomycete Phytophthora sojae, is a destructive disease worldwide. Ethylene response factors (ERFs) play important roles in regulating plant biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, a new ERF gene, <span class="gene">GmERF113</span>, was isolated from the highly resistant soybean 'Suinong 10.' Sequence analysis suggested that the protein encoded by <span class="gene">GmERF113</span> contained a conserved AP2/ERF domain of 58 amino acid and belonged to the B-4 subgroup of the ERF subfamily. Expression of <span class="gene">GmERF113</span> was significantly induced by P. sojae, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate. <span class="gene">GmERF113</span> protein localized to the nucleus when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, could bind to the GCC-box, and acted as a transcription activator. In addition, a region of the full-length <span class="gene">GmERF113</span>, <span class="gene">GmERF113</span>-II, interacted with a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (<span class="gene">GmbHLH</span>) in yeast cells. Full-length <span class="gene">GmERF113</span> also interacted with <span class="gene">GmbHLH</span> in planta. <span class="gene">GmERF113</span>-overexpressing transgenic plants in susceptible cultivar 'Dongnong 50' soybean exhibited increased <span class="gene">resistance to P. sojae</span> and positively regulated the expression of the pathogenesis-related genes, PR1 and PR10-1. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmERF113</span> may play a crucial role in the defense of soybean against P. sojae infection.
