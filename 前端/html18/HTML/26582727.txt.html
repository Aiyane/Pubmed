				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">Rj4</span> is a dominant gene in soybeans (Glycine max) that restricts nodulation by many strains of Bradyrhizobium elkanii. The soybean-B. elkanii symbiosis has a low nitrogen-fixation efficiency, but B. elkanii strains are highly competitive for nodulation; thus, cultivars harboring an <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele are considered favorable. Cloning the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> gene is the first step in understanding the molecular basis of <span class="gene">Rj4</span>-mediated nodulation restriction and facilitates the development of molecular tools for genetic improvement of nitrogen fixation in soybeans. We finely mapped the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> locus within a small genomic region on soybean chromosome 1, and validated one of the candidate genes as <span class="gene">Rj4</span> using both complementation tests and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout experiments. We demonstrated that <span class="gene">Rj4</span> encodes a thaumatin-like protein, for which a corresponding allele is not present in the surveyed rj4 genotypes, including the reference genome Williams 82. Our conclusion disagrees with the previous report that <span class="gene">Rj4</span> is the Glyma.01G165800 gene (previously annotated as Glyma01g37060). Instead, we provide convincing evidence that <span class="gene">Rj4</span> is Glyma.01g165800-D, a duplicated and unique version of Glyma.01g165800, that has evolved the ability to <span class="gene">control symbiotic specificity</span>.
