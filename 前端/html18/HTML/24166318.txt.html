				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The use of molecular markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) has the potential to enhance the efficiency of trait selection in plant breeding. The purpose of the present study was to identify additional QTLs for plant height, lodging, and maturity in a soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., population segregating for growth habit. In this study, 153 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and one morphological marker (<span class="gene">Dt1</span>) were used to identify QTLs associated with plant height, lodging, and maturity in 111 F2-derived lines from a cross of PI 97100 and 'Coker 237'. The F2-derived lines and two parents were grown at Athens, Ga., and Blackville, S.C., in 1994 and evaluated for phenotypic traits. The genetic linkage map of these 143 loci covered about 1600 cM and converged into 23 linkage groups. Eleven markers remained unlinked. Using interval-mapping analysis for linked markers and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), loci were tested for association with phenotypic data taken at each location as well as mean values over the two locations. In the combined analysis over locations, the major locus associated with plant height was identified as <span class="gene">Dt1</span> on linkage group (LG) L. The <span class="gene">Dt1</span> locus was also associated with lodging. This locus explained 67.7% of the total variation for plant height, and 56.4% for lodging. In addition, two QTLs for plant height (K007 on LG H and <span class="gene">A516b</span> on LG N) and one QTL for lodging (<span class="gene">cr517</span> on LG J) were identified. For maturity, two independent QTLs were identified in intervals between R051 and N100, and between B032 and CpTI, on LG K. These QTLs explained 31.2% and 26.2% of the total variation for maturity, respectively. The same QTLs were identified for all traits at each location. This consistency of QTLs may be related to a few QTLs with large effects conditioning plant height, lodging, and maturity in this population.
