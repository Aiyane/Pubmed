						内容:  <p> Priming can improve plant innate capability to deal with the stresses caused by both biotic and abiotic factors. In this study, the effect of DL-&#x003b2;-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) against  <italic> Aphis glycines </italic>  Matsumura, the soybean aphid (SA) was evaluated. We found that 25 mM BABA as a root drench had minimal adverse impact on plant growth and also efficiently protected soybean from SA infestation. In both choice and non-choice tests, SA number was significantly decreased to a low level in soybean seedlings drenched with 25 mM BABA compared to the control counterparts. BABA treatment resulted in a significant increase in the activities of several defense enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), chitinase (CHI), and &#x003b2;-1, 3-glucanase (GLU) in soybean seedlings attacked by aphid. Meanwhile, the induction of 15 defense-related genes by aphid, such as  <italic> AOS </italic> ,  <italic> CHS </italic> ,  <italic> MMP2 </italic> ,  <italic> <span class="gene">NPR1-1</span> </italic> ,  <italic> <span class="gene">NPR1-2</span> </italic> , and  <italic> PR </italic>  genes, were significantly augmented in BABA-treated soybean seedlings. Our study suggest that BABA application is a promising way to enhance soybean resistance against SA. </p>
