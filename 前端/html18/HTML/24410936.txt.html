					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The recognition of pathogen effectors triggers an innate immunity response that is mediated by two distinct types of NB-LRR proteins, the toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NB-LRR proteins and the coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR proteins. The former requires EDS1 (ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1), a central regulator of effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which functions together with PAD4 (PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4). In contrast, the latter NB-LRR proteins are independent of EDS1 but require NDR1 (NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE 1) [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> ]. The interaction among these intracellular proteins results in a regulation network of phytohormone signaling, which is mainly mediated by salicylic acid (SA) for biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, and jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) for necrotrophic pathogens [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> ]. In addition to SA, JA and ET, other phytohormones such as brassinosteroids (BR), abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, gibberellins (GA) and cytokinin (CK) also contribute to plant immune responses, with complex crosstalk between one another [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ].Previous studies indicated that the resistance to <italic> P. sojae </italic> in soybean was mediated by SA signaling [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref> ], with the <italic> NPR1 </italic> as the key component of SA-mediated signaling [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"> 38 </xref> ]. In this study, two <italic> NPR1 </italic> -like IIGs ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma02g45260</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma14g03510</span> </italic> ) were identified (Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ). However, these two genes differ from the two <italic> NPR1 </italic> -like genes reported by Sandhu et al [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref> ]. In the later study, they studied soybean leaves four dpi with <italic> P. sojae </italic> race 4 while, in the present study, we studied stems 24 hpi with <italic> P. sojae </italic> race 1. As such, these two studies are less comparable.In addition to the three major phytohormones described above, BR have also been found to enhance disease resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens in tobacco and rice [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref> ]. <italic> BAK1 </italic> is a crucial component of BR signaling, and can interact with LRR-RLK (leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase) genes such as <italic> FLS2 </italic> to promote their function in plant defense responses [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref> ]. As shown in Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> , three <italic> BAK1 </italic> homologs were identified as IIGs and all were up-regulated upon inoculation with the pathogen, suggesting a positive role of BR signaling in defense response to <italic> P. sojae </italic> .It is documented that resistance genes recognize pathogens either directly or indirectly by guarding a protein or using a decoy [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"> 13 </xref> ]. In <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> , <italic> RIN4 </italic> is &#x02018;guarded&#x02019; by resistance genes <italic> RPM1 </italic> and <italic> RPS2 </italic> , which trigger the immune response [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref> ]. In soybean, two of four <italic> RIN4 </italic> - homologous genes appear to function as a heteromeric complex in mediating RPG1-B and RPM1-derived resistance to <italic> Pseudomonas syringae </italic> , and silencing <italic> <span class="gene">GmRIN4a</span> </italic> or <italic> <span class="gene">GmRIN4b</span> </italic> in <italic> rpg1-b </italic> plants enhances basal resistance to virulent strains of <italic> P. syringae </italic> and the oomycete <italic> P. sojae </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"> 50 </xref> ]. In our study, a single <italic> RIN4 </italic> homolog was found to be up-regulated in C-III NILs, but not in NILs within C-I and C-II. If this <italic> RIN4 </italic> homolog did encode the &#x0201c;guard&#x0201d; protein that was recognized by the <italic> Rps </italic> genes in the C-III NILs, then the relatively low numbers of IIGs identified among NILs in C-I and C-II, as compared with the C-III NILs, may be explained by the distinct &#x0201c;recognition&#x0201d; processes needed for triggering the immune response, which may result in variations in speed, timing, and magnitude of molecular responses to the pathogen [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48"> 48 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51"> 51 </xref> ].
