				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Although extensive studies and remarkable progress have been made with Arabidopsis calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), knowledge of their functions in other plant species is still limited. Here we isolated gene <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> from soybean, a homolog of AtCBL1 in Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> was differentially induced by multiple <span class="gene">abiotic stress</span> and plant hormones, and its transcripts were abundant in seedlings and mature roots. We over-expressed <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> in Arabidopsis and found that it enhanced tolerances to both high salt and drought stresses in the transgenic plants. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> also promoted hypocotyl elongation under light conditions. <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> may regulate stress tolerance through activation of stress-related genes, and may control hypocotyl development by altering the expression of gibberellin biosynthesis-related genes. This study identifies a putative soybean CBL gene that functions in both stress tolerance and light-dependent hypocotyl development.
