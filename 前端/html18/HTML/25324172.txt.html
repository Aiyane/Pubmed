				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed-size/weight traits, controlled by multiple genes in soybean, play an important role in determining seed yield. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the seed size and weight in soybean remain unclear. In Arabidopsis, P450/CYP78A gene family has been proved extremely <span class="gene">relevant to seed size</span> (such as <span class="gene">AtCYP78A5</span>, <span class="gene">AtCYP78A6</span> and <span class="gene">AtCYP78A9</span>). We found that a soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene underwent artificial selection during soybean breeding. The <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>a allele mainly distributed in wild soybean (Glycine soja), but has been eliminated in the cultivars during early stage of soybean breeding, while the <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>b allele has been accumulated and become the predominant allele in cultivated soybean (G. max). ANOVA analysis showed that the mean seed weight, seed width and seed thickness of soybean varieties with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>b allele was significantly heavier/bigger than those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>a allele (P &lt; 0.01). The allele could explain 7.2 % variation in seed weight. The pod number of the soybeans with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>b allele significantly decreased compared to those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>a allele (P &lt; 0.01, R(2) = 5.8 %), while other agronomic traits including seed weight/plant were not significantly affected by these two alleles. We speculated that during the early stage of soybean breeding, breeders selected big seed carrying <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span>b allele, but lowered pod number simultaneously. Overall, the selection did not cause the significantly change in soybean seed yield. Our results suggests that the soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene may have a similar function to those genes belonging to P450/CYP78A subfamily in Arabidopsis and provides new information for the genetic control of seed size in soybean.
