						内容:  <p content-type="toc-graphic">  <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pr-2015-00617n_0008" id="ab-tgr1"/>  </p>  <p> Legume crops present important agronomicaland environmental advantagesmainly due to their capacity to reduce atmospheric N <sub> 2 </sub>  toammonium via symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). This process is verysensitive to abiotic stresses such as drought, but the mechanism underlyingthis response is not fully understood. The goal of the current workis to compare the drought response of two legumes with high economicimpact and research importance,  <italic> Medicago truncatula </italic>  and  <italic> Glycine max </italic> , by characterizingtheir root nodule proteomes. Our results show that, although  <italic> M. truncatula </italic>  exhibits lower water potential valuesunder drought conditions compared to  <italic> G. max </italic> , SNF declined analogously in the two legumes. Both of their noduleproteomes are very similar, and comparable down-regulation responsesin the diverse protein functional groups were identified (mainly proteinsrelated to the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur). We suggestlipoxygenases and protein turnover as newly recognized players inSNF regulation. Partial drought conditions applied to a split-rootsystem resulted in the local down-regulation of the entire proteomeof drought-stressed nodules in both legumes. The high degree of similaritybetween both legume proteomes suggests that the vast amount of researchconducted on  <italic> M. truncatula </italic>  could beapplied to economically important legume crops, such as soybean. </p>
