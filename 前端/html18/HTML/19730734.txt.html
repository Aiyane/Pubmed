						BACKGROUND: Trihelix transcription factors play important roles in light-regulated responses and other developmental processes. However, their functions in abiotic stress response are largely unclear. In this study, we identified two trihelix transcription factor genes <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> from soybean and further characterized their roles in abiotic stress tolerance. FINDINGS: Both genes can be induced by various abiotic stresses, and the encoded proteins were localized in nuclear region. In yeast assay, <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> but not <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> exhibits ability of transcriptional activation and dimerization. The N-terminal peptide of 153 residues in <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> was the minimal activation domain and the middle region between the two trihelices mediated the dimerization of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span>. Transactivation activity of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> was also confirmed in plant cells. DNA binding analysis using yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> could bind to GT-1bx, GT-2bx, mGT-2bx-2 and D1 whereas <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> could bind to the latter three elements. Overexpression of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> <span class="gene">improved plant tolerance to salt, freezing and drought stress</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span>-transgenic plants had more green seedlings compared to Col-0 under ABA treatment. Many stress-responsive genes were altered in <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span>- and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span>-transgenic plants. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> confer stress tolerance through regulation of a common set of genes and specific sets of genes. <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> also affects ABA sensitivity.
