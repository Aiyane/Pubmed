				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The zinc finger protein is one of the proteins with finger-like domain. Some of them are transcription factors which play important role in plant growth and plant resistance to abiotic stresses. In this paper, a novel C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> (GenBank accession number JQ692081) was isolated from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) This gene has a 699 bp ORF (open reading frame) with no intron and encodes a 24.9 kDa protein with 233 amino acids. Its isoelectric point (pI) is 8.33. The <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> protein contains two typical C2H2-type zinc finger domains. Both of them have highly conserved amino acid sequence-QALGGH which is a particular characteristic of plant. Transient expression of the GFP-<span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> protein in onion epidermal cell showed that <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> was localized in cell nuclei. RT-PCR results showed that <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> gene was expressed with high levels in flowers and leaves in soybean, but low in roots and stems. The expression of <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> gene was strongly induced by low temperature in the soybean seedlings. Overexpression of <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> <span class="gene">enhanced cold tolerance</span> of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) compared to the control.
