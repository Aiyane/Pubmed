				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the major crops worldwide and flooding stress affects the production and expansion of cultivated areas. Oxygen is essential for mitochondrial aerobic respiration to supply the energy demand of plant cells. Because oxygen diffusion in water is 10,000 times lower than in air, partial (hypoxic) or total (anoxic) oxygen deficiency is important component of flooding. Even when oxygen is externally available, oxygen deficiency frequently occurs in bulky, dense or metabolically active tissues such as phloem, meristems, seeds, and fruits. In this study, we analyzed conserved and divergent root transcriptional responses between <span class="gene">flood-tolerant</span> Embrapa 45 and flood-sensitive BR 4 soybean cultivars under <span class="gene">hypoxic stress</span> conditions with RNA-seq. To understand how soybean genes evolve and respond to <span class="gene">hypoxia</span>, stable and differentially expressed genes were characterized structurally and compositionally comparing its mechanistic relationship. Between cultivars, Embrapa 45 showed less up- and more down-regulated genes, and stronger induction of phosphoglucomutase (<span class="gene">Glyma05g34790</span>), unknown protein related to N-terminal protein myristoylation (<span class="gene">Glyma06g03430</span>), protein suppressor of phyA-105 (<span class="gene">Glyma06g37080</span>), and fibrillin (<span class="gene">Glyma10g32620</span>). RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of non-symbiotic hemoglobin (<span class="gene">Glyma11g12980</span>) indicated divergence in gene structure between cultivars. Transcriptional changes for genes in amino acids and derivative metabolic process suggest involvement of amino acids metabolism in tRNA modifications, translation accuracy/efficiency, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in both cultivars under <span class="gene">hypoxia</span>. Gene groups differed in promoter TATA box, ABREs (ABA-responsive elements), and CRT/DREs (C-repeat/dehydration-responsive elements) frequency. Gene groups also differed in structure, composition, and codon usage, indicating biological significances. Additional data suggests that cis-acting ABRE elements can mediate gene expression independent of ABA in soybean roots under <span class="gene">hypoxia</span>.
