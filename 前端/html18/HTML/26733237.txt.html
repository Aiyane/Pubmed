				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs)</span> are plant-specific calcium sensors that play important roles in various aspects of plant physiology. Here, we investigated phylogenic relationships, chromosomal locations, gene structures, and tissue-specific, herbivory- and drought-induced expression profiles of soybean (Glycine max) <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span>. Fifty GmCDPK genes were identified, which phylogenetically grouped into 4 distinct clusters and distributed across 13 sub-clusters. Individual classes of <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> harbor highly conserved mRNA splicing sites, and their exon numbers and lengths were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that at least 13 ancestral CDPK genes had emerged before the split of monocots and eudicots. Gene expression analysis indicated that several <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> were tissue-specific expressed. <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span>' transcript levels changed after wounding, exhibited specific expression patterns after simulated Spodoptera exigua feeding or soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) herbivory, and were largely independent of the phytohormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. The most pronounced transcriptional responses were detected after drought and abscisic acid treatments with more than half of all <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> being upregulated, suggesting their important roles during abiotic stress responses in soybean. Our data provide an important foundation for further functional dissection of <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span>, especially in the context of soybean-insect interactions and drought stress adaptation.
