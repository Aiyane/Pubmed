						BACKGROUND: Strigolactones (SLs) play important roles in controlling root growth, shoot branching, and plant-symbionts interaction. Despite the importance, the components of SL biosynthesis and signaling have not been unequivocally explored in soybean. RESULTS: Here we identified the putative components of SL synthetic enzymes and signaling proteins in soybean genome. Soybean genome contains conserved MORE AXILLARY BRANCHING (MAX) orthologs, <span class="gene">GmMAX1s</span>, <span class="gene">GmMAX2s</span>, <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>s, and <span class="gene">GmMAX4s</span>. The tissue expression patterns are coincident with SL synthesis in roots and signaling in other tissues under normal conditions. GmMAX1a, GmMAX2a, <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b, and GmMAX4a expression in their Arabidopsis orthologs' mutants not only restored most characteristic phenotypes, such as shoot branching and shoot height, leaf shape, primary root length, and root hair growth, but also restored the significantly changed hormone contents, such as reduced JA and ABA contents in all mutant leaves, but increased auxin levels in atmax1, atmax3 and atmax4 mutants. Overexpression of these GmMAXs also altered the hormone contents in wild-type Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b was further characterized in soybean nodulation with overexpression and knockdown transgenic hairy roots. <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b overexpression (<span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-OE) lines exhibited increased nodule number while <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b knockdown (<span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-KD) decreased the nodule number in transgenic hairy roots. The expression levels of several key nodulation genes were also altered in <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b transgenic hairy roots. <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b overexpression hairy roots had reduced ABA, but increased JA levels, with no significantly changed auxin content, while the contrast changes were observed in <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-KD lines. Global gene expression in <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-OE or <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-KD hairy roots also revealed that altered expression of <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b in soybean hairy roots changed several subsets of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling and transcriptional regulation of nodulation processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only revealed the conservation of SL biosynthesis and signaling in soybean, but also showed possible interactions between SL and other hormone synthesis and signaling during controlling plant development and soybean nodulation. <span class="gene">GmMAX3</span>b-mediated SL biosynthesis and signaling may be involved in soybean nodulation by affecting both root hair formation and its interaction with rhizobia.
