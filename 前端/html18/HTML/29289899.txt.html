				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">Phytic acid (PA)</span> is implicative in a spectrum of biochemical and physiological processes involved in plant stress response. Inositol 1,3,4, Tris phosphate 5/6 kinase (ITPK), a polyphosphate kinase that converts Inositol 1,3,4 trisphosphate to Inositol 1,3,4,5/6 tetra phosphate, averting the inositol phosphate pool towards PA biosynthesis, is a key regulator that exists in four different isoforms in soybean. In the present study, in-silico analysis of the promoter region of ITPKs was done and among the four isoforms, promoter region of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> showed the presence of two MYB binding elements for drought inducibility and one for ABA response. Expression profiling through qRT-PCR under drought and salinity stress showed higher expression of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform compared to the other members of the family. The study revealed <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> as an early dehydration responsive gene which is also induced by dehydration and exogenous treatment with ABA. To evaluate the osmo-protective role of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span>, attempts were made to assess the bacterial growth on Luria Broth media containing 200 mM NaCl, 16% PEG and 100 μM ABA, individually. The transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> gene depicted better growth on the media compared to the bacterial cells containing the vector alone. Similarly, the growth of the transformed cells in the liquid media containing 200 mM NaCl, 16% PEG and 100 μM ABA showed higher absorbance at 600 nm compared to control, at different time intervals. The <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> recombinant E. coli cells showing <span class="gene">tolerance to drought and salinity</span> thus demonstrated the functional redundancy of the gene across taxa. The purity and specificity of the recombinant protein was assessed and confirmed through PAGE showing a band of ∼35 kDa on western blotting using Anti- Penta His- HRP conjugate antibody. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report exemplifying the role of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform in drought and salinity tolerance in soybean.
