				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nitrogen is an important macronutrient required for plant growth, and is a limiting factor for crop productivity. Improving the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is therefore crucial. At present, the NUE mechanism is unclear and information on the genes associated with NUE in soybeans is lacking. cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) domain-containing proteins (CDCPs) may be implicated in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. We identified and classified a CBS domain-containing protein superfamily in soybean. A candidate gene for NUE, <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span>, was identified. <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span> gene characteristics, the temporal expression pattern of the <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span> gene, and the phenotype of <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span> overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana under low nitrogen stress were analyzed. The phenotypes suggested that the transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings performed better under the nitrogen-deficient condition. <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span>-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit higher low nitrogen stress tolerance than WT plants, and this suggests its role in low nitrogen stress tolerance in plants. We conclude that <span class="gene">GmCBS21</span> may serve as an excellent candidate for breeding crops with enhanced NUE and better yield.
