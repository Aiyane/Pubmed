				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Using mixed resistance gene analogs as probes, a putative resistance gene (<span class="gene">KR1</span>) was isolated from soybean and characterized further. The <span class="gene">KR1</span> protein consists of a Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) domain, a nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain, an imperfect leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and two C-terminal transmembrane segments. Due to these features, <span class="gene">KR1</span> represents a distinct member in the TIR-NBS-LRR class of resistance genes. Southern-blot analysis indicated that there were several <span class="gene">KR1</span>-related sequences within the soybean genome, and two polymorphic loci were mapped onto linkage group L. <span class="gene">KR1</span> was induced by SA treatment and soybean mosaic virus (SMV) infection in the resistant line (Kefeng 1). An orthologue (<span class="gene">NR1</span>) and a homologue (<span class="gene">NR2</span>) of the <span class="gene">KR1</span> gene were also identified in the SMV susceptible-line Nannong1138-2. Sequencing analysis revealed that <span class="gene">NR2</span> was highly homologous to <span class="gene">KR1</span> and <span class="gene">NR1</span>, but had a 21-bp deletion. Moreover, the <span class="gene">NR1</span>, <span class="gene">NR2</span> transcription and the ratio of <span class="gene">NR1</span>/ <span class="gene">NR2</span> was up-regulated by viral infection in Nannong1138-2. These results indicated the complexity of the regulatory mechanism in the plant responses to SMV infection.
