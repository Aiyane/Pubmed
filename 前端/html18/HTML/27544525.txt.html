						KEY MESSAGE: The Rsv1 - h gene in cultivar Suweon 97, which confers resistance to SMVs, was mapped to a 97.5-kb location (29,815,195-29,912,667 bp on chromosome 13) in the Rsv1 locus, thereby providing additional insights into the molecular nature underlying variations in resistance alleles in this particular locus. Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is a well-known devastating pathogen of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill.) causing significant yield losses and seed quality deterioration. A single dominant allele, Rsv1-h, which confers resistance to multiple SMV strains, was previously reported in the cultivar Suweon 97, but its exact location is unknown. In the present study, Suweon 97 was crossed with a SMV-sensitive cultivar, Williams 82. Inoculating 267 F 2 individuals with two Chinese SMV strains (SC6-N and SC7-N) demonstrated that one single dominant gene confers SMV resistance. Another 1,150 F 2 individuals were then screened for two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (BARCSOYSSR_13_1103 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1187) that flank the Rsv1 locus. Seventy-four recombinants were identified and 20 additional polymorphic SSR markers within the Rsv1 region were then employed in genotyping these recombinants. F 2:3 and F 3:4 recombinant lines were also inoculated with SC6-N and SC7-N to determine their phenotypes. The final data revealed that in Suweon 97, the Rsv1-h gene that confers <span class="gene">resistance to SC6-N and SC7</span>-N was flanked by BARCSOYSSR_13_1114 and BARCSOYSSR_13_1115, two markers that delimit a 97.5-kb region in the reference Williams 82 genome. In such region, eight genes were present, of which two, Glyma13g184800 and Glyma13g184900, encode the characteristic CC-NBS-LRR type of resistance gene and were considered potential candidates for Rsv1-h.
