						内容:<sec><title> Background </title><p> Plants involved in highly complex and well-coordinated systems have evolved a considerable degree of developmental plasticity, thus minimizing the damage caused by stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as key regulators in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress tolerance in plants. </p></sec><sec><title> Results </title><p> In this study, soybean miRNAs associated with stress responses (drought, <span class="gene">salinity, and alkalinity</span>) have been identified and analyzed in combination with deep sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. One hundred and thirty three conserved miRNAs representing 95 miRNA families were expressed in soybeans under three treatments. In addition, 71, 50, and 45 miRNAs are either uniquely or differently expressed under drought, <span class="gene">salinity, and alkalinity</span>, respectively, suggesting that many miRNAs are inducible and are differentially expressed in response to certain stress. </p></sec><sec><title> Conclusion </title><p> Our study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of miRNAs in<italic> Glycine max </italic>. </p></sec>
