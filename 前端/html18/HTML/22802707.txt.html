				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The study of tolerance mechanisms for drought stress in soybean is fundamental to the understanding and development of tolerant varieties. Using in silico analysis, four marker genes involved in the classical <span class="gene">ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways</span> of drought response were identified in the Glycine max genome in the present work. The expression profiles of the marker genes ERD1-like, <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A</span>-like, <span class="gene">GmaxRD22</span>-like and <span class="gene">GmaxRD29B</span>-like were investigated by qPCR in root samples of drought sensitive and tolerant soybean cultivars (BR 16 and Embrapa 48, respectively), submitted to water deficit conditions in hydroponic and pot-based systems. Among the four putative soybean homologs to Arabidopsis genes investigated herein, only <span class="gene">GmaxRD29B</span>-like was not regulated by water deficit stress. Distinct expression profiles and different induction levels were observed among the genes, as well as between the two drought-inducing systems. Our results showed contrasting gene expression responses for the <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A</span>-like and <span class="gene">GmaxRD22</span>-like genes. <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A</span>-like was highly induced by continuous drought acclimating conditions, whereas <span class="gene">GmaxRD22</span>-like responses decreased after abrupt water deprivation. GmaxERD1-like showed a different expression profile for the cultivars in each system. Conversely, <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A</span>-like and <span class="gene">GmaxRD22</span>-like genes exhibited similar expression levels in tolerant plants in both systems.
