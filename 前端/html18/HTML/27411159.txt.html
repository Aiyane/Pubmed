				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Salicylic acid (SA), an essential regulator of plant defense, is derived from chorismate via either the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (<span class="gene">PAL</span>) or the isochorismate synthase (<span class="gene">ICS</span>) catalyzed steps. The <span class="gene">ICS</span> pathway is thought to be the primary contributor of defense-related SA, at least in Arabidopsis. We investigated the relative contributions of <span class="gene">PAL</span> and <span class="gene">ICS</span> to defense-related SA accumulation in soybean (Glycine max). Soybean plants silenced for five <span class="gene">PAL</span> isoforms or two <span class="gene">ICS</span> isoforms were analyzed for SA concentrations and SA-derived defense responses to the hemibiotrophic pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Phytophthora sojae. We show that, unlike in Arabidopsis, <span class="gene">PAL</span> and <span class="gene">ICS</span> pathways are equally important for <span class="gene">pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis</span> in soybean. Knock-down of either pathway shuts down SA biosynthesis and abrogates pathogen resistance. Moreover, unlike in Arabidopsis, pathogen infection is associated with the suppression of <span class="gene">ICS</span> gene expression. Pathogen-induced biosynthesis of SA via the <span class="gene">PAL</span> pathway correlates inversely with phenylalanine concentrations. Although infections with either virulent or avirulent strains of the pathogens increase SA concentrations, resistance protein-mediated response to avirulent P. sojae strains may function in an SA-independent manner. These results show that <span class="gene">PAL</span>- and <span class="gene">ICS</span>-catalyzed reactions function cooperatively in soybean defense and highlight the importance of <span class="gene">PAL</span> in <span class="gene">pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis</span>.
