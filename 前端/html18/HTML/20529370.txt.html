						BACKGROUND: Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines, SCN) is the most economically damaging pathogen of soybean (Glycine max) in the U.S. The Rhg1 locus is repeatedly observed as the quantitative trait locus with the greatest impact on <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span>. The <span class="gene">Glyma18g02680.1</span> gene at the Rhg1 locus that encodes an apparent leucine-rich repeat transmembrane receptor-kinase (LRR-kinase) has been proposed to be the <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span> gene, but its function has not been confirmed. Generation of fertile transgenic soybean lines is difficult but methods have been published that test <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span> in transgenic roots generated with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. RESULTS: We report use of artificial microRNA (amiRNA) for gene silencing in soybean, refinements to transgenic root <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span> assays, and functional tests of the Rhg1 locus LRR-kinase gene. A nematode demographics assay monitored infecting nematode populations for their progress through developmental stages two weeks after inoculation, as a metric for <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span>. Significant differences were observed between resistant and susceptible control genotypes. Introduction of the Rhg1 locus LRR-kinase gene (genomic promoter/coding region/terminator; Peking/PI 437654-derived SCN-resistant source), into rhg1- SCN-susceptible plant lines carrying the resistant-source Rhg4+ locus, provided no significant increases in <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span>. Use of amiRNA to reduce expression of the LRR-kinase gene from the Rhg1 locus of Fayette (PI 88788 source of Rhg1) also did not detectably alter resistance to SCN. However, silencing of the LRR-kinase gene did have impacts on root development. CONCLUSION: The nematode demographics assay can expedite testing of transgenic roots for <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span>. amiRNAs and the pSM103 vector that drives interchangeable amiRNA constructs through a soybean polyubiqutin promoter (Gmubi), with an intron-GFP marker for detection of transgenic roots, may have widespread use in legume biology. Studies in which expression of the Rhg1 locus LRR-kinase gene from different resistance sources was either reduced or complemented did not reveal significant impacts on <span class="gene">SCN resistance</span>.
