				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], caused by Phytophthora sojae Kaufmann and Gerdemann, is a destructive disease throughout the soybean planting regions in the world. Here, we report insights into the function and underlying mechanisms of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) in soybean, namely <span class="gene">GmERF5</span>, in host responses to P. sojae. <span class="gene">GmERF5</span>-overexpressing transgenic soybean exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to P. sojae and positively regulated the expression of the PR10, PR1-1, and PR10-1 genes. Sequence analysis suggested that <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> contains an AP2/ERF domain of 58 aa and a conserved ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif in its C-terminal region. Following stress treatments, <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> was significantly induced by P. sojae, ethylene (ET), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA). The activity of the <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> promoter (<span class="gene">GmERF5</span>P) was upregulated in tobacco leaves with ET, ABA, Phytophthora nicotianae, salt, and drought treatments, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> could be involved not only in the induced defence response but also in <span class="gene">the ABA-mediated pathway of salt and drought tolerance</span>. <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> could bind to the GCC-box element and act as a repressor of gene transcription. It was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> interacted with a basic helix-loop-helix <span class="gene">transcription factor</span> (<span class="gene">GmbHLH</span>) and <span class="gene">eukaryotic translation initiation factor</span> (<span class="gene">GmEIF</span>) both in yeast cells and in planta. To the best of our knowledge, <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> is the first soybean EAR motif-containing ERF <span class="gene">transcription factor</span> demonstrated to be involved in the response to pathogen infection.
