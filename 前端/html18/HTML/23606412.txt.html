				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The WRKY-type transcription factors are involved in plant development and stress responses, but how the regulation of stress tolerance is related to plant development is largely unknown. <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> was initially identified as a <span class="gene">stress response gene using large-scale Glycine soja microarrays</span>. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of this gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), salt, cold, and drought. Overexpression of <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> in Arabidopsis resulted in a decreased sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth. However, compared with the wild type, <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> overexpression lines were more sensitive to ABA in stomatal closure, and exhibited a greater tolerance to drought stress, a decreased water loss rate, and a decreased stomatal density. Moreover, microarray and qRT-PCR assays showed that <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> mediated ABA signalling by promoting the expression of negative regulators of ABA signalling, such as AtWRKY40, ABI1, and ABI2, while repressing the expression of the positive regulators of ABA, for example ABI5, ABI4, and ABF4. Interestingly, <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> also positively regulates the expression of a group of wax biosynthetic genes. Further, evidence is provided to support that <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> overexpression lines have more epicuticular wax crystals and a much thicker cuticle, which contribute to less chlorophyll leaching compared with the wild type. Taken together, the findings reveal an important role for <span class="gene">Gs<span class="gene">WRKY20</span> in enhancing drought tolerance and regulating ABA signalling.
