					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Salicylic acid plays a critical role in activating plant defence responses after pathogen attack. Salicylic acid methyltransferase (SAMT) modulates the level of salicylic acid by converting salicylic acid to methyl salicylate. Here, we report that a SAMT gene from soybean (<span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span>) plays a role in soybean defence against soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, SCN). <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> was identified as a candidate SCN defence-related gene in our previous analysis of soybean defence against SCN using GeneChip microarray experiments. The current study started with the isolation of the full-length cDNAs of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> from a SCN-resistant soybean line and from a SCN-susceptible soybean line. The two cDNAs encode proteins of identical sequences. The <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. Using in vitro enzyme assays, E. coli-expressed <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> was confirmed to function as salicylic acid methyltransferase. The apparent Km value of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> for salicylic acid was approximately 46 μM. To determine the role of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> in soybean defence against SCN, transgenic hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> were produced and tested for SCN resistance. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> in SCN-susceptible backgrounds significantly reduced the development of SCN, indicating that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> in the transgenic hairy root system could confer resistance to SCN. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> in transgenic hairy roots was also found to affect the expression of selected genes involved in salicylic acid biosynthesis and salicylic acid signal transduction.
