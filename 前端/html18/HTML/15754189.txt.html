				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						By using cDNA-AFLP, we analyzed a recombinant inbred line population of soybean that was derived from a <span class="gene">soybean mosaic virus (SMV) resistant</span> cultivar Kefeng No.1 and a susceptible cultivar Nannong 1138-2. One hundred and eight fragments showing polymorphism between SMV resistant and susceptible pools were identified. One fragment w27 was 96 bp in length and showed homology to homeobox ggth with a coding region of 738 bp, encoding a protein of 245 amino acids. The genomic sequence analysis defined an intron of 521 bp in the coding region. <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> was characterized by the presence of a homeodomain (HD) with a closely linked leucine zipper motif (Zip). Southern blot analysis indicated that there was a single copy of <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> in the soybean genome. When inoculated with SMV strain N3, resistant and susceptible varieties showed reduced and increased expression of the <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span>, respectively. The fusion protein of <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> with GFP was targeted only in nucleus. Yeast two hybrid studies revealed that the <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> had transcriptional activation activity and can form homodimer. <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> can bind two 9-bp pseudopalindromic elements (CAAT(A/T)ATTG and CAAT(C/G)ATTG) with different affinity. Using GUS as a reporter gene, <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> was proved to be a transcriptional activator and enhanced GUS expression by binding with the two elements in plant cells. These results indicate that the <span class="gene">GmHZ1</span> may have a transcriptional activator function in plant response to SMV infection.
