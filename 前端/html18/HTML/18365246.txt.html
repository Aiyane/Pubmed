				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						From soybean plant, 131 bZIP genes were identified and named as GmbZIPs. The GmbZIPs can be classified into ten groups and more than one third of these GmbZIPs are responsive to at least one of the four treatments including ABA, salt, drought and cold stresses. Previous studies have shown that group A bZIP proteins are involved in ABA and stress signaling. We now chose four non-group A genes to study their features. The four proteins <span class="gene">GmbZIP44</span>, GmbZIP46, <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> belong to the group S, I, C and G, respectively, and can bind to GLM (GTGAGTCAT), ABRE (CCACGTGG) and PB-like (TGAAAA) elements with differential affinity in both the yeast one-hybrid assay and in vitro gel-shift analysis. GmbZIP46 can form homodimer or heterodimer with <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> or GmMYB76. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the <span class="gene">GmbZIP44</span>, <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> or <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> showed reduced ABA sensitivity. However, all the transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt and freezing stresses when compared with the Col plants. The <span class="gene">GmbZIP44</span>, <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> may function in ABA signaling through upregulation of ABI1 and ABI2 and play roles in stress tolerance through regulation of various stress-responsive genes. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmbZIP44</span>, <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> are negative regulators of ABA signaling and function in salt and freezing tolerance.
