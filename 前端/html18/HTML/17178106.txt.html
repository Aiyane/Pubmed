				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A novel <span class="gene">DREB (dehydration responsive element binding protein) homologous</span> gene, <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span>, was isolated from soybean. Based on its similarity with AP2 domains, <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> was classified into A-5 subgroup in DREB subfamily in AP2/EREBP family. Expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> gene was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses and abscisic acid treatment. The <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> bound specifically to DRE element in vitro. Furthermore, the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> activated expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought and high-salt stresses and did not cause growth retardation. Analysis of free proline contents in transgenic tobacco indicated that the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> accumulated higher level of free proline compared to the wild type plants under drought condition. The results from this study indicate that this novel soybean <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> gene functions as an important transcriptional activator and may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants.
