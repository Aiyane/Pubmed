				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing <span class="gene">β-glucosidase</span> (<span class="gene">GmICHG</span>) of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] catalyzes the specific hydrolysis of isoflavone conjugates (β-7-O-(malonyl)glucosides of isoflavones) to produce free isoflavones. In this study, changes in the transcription levels of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> in the individual organs of soybean seedlings (cv. Enrei) in response to microbial infection and abiotic stresses were analyzed and compared with those of genes coding for 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (GmIFS) and isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase (GmIF7GT). <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> was originally expressed in abundance only in the roots and at low levels only in the other organs. The transcription of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> in the roots and other organs was suppressed upon infection of the roots by Phytophthora sojae. Upon wounding of the cotyledon, a transient long-distance up-regulation of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> transcription in the roots was observed; upon fungal infection in the cotyledon, however, a delayed elevation of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> transcription took place in the roots with the maximum at 10 h after the infection. Such long-distance up-regulation patterns were not observed with either GmIFS or GmIF7GT. The transcription levels of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> remained essentially unchanged upon treatment of the roots with Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The transcription of <span class="gene">GmICHG</span> in the roots was also sensitive to a variety of stresses on the roots, such as flooding, elicitation with yeast extract, drought, and treatment with plant hormones such as abscisic, salicylic, and jasmonic acids and ethylene.
