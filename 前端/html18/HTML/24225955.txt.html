					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) catalyzes the limiting reaction in plant and microbial biosynthesis of cysteine. In addition to its enzymatic function, SAT forms a macromolecular complex with O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. Formation of the cysteine regulatory complex (CRC) is a critical biochemical control feature in plant sulfur metabolism. Here we present the 1.75-3.0 Å resolution x-ray crystal structures of soybean (Glycine max) SAT (<span class="gene">GmSAT</span>) in apoenzyme, serine-bound, and CoA-bound forms. The <span class="gene">GmSAT</span>-serine and <span class="gene">GmSAT</span>-CoA structures provide new details on substrate interactions in the active site. The crystal structures and analysis of site-directed mutants suggest that His(169) and Asp(154) form a catalytic dyad for general base catalysis and that His(189) may stabilize the oxyanion reaction intermediate. Glu(177) helps to position Arg(203) and His(204) and the β1c-β2c loop for serine binding. A similar role for ionic interactions formed by Lys(230) is required for CoA binding. The <span class="gene">GmSAT</span> structures also identify Arg(253) as important for the enhanced catalytic efficiency of SAT in the CRC and suggest that movement of the residue may stabilize CoA binding in the macromolecular complex. Differences in the effect of cold on <span class="gene">GmSAT</span> activity in the isolated enzyme versus the enzyme in the CRC were also observed. A role for CRC formation as a molecular chaperone to maintain SAT activity in response to an <span class="gene">environmental stress</span> is proposed for this multienzyme complex in plants.
