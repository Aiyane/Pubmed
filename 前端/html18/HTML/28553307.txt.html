					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] caused by the oomycete Phytophthora sojae, is a destructive disease worldwide. The molecular mechanism of the soybean response to P. sojae is largely unclear. We report a novel WRKY transcription factor (TF) in soybean, <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span>, in the host response to P. sojae. Overexpression and RNA interference analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span> enhanced resistance to P. sojae in transgenic soybean plants. <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span> was targeted to the nucleus, where it bound to the W-box and acted as an activator of gene transcription. Moreover, we determined that <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span> physically interacted with <span class="gene">GmHDL56</span>, which improved resistance to P. sojae in transgenic soybean roots. <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span> and <span class="gene">GmHDL56</span> shared a common target <span class="gene">GmNPR1</span> which was induced by P. sojae. Overexpression and RNA interference analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmNPR1</span> enhanced resistance to P. sojae in transgenic soybean plants. Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including <span class="gene">GmPR1a</span>, <span class="gene">GmPR2</span>, <span class="gene">GmPR3</span>, <span class="gene">GmPR4</span>, <span class="gene">GmPR5a</span>, and <span class="gene">GmPR10</span>, in soybean plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmNPR1</span> transcripts. By contrast, the induction of PR genes was compromised in transgenic <span class="gene">GmNPR1</span>-RNAi lines. Taken together, these findings suggested that the interaction between <span class="gene">GmWRKY31</span> and <span class="gene">GmHDL56</span> enhances resistance to P. sojae by regulating defense-related gene expression in soybean.
