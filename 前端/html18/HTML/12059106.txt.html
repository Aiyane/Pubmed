				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Ethylene-responsive element-binding proteins (EREBPs) are members of a family of plant transcription factors. Conserved EREBP domains of these proteins bind to the GCC box, an ethylene-responsive promoter element found in many pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. Using degenerate primers to the EREBP domain from diverse plant species, an EREBP homolog was isolated from a soybean cDNA library. Gel mobility-shift assays revealed that the translation product of this cDNA bound specifically to GCC box sequences. We, therefore, named this gene Glycine max ethylene-responsive element-binding protein 1 (<span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span>), i.e., a gene coding for the first confirmed GCC box-binding protein of soybean. <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> mRNA abundance was analyzed by RNA blot hybridizations in soybean roots and shoots of cultivars Corsoy 79 and Hartwig, which are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). These analyses revealed that <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> is expressed in a root-preferential manner and that <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> mRNA abundance is changed after H. glycines infection. <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> mRNA abundance decreased in infected (susceptible) 'Corsoy 79' roots, whereas it increased in abundance in infected (resistant) 'Hartwig' roots. Furthermore, ethephon treatment repressed <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> mRNA accumulation in both cultivars, whereas wounding increased expression in both cultivars. These changes in mRNA steady-state levels suggest that <span class="gene">GmEREBP1</span> plays a role in soybean-H. glycines interactions.
