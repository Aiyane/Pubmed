				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors play important roles in many biological processes. In the present study, a bZIP gene, <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span>, was cloned from soybean and its biological function under abiotic stresses was studied. The transcription of <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> was induced by drought and high salt treatments. Among all of the organs analyzed, its expression was the highest in cotytledon and stems. <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> could weakly bind to the GCN4-like motif (GLM) (5'-GTGAGTCAT-3') in yeast one-hybrid assay. Compared with wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants, transgenic plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> showed reduced abscisic acid sensitivity and increased water loss rate. At the stage of germination, transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt treatment than wild-type plants. The expression of some abiotic stress-related genes, such as rd29B, DREB2A, and P5CS, were upregulated in the transgenic plants. These results indicated that <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> was an abiotic stress-related gene, and its overexpression could <span class="gene">increase the salt tolerance</span> of transgenic Arabidopsis plants during germination, yet no significant difference of tolerance to abiotic stresses was found between transgenic and wild type plants at the seedling stage.
