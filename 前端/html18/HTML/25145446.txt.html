						KEY MESSAGE: This study provides a foundation for further research on root genetic regulation and molecular breeding with emphasis on correlations among root traits to ensure robust root growth and well-developed root systems. A set of 447 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Jingdou23 (cultivar, female parent) and ZDD2315 (semi-wild, male parent) were used to analyze inheritance and detect QTLs related to root traits at the seedling stage using major gene plus polygene mixed inheritance analysis and composite interval mapping. The results showed that maximum root length (<span class="gene">MRL</span>) was controlled by three equivalent major genes, lateral root number (<span class="gene">LRN</span>) was controlled by two overlapping major genes, root weight (<span class="gene">RW</span>) and volume (<span class="gene">RV</span>) were controlled by four equivalent major genes. Hypocotyl length (<span class="gene">HL</span>) was controlled by four additive main genes, and hypocotyl weight (HW) was controlled by four additive and additive × additive epistatic, major genes; however, polygene effects were not detected in these traits. Shoot weight (<span class="gene">SW</span>) was controlled by multi-gene effects, but major gene effects were not detected. Twenty-four QTLs for <span class="gene">MRL</span>, <span class="gene">LRN</span>, <span class="gene">RW</span>, <span class="gene">RV</span>, <span class="gene">SW</span>, <span class="gene">HL</span>, HW were mapped on LG A1 (chromosome 5), LG A2 (chromosome 8), LG B1 (chromosome 11), LG B2 (chromosome 14), LG C2 (chromosome 6), <span class="gene">LG D1b</span> (chromosome 2), <span class="gene">LG F_1</span> (chromosome 13), <span class="gene">LG G</span> (chromosome 18), <span class="gene">LG H_1</span> (chromosome 12), <span class="gene">LG H_2</span> (chromosome 12), LG I (chromosome 20), LG K_2 (chromosome 9), <span class="gene">LG L</span> (chromosome 19), <span class="gene">LG M</span> (chromosome 7), <span class="gene">LG N</span> (chromosome 3), <span class="gene">LG O</span> (chromosome 10), separately. Root traits were shown to have complex genetic mechanisms at the seedling stage, <span class="gene">SW</span> was controlled by multi-gene effects, and the other six traits were controlled by major gene effects. It is concluded that correlations among root traits must be considered to improve the development of beneficial root traits.
