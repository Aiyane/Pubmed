				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Here, we aimed to clone and identify the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene related to the salt stress response in soybean. The full-length cDNA sequence of the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene was amplified in soybean using degenerate primers of Mesembrythmum crystallium. To understand the stress response, the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene was cloned and sequenced. Then, the expression vectors of the gene were constructed, and introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana through Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and the salt tolerance was analyzed in the transgenic plants. In addition, the expression patterns of <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene in soybean were analyzed. The expression was examined in different organs (roots, leaves, flower seeds, and stem) and under different stress conditions (drought, high salt, low temperature, salicylic acid, ethane, abscisic acid, and methyl jasmonate) by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed that the root, leaves, and stems exhibited high level of <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene expression, whereas there was no expression in the seeds. In addition, the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene expression was upregulated under all stress conditions. Overall, the results clearly indicate that <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> might be involved in multiple plant response pathways to the different environmental conditions. Furthermore transgenic plants exhibited <span class="gene">higher salt-tolerance</span> compared to wild type plants.
