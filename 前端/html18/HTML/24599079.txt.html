				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Brassinosteroids (BRs) constitute a group of steroidal phytohormones that contribute to a wide range of plant growth and development functions. The genetic modulation of BR receptor genes, which play major roles in the BR signaling pathway, can create semi-dwarf plants that have great advantages in crop production. In this study, <span class="gene">a brassinosteroid insensitive gene</span> homologous with AtBRI1 and other BRIs was isolated from Glycine max and designated as <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span>. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> shares a conserved kinase domain and 25 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are characteristic of a BR receptor for BR reception and reaction and bear a striking similarity in protein tertiary structure to AtBRI1. <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> transcripts were more abundant in soybean hypocotyls and could be upregulated in response to exogenous BR treatment. The transformation of <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> into the Arabidopsis dwarf mutant bri1-5 restored the phenotype, especially regarding pod size and plant height. Additionally, this complementation is a consequence of a restored BR signaling pathway demonstrated in the light/dark analysis, root inhibition assay and BR-response gene expression. Therefore, <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> functions as a BR receptor to alter BR-mediated signaling and is valuable for improving plant architecture and enhancing the yield of soybean.
