					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Rhythms produced by the endogenous circadian clock play a critical role in allowing plants to respond and adapt to the environment. While there is a well-established regulatory link between the circadian clock and responses to abiotic stress in model plants, little is known of the circadian system in crop species like soybean. This study examines how drought impacts diurnal oscillation of both drought responsive and circadian clock genes in soybean. Drought stress induced marked changes in gene expression of several circadian clock-like components, such as <span class="gene">LCL1</span>-, <span class="gene">GmELF4</span>- and <span class="gene">PRR</span>-like genes, which had <span class="gene">reduced expression in stressed plants</span>. The same conditions <span class="gene">produced a phase advance of expression</span> for the <span class="gene">GmTOC1</span>-like, <span class="gene">GmLUX</span>-like and <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">PRR</span>7</span>-like genes. Similarly, the rhythmic expression pattern of the soybean drought-responsive genes <span class="gene">DREB</span>-, <span class="gene">bZIP</span>-, <span class="gene">GOLS</span>-, <span class="gene">RAB18</span>- and <span class="gene">Remorin</span>-like <span class="gene">changed significantly after plant exposure to drought</span>. In silico analysis of promoter regions of these genes revealed the presence of cis-elements associated both with stress and circadian clock regulation. Furthermore, some soybean genes with upstream ABRE elements were responsive to abscisic acid treatment. Our results indicate that some connection between the drought response and the circadian clock may exist in soybean since (i) drought stress affects gene expression of circadian clock components and (ii) several stress responsive genes display diurnal oscillation in soybeans.
