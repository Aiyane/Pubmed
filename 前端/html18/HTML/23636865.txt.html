				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is a typical short-day crop, and its photoperiodic and gibberellin (GA) responses for the control of flowering are critical to seed yield. The <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> mRNA abundance in leaves was dramatically increased in short-days (SDs) compared to that in long-days in which it was consistently low at all time points from 0 to 6 days (days after transfer to SDs). <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was highly expressed in leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythm in SDs. Ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> in tobaccos caused photoperiod-insensitive early flowering by increasing NtCO mRNA levels. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> mRNA abundance was also increased by GAs. Transgenic <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> overexpressing (-ox) tobacco plants exhibited increased GA signaling-related phenotypes including flowering and plant height promotion. Furthermore, the hypocotyl elongation, early-flowering and longer internode phenotypes were largely accelerated by GA3 application in the <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span>-ox tobacco seedlings. Being consistent, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> resulted in significantly enhanced GA signaling (evidenced suppressed expression of NtGA20ox) both with and without GA treatments. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was a positive regulator of both photoperiod and GA-mediated flowering responses. In addition, <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span>-ox tobaccos were hypersensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination. Heat-inducible <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> also enhanced thermotolerance in transgenic <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span>-ox tobaccos during seed germination and growth. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> protein was localized in the nucleus. Analyses of a series of 5'-deletions of the <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> promoter suggested that several cis-acting elements, including P-BOX, TCA-motif and three HSE elements necessary to induce gene expression by GA, salicic acid and heat stress, were specifically localized in the <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> promoter region.
