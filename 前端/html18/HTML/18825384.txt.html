				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plants respond to cold stress by modifying the expression of a battery of cold-responsive genes. Using cDNA-AFLP techniques, <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> (G lycine m ax chilling-inducible) (accession no. EU699765) was isolated from the embryonic axis of a chilling-resistant cultivar of soybean seed imbibed at 4 degrees C for 24 h. The full-length <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> cDNA which consisted of a single open reading frame (ORF) encoded a putative polypeptide of 129 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed neither significant similarity of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> to known proteins, nor any conserved domains found. Soybean seed imbibed at 4 degrees C dramatically enhanced transcript level of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> after 1 h, and reached a maximum at 18 h, while the expression was only detected in the embryonic axis. <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> expression was strongly induced by treatment with ABA and PEG, but weakly by 250 mM NaCl which suggests that <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> is probably regulated by ABA-dependent signal transduction pathway during cold acclimation. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> in Arabidopsis under the control of CaMV35S promoter enhanced the tolerance to cold, drought and NaCl stresses. Therefore, <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> may play an important role in the adaptation of chilling-resistant soybean seed to chilling imbibition.
