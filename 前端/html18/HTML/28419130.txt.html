				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Drought is a major threat to global soybean production. The limited transformation potential and polyploid nature of soybean have hindered functional analysis of soybean genes. Previous research has implicated farnesylation in the plant's response to abscisic acid (ABA) and drought tolerance. We therefore used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to evaluate farnesyltransferase genes, <span class="gene">GmERA1A</span> and <span class="gene">GmERA1B</span> (<span class="gene">Glycine max Enhanced Response to ABA1-A and -B</span>), as potential targets for <span class="gene">increasing drought resistance</span> in soybean. Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV)-mediated GmERA1-down-regulated soybean leaves displayed an enhanced stomatal response to ABA and reduced water loss and wilting under dehydration conditions, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmERA1A</span> and <span class="gene">GmERA1B</span> negatively regulate ABA signaling in soybean guard cells. The findings provide evidence that the ALSV-VIGS system, which bypasses the need to generate transgenic plants, is a useful tool for analyzing gene function using only a single down-regulated leaf. Thus, the ALSV-VIGS system could constitute part of a next-generation molecular breeding pipeline to accelerate drought resistance breeding in soybean.
