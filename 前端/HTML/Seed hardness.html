				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Hardness</span> of cooked soybeans [Glycine max (L). Merr.] is an important attribute in food processing. We found one candidate gene, <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> to be associated with the <span class="trait">hardness</span> of cotyledons of cooked soybeans, based on a quantitative trait locus and fine-scale mapping analyses using a recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between two Japanese cultivars, "Natto-shoryu" and "Hyoukei-kuro 3". Analysis of the DNA sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> a pectin methylesterase gene homologue, revealed three patterns of mutations, two of which result in truncated proteins and one of which results in an amino acid substitution. The truncated proteins are presumed to lack the enzymatic activity of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> We classified 24 cultivars into four groups based on the sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> The texture analysis using the 22 cultivars grown in different locations indicated that protein truncation of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360</span> resulted in softer cotyledons of cooked soybeans, which was further confirmed by texture analysis performed using F2 populations of a cross between "Enrei" and "LD00-3309", and between "Satonohohoemi" and "Sakukei 98". A positive correlation between <span class="trait">hardness</span> and calcium content implies the possible effect of calcium binding to pectins on the <span class="trait">hardness</span> of cooked soybean cotyledons.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						For the development of healthful gluten-free soy bread acceptable to consumers, we evaluated the effects of various processing procedures for soy flour on bread quality, in terms of beany flavour and texture. We pretreated soy flour by both non-heating (raw:NS and germinated:GS) and heating (steamed:SS and roasted:RS) methods. In addition, to improve the loaf volume, we added 1% hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) to RS flour. Lipoxygenase activity was retained in the non-heat-treated flours (279 U/g for NS and 255 U/g for GS), but was significantly reduced in the heat-treated flours (106U/g for <span class="gene">SS</span> and 69 U/g for RS). Moreover, heat-treated flour had higher isoflavone and ferric reducing antioxidant power than had non-heat-treated flour. However, RS flour had the lowest moisture content and lowest L value. The <span class="gene">GS</span> bread had the highest specific loaf volume (3.53 cm(3)/g), followed by NS (2.96 cm(3)/g), RS (2.25c m(3)/g), and <span class="gene">SS</span> (1.81 cm(3)/g) bread. <span class="gene">GS</span> bread had the lowest <span class="trait">hardness</span> (1.53N), followed by NS (1.65 N), RS (2.00 N), and <span class="gene">SS</span> (3.75 N) bread. The addition of 1% HPMC to RS increased the loaf volume (2.44 cm(3)/g), but decreased the bread's <span class="trait">hardness</span> (1.80N). As to the sensory properties, the bread with heat-treated flour was perceived to have a less beany odour and taste than was the bread with non-heat-treated flour. However, the latter had a better appearance than the former. These results indicated that soy flour pretreatment could enhance the loaf volume and reduce the beany flavour of whole soy bread.

						In soybean, six independent loci ( <italic> I, T, R, Wp, W1, </italic> and <italic> O </italic> ) control the color and distribution of pigments ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ; <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr"> Palmer and Kilen, 1987 </xref> ; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr"> Gillman et al., 2011 </xref> ). The best characterized <italic> I </italic> locus (for <italic> inhibitor </italic> , ecoding chalcone synthase) inhibits the production and accumulation of anthocyanins and PAs in the epidermal layer of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ). An allelic series for the <italic> I </italic> gene is present in soybean, where the absence of pigmentation is controlled by the dominant allele at the <italic> I </italic> locus, whereas the homozygous recessive <italic> ii </italic> genotype produces a totally pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, and the alternate <italic> i <sup> i </sup> </italic> allele results in pigmentation of the hilum ( <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr"> Tuteja et al., 2004 </xref> ). Most cultivated soybean varieties are homozygous for the <italic> I </italic> gene, resulting in a yellow <span class="trait">seed</span> coat. To date, eight chalcone synthase genes have been identified in soybean, all expressed in <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (reviewed in <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr"> Mo&#x000ef;se et al., 2005 </xref> ). Chalcone synthase is the first enzyme of the branched pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ), and it plays a role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites functioning as UV protectants, phytoalexins, insect repellents, and symbiosis initiators in various plant tissues. Another locus, <italic> T </italic> , affects pubescence and hilum colors, and it induces <span class="trait">seed</span> coat cracking. It encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the formation of quercetin from kaempferol ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) and is responsible for the hydroxylation of the 3&#x02032;position of flavonoids, leading to the production of cyanidin pigments ( <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2003 </xref> ). The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> locus controls flower color and affects <span class="trait">seed</span> color only in an <italic> iRT </italic> background, where <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> and <italic> w1 </italic> alleles give imperfect black and buff <span class="trait">seed</span> coat colors, respectively. The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> allele encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase ( <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2007 </xref> ) and causes purple flower. The <italic> Wp </italic> locus was suggested to code for the flavanone 3-hydroxylase ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) based on microarray analysis ( <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2005 </xref> ), where the recessive <italic> wp </italic> allele resulted in change from black ( <italic> iRTWp </italic> ) to light grayish ( <italic> irtwp </italic> ) color. The <italic> O </italic> locus affects the color of brown <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <italic> irTO </italic> ) and has been suggested to code for ANR ( <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr"> Yang et al., 2010 </xref> ). Finally, the <italic> R </italic> locus controls the presence ( <italic> R </italic> ) or absence ( <italic> r </italic> ) of anthocyanins in black ( <italic> iRT </italic> ) or brown ( <italic> irT </italic> ) <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, respectively ( <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr"> Nagai, 1921 </xref> ). The up-regulation of anthocyanidin synthase genes suggests that the <italic> R </italic> locus codes for a regulatory factor ( <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr"> Kovinich et al., 2011 </xref> ). Comparably less is known about pigmentation in pea, especially in relation to the testa. Mendel&#x02019;s <italic> A </italic> gene, conferring pea flower color and testa pigmentation, has been recently identified as a bHLH TF, exerting thus pleiotropic effects on flower, leaf axils and testa pigmentation ( <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr"> Hellens et al., 2010 </xref> ). However, these traits can be genetically uncoupled, e.g., pea with colored flowers can have nearly non-pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (Sm&#x000fd;kal, unpublished). The <italic> b </italic> gene of pea was shown to encode a defective flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase, conferring pink flower color ( <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr"> Moreau et al., 2012 </xref> ). However, none of these two mutations result in alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy, since they have been identified in cultivated pea lines. Also in lupin, besides the hard-seeded gene <italic> Mollis </italic> , the blue flower and dark <span class="trait">seed</span> color gene <italic> Leucospermus </italic> ( <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr"> Clements et al., 2005 </xref> ) confers domestication trait. Although truly wild <italic> Vicia faba </italic> has not identified, a locus was found to be involved in <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy (i.e., <italic> doz </italic> ) linked to a locus controlling anthocyanin and pro-anthocyanidin synthesis (i.e., <italic> sp-v </italic> ; <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr"> Ramsay, 1997 </xref> ). Finally, in <italic> Trifolium subterraneum </italic> seeds, a relationship between color, phenolic content and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat impermeability was found ( <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr"> Slattery et al., 1982 </xref> ).

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effects of protein concentration, and heating temperature and time on the gelling properties of soybean beta-conglycinin (7S globulins) lacking the alpha or <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunit were compared with those of 7S containing all three subunits (alpha, alpha', and beta) to determine whether each subunit contributes equally. In most of the conditions, the relative order of gel <span class="trait">hardness</span> was alpha'-lacking &gt; 7S &gt; alpha-lacking. From Fourier transform infrared studies, the secondary structure change after heating was very similar among the three samples; thus, the secondary structural change is not the reason for the differences in gel <span class="trait">hardness.</span> By using scanning electron microscopy, we observed differences in strand thickness and the density of the gel network among the three samples. These differences correlated well with the differences in gel <span class="trait">hardness.</span>
