					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Hardness</span> of cooked soybeans [Glycine max (L). Merr.] is an important attribute in food processing. We found one candidate gene, <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> to be associated with the <span class="trait">hardness</span> of cotyledons of cooked soybeans, based on a quantitative trait locus and fine-scale mapping analyses using a recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between two Japanese cultivars, "Natto-shoryu" and "Hyoukei-kuro 3". Analysis of the DNA sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> a pectin methylesterase gene homologue, revealed three patterns of mutations, two of which result in truncated proteins and one of which results in an amino acid substitution. The truncated proteins are presumed to lack the enzymatic activity of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> We classified 24 cultivars into four groups based on the sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> The texture analysis using the 22 cultivars grown in different locations indicated that protein truncation of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360</span> resulted in softer cotyledons of cooked soybeans, which was further confirmed by texture analysis performed using F2 populations of a cross between "Enrei" and "LD00-3309", and between "Satonohohoemi" and "Sakukei 98". A positive correlation between <span class="trait">hardness</span> and calcium content implies the possible effect of calcium binding to pectins on the <span class="trait">hardness</span> of cooked soybean cotyledons.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						For the development of healthful gluten-free soy bread acceptable to consumers, we evaluated the effects of various processing procedures for soy flour on bread quality, in terms of beany flavour and texture. We pretreated soy flour by both non-heating (raw:NS and germinated:GS) and heating (steamed:SS and roasted:RS) methods. In addition, to improve the loaf volume, we added 1% hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) to RS flour. Lipoxygenase activity was retained in the non-heat-treated flours (279 U/g for NS and 255 U/g for GS), but was significantly reduced in the heat-treated flours (106U/g for <span class="gene">SS</span> and 69 U/g for RS). Moreover, heat-treated flour had higher isoflavone and ferric reducing antioxidant power than had non-heat-treated flour. However, RS flour had the lowest moisture content and lowest L value. The <span class="gene">GS</span> bread had the highest specific loaf volume (3.53 cm(3)/g), followed by NS (2.96 cm(3)/g), RS (2.25c m(3)/g), and <span class="gene">SS</span> (1.81 cm(3)/g) bread. <span class="gene">GS</span> bread had the lowest <span class="trait">hardness</span> (1.53N), followed by NS (1.65 N), RS (2.00 N), and <span class="gene">SS</span> (3.75 N) bread. The addition of 1% HPMC to RS increased the loaf volume (2.44 cm(3)/g), but decreased the bread's <span class="trait">hardness</span> (1.80N). As to the sensory properties, the bread with heat-treated flour was perceived to have a less beany odour and taste than was the bread with non-heat-treated flour. However, the latter had a better appearance than the former. These results indicated that soy flour pretreatment could enhance the loaf volume and reduce the beany flavour of whole soy bread.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objective was to develop a cereal <span class="gene">bar</span> product rich in isoflavones and soy protein to be used in diets for controlling dyslipidaemia. A soy snack <span class="gene">bar</span> with 39.88 g/100 g dietary fibre, 34.25 g/100 g protein, 100.39 mg/100 g isoflavones and 245.47 kcal/100 g was produced. The shelf life of the product was tested over a period of 6 months. The <span class="trait">hardness,</span> water activity and darkness of the snack bars increased with storage time. Clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the soy snack <span class="gene">bar</span> on the lipid profiles of 22 dyslipidaemic subjects for a period of 45 days. There was a decrease in levels of triglycerides (TGs) (- 20%) and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (+8%) comparing with baseline values. Therefore, relatively high intakes of soy protein and isoflavones in moderately hypercholesterolaemic subjects (&gt;200 mg/dl) may have a moderately beneficial effect on plasma lipid profiles, as TG and HDL-c levels, without additional diet restrictions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Health and wellness is a trend observed throughout ready-to-eat cereals, cereal health bars. Therefore, the main objectives of this research were to produce a low cost, acceptable, nutritious and healthy wheat- and soy-based <span class="gene">bar</span> under no-bake conditions. Also, the physical, chemical, microbial, acceptability and the nutritional value of this product were studied. Six different bars were produced: a wheat <span class="gene">bar</span> (WB), a wheat <span class="gene">bar</span> with coating (WBC), a wheat and soy <span class="gene">bar</span> with coating (WSBC), a soy <span class="gene">bar</span> with coating (SBC), a wheat <span class="gene">bar</span> with 3% glycerin (WB3%), and a wheat <span class="gene">bar</span> with 6% glycerine (WB6%). RESULTS: WB and WBC had the highest water activities while WSBC had the lowest. The three bars with coating had higher L and lower b values, which indicates that they were lighter and not as highly yellow coloured as the wheat samples. WSBC had the lowest value for <span class="trait">hardness</span> while the SBC and WBC had the highest. SBC received the highest scores for overall acceptability, appearance, sweetness, flavour and texture while WSBC received the second highest score in all categories. CONCLUSION: It appears that consumers prefer the soy varieties to the wheat bars. These types of bars can aid in feeding the general population, which is becoming increasingly concerned with nutrition and convenience.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Studies analyzing cereal bars have reported on consumer characteristics and preferences in sensory analyses and on their market growth, however little has been published on their physicochemical data and texture properties. Thus the objective of this research was to provide information about the storage of a cereal <span class="gene">bar</span> formulation with high protein and vitamin levels based on soy protein and wheat germ, packaged in 3 different films (A: PET/PEBD; B: PETmet/PEBD; C: PET/PEBD/AL/PEBD), during 6 months under environmental conditions of temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C) and relative humidity (56%). The moisture content, water activity, pH and total acidity of the cereal bars were determined. The textural measurements accompanied during storage were breaking strength, <span class="trait">hardness</span> and cohesiveness. The cereal bars presented variations in water activity (Aw), moisture content and total acidity during storage. The moisture content of the bars tended to increase, which led to a significant (p = 0.05) influence on the texture characteristics of breaking strength and <span class="trait">hardness,</span> in the different packaging films tested. The increase in the values for breaking strength (A: 4756,5N; B: 5093,0N; C: 5575,6N) at 45 days of storage was attributed to a possible crystallization of the agglutinating syrup used for the bars. The textured soy protein used in the formulation could also have contributed to this fact due to its hygroscopic character, also interfering in the decrease in the cohesiveness measurements (deformation) with time. The effect of the different barrier properties of the packaging films tested was significant (p &lt; 0.05) in the stability of the cereal bars during storage.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effects of protein concentration, and heating temperature and time on the gelling properties of soybean beta-conglycinin (7S globulins) lacking the alpha or <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunit were compared with those of 7S containing all three subunits (alpha, alpha', and beta) to determine whether each subunit contributes equally. In most of the conditions, the relative order of gel <span class="trait">hardness</span> was alpha'-lacking &gt; 7S &gt; alpha-lacking. From Fourier transform infrared studies, the secondary structure change after heating was very similar among the three samples; thus, the secondary structural change is not the reason for the differences in gel <span class="trait">hardness.</span> By using scanning electron microscopy, we observed differences in strand thickness and the density of the gel network among the three samples. These differences correlated well with the differences in gel <span class="trait">hardness.</span>

						The anatomical structure of the testa is rather homogenous except for the chalazal region ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B </xref> </bold> ). The hilum is a distinctly oval or round abscission scar in the chalazal <span class="trait">seed</span> region, a relic of former connection of the <span class="trait">seed</span> to the maternal plant via the funiculus. There is another residual layer of palisade cells of funicular origin termed counter-palisade, which are part of the hilar scar ( <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr"> Lackey, 1981 </xref> ). There is a central fissure (hilar groove) in the hilum palisade layer overlaying the tracheid <span class="gene">bar</span> ( <bold> Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1B,C </xref> </bold> ) from the micropyle to the ovular bundle on the other side. This strip of large, pitted and lignified tracheids is commonly found in legumes although there is some variability in structure and ovular bundle position (for more detail see <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr"> Lersten, 1982 </xref> ). A role for the hilar groove as a hygroscopically activated valve was suggested ( <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr"> Hyde, 1954 </xref> ; <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr"> Lush and Evans, 1980 </xref> ). The fissure in the hilum opens when relative humidity is low permitting the <span class="trait">seed</span> to dry out whereas high relative humidity causes the fissure to close preventing the absorption of moisture.

						In soybean, six independent loci ( <italic> I, T, R, Wp, W1, </italic> and <italic> O </italic> ) control the color and distribution of pigments ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ; <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr"> Palmer and Kilen, 1987 </xref> ; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr"> Gillman et al., 2011 </xref> ). The best characterized <italic> I </italic> locus (for <italic> inhibitor </italic> , ecoding chalcone synthase) inhibits the production and accumulation of anthocyanins and PAs in the epidermal layer of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ). An allelic series for the <italic> I </italic> gene is present in soybean, where the absence of pigmentation is controlled by the dominant allele at the <italic> I </italic> locus, whereas the homozygous recessive <italic> ii </italic> genotype produces a totally pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, and the alternate <italic> i <sup> i </sup> </italic> allele results in pigmentation of the hilum ( <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr"> Tuteja et al., 2004 </xref> ). Most cultivated soybean varieties are homozygous for the <italic> I </italic> gene, resulting in a yellow <span class="trait">seed</span> coat. To date, eight chalcone synthase genes have been identified in soybean, all expressed in <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (reviewed in <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr"> Mo&#x000ef;se et al., 2005 </xref> ). Chalcone synthase is the first enzyme of the branched pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ), and it plays a role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites functioning as UV protectants, phytoalexins, insect repellents, and symbiosis initiators in various plant tissues. Another locus, <italic> T </italic> , affects pubescence and hilum colors, and it induces <span class="trait">seed</span> coat cracking. It encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the formation of quercetin from kaempferol ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) and is responsible for the hydroxylation of the 3&#x02032;position of flavonoids, leading to the production of cyanidin pigments ( <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2003 </xref> ). The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> locus controls flower color and affects <span class="trait">seed</span> color only in an <italic> iRT </italic> background, where <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">w1</span> </italic> alleles give imperfect black and buff <span class="trait">seed</span> coat colors, respectively. The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> allele encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase ( <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2007 </xref> ) and causes purple flower. The <italic> Wp </italic> locus was suggested to code for the flavanone 3-hydroxylase ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) based on microarray analysis ( <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2005 </xref> ), where the recessive <italic> wp </italic> allele resulted in change from black ( <italic> iRTWp </italic> ) to light grayish ( <italic> irtwp </italic> ) color. The <italic> O </italic> locus affects the color of brown <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <italic> irTO </italic> ) and has been suggested to code for ANR ( <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr"> Yang et al., 2010 </xref> ). Finally, the <italic> R </italic> locus controls the presence ( <italic> R </italic> ) or absence ( <italic> r </italic> ) of anthocyanins in black ( <italic> iRT </italic> ) or brown ( <italic> irT </italic> ) <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, respectively ( <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr"> Nagai, 1921 </xref> ). The up-regulation of anthocyanidin synthase genes suggests that the <italic> R </italic> locus codes for a regulatory factor ( <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr"> Kovinich et al., 2011 </xref> ). Comparably less is known about pigmentation in pea, especially in relation to the testa. Mendel&#x02019;s <italic> A </italic> gene, conferring pea flower color and testa pigmentation, has been recently identified as a bHLH TF, exerting thus pleiotropic effects on flower, leaf axils and testa pigmentation ( <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr"> Hellens et al., 2010 </xref> ). However, these traits can be genetically uncoupled, e.g., pea with colored flowers can have nearly non-pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (Sm&#x000fd;kal, unpublished). The <italic> b </italic> gene of pea was shown to encode a defective flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase, conferring pink flower color ( <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr"> Moreau et al., 2012 </xref> ). However, none of these two mutations result in alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy, since they have been identified in cultivated pea lines. Also in lupin, besides the hard-seeded gene <italic> Mollis </italic> , the blue flower and dark <span class="trait">seed</span> color gene <italic> Leucospermus </italic> ( <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr"> Clements et al., 2005 </xref> ) confers domestication trait. Although truly wild <italic> Vicia faba </italic> has not identified, a locus was found to be involved in <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy (i.e., <italic> doz </italic> ) linked to a locus controlling anthocyanin and pro-anthocyanidin synthesis (i.e., <italic> sp-v </italic> ; <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr"> Ramsay, 1997 </xref> ). Finally, in <italic> Trifolium subterraneum </italic> seeds, a relationship between color, phenolic content and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat impermeability was found ( <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr"> Slattery et al., 1982 </xref> ).

						The site of water entry into the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat is still a matter of debate ( <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr"> Meyer et al., 2007 </xref> ; <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr"> Ranathunge et al., 2010 </xref> ). Various explanations were proposed to account for the different permeability of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coats to water in hard and soft seeds including tightly bound palisade cells ( <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr"> Corner, 1951 </xref> ; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> Ballard, 1973 </xref> ), thickened <span class="trait">seed</span> coat tissues ( <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr"> Wyatt, 1977 </xref> ; <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr"> Miao et al., 2001 </xref> ), lack of pits ( <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr"> Chachalis and Smith, 2001 </xref> ), presence of endocarp deposits ( <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr"> Yaklich et al., 1986 </xref> ), dark color ( <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr"> Wyatt, 1977 </xref> ), closed hilum and/or micropyle ( <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr"> Hyde, 1954 </xref> ; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> Ballard, 1973 </xref> ; <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr"> Rolston, 1978 </xref> ; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr"> Hu et al., 2009 </xref> ), modifications of the outer tangential walls of palisade cells ( <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr"> Werker et al., 1979 </xref> ), a prominent light line of the palisade cells ( <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr"> Harris, 1984 </xref> , <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr"> 1987 </xref> ), presence of water gaps in the lens ( <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr"> Dell, 1980 </xref> ; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr"> Hanna, 1984 </xref> ; <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr"> Serrato Valenti et al., 1986 </xref> , <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> , <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr"> 1993 </xref> ; <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr"> Serrato-Valenti et al., 1995 </xref> ; <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr"> Van Staden et al., 1989 </xref> ; <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr"> Shen-Miller et al., 1995 </xref> ; <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr"> Morrison et al., 1998 </xref> ; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> Baskin et al., 2000 </xref> ; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr"> Burrows et al., 2009 </xref> ; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr"> Hu et al., 2009 </xref> ), as well as cracks in the cuticle of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr"> Morrison et al., 1998 </xref> ; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr"> Hu et al., 2009 </xref> ). In some legume species, such as <italic> Vigna </italic> , <italic> Robinia, Acacia </italic> , and many tropical and sub-tropical legume species ( <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr"> Karaki et al., 2012 </xref> ), water enters the <span class="trait">seed</span> a specialized structures such as the hilar slit and water <span class="gene">gap</span> (e.g., strophiole or lens; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr"> Gopinathan and Babu, 1985 </xref> ; <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr"> Kikuchi et al., 2006 </xref> ) opens. The morphological characteristics of these water gaps can vary between species. It is thought that water <span class="gene">gap</span> structures act as an environmental sensor to fine-tune germination to coincide with an environment that provides the best chance for seedling survival and ecosystem colonization. Water gaps are usually associated with areas of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat where natural openings in the ovule occurred during the <span class="trait">seed</span> development such as the hilum, micropyle, and chalaza. Although the soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> coat composition and structure are modified at the hilum and micropyle areas, these are thought not to contribute to the initial uptake of water ( <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr"> Ma et al., 2004 </xref> ). Instead, in soybeans, water mainly enters through small cracks in the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat to reach the embryo ( <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr"> Chachalis and Smith, 2000 </xref> ). There is some controversy on this issue, since other studies have suggested water uptake through the hilum ( <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr"> McDonald et al., 1988 </xref> ). In a related Phaseoleae tribe, the hilum, micropyle and lens have been proposed to be water entrance points for example, in <italic> Phaseolus lunatus </italic> ( <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr"> Korban et al., 1981 </xref> ) and <italic> Phaseolus vulgaris </italic> ( <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> Agbo et al., 1987 </xref> ).
