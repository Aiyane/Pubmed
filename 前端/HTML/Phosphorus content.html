					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved P efficiency in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and P <span class="trait">content,</span> respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P efficiency could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

						KEY MESSAGE: <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> , a novel plant <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene in soybean, has phytase activity. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> can enhance Arabidopsis growth when phytate is the sole P source in culture. <span class="trait">Phosphorus</span> (P) is an important macronutrient for plant growth and development. However, most of the total P in soils is fixed into organic phosphate (Po). Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) can hydrolyze Po in the soil to liberate inorganic phosphate and enhance plant P utilization. We isolated a novel <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene, <span class="gene">GmPAP4,</span> from soybean (Glycine max). It had an open reading frame of 1,329 bp, encoding 442 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment and phylogenetics analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was similar to other plant PAPs with large molecular masses. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the induced expression of <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was greater in P-efficient genotype Zhonghuang15 (ZH15) than in P-inefficient genotype Niumaohuang (NMH) during the periods of flowering (28-35 days post phytate stress; DPP) and pod formation (49-63 DPP). Moreover, peak expression, at 63 DPP, was about 3-fold higher in 'ZH15' than in 'NMH'. Sub-cellular localization showed that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> might be on plasma membrane or in cytoplasm. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> in Arabidopsis resulted in significant rises in P acquisition and utilization compared with the wild-type (WT). Under phytate condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed increases of approximately 132.7 % in dry weight and 162.6 % in shoot P <span class="trait">content</span> compared with the WT. Furthermore, when phytate was added as the sole P source in cultures, the activity of acid phosphatase was significantly higher in transgenic plants. Therefore, <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> is a novel <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene that functions in plant's utilization of organic phosphate especially under phytate condition.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nodulation is an essential process for biological nitrogen (N2) fixation in legumes, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, a β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> was found to be critical for soybean (Glycine max) nodulation. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was preferentially expressed at the early stage of nodule development. β-Glucuronidase staining further showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was mainly localized to the nodule vascular trace and nodule vascular bundles, as well as nodule cortical and parenchyma cells, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> might be involved in cell wall modification and extension during nodule formation and development. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> dramatically modified soybean root architecture, increasing the size and number of cortical cells in the root meristematic and elongation zones and expanding root hair density and size of the root hair zone. Confocal microscopy with green fluorescent protein-labeled rhizobium USDA110 cells showed that the infection events were significantly enhanced in the <span class="gene">GmEXPB2-overexpressing</span> lines. Moreover, nodule primordium development was earlier in overexpressing lines compared with wild-type plants. Thereby, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in either transgenic soybean hairy roots or whole plants resulted in increased nodule number, nodule mass, and nitrogenase activity and thus elevated plant N and <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> <span class="trait">content</span> as well as biomass. In contrast, suppression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in soybean transgenic composite plants led to smaller infected cells and thus reduced number of big nodules, nodule mass, and nitrogenase activity, thereby inhibiting soybean growth. Taken together, we conclude that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> critically affects soybean nodulation through modifying root architecture and promoting nodule formation and development and subsequently impacts biological N2 fixation and growth of soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A transgenic approach was used to alter soybean seed phytate <span class="trait">content</span> by expressing a soybean phytase gene <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> during seed development to degrade accumulating phytic acid (IP6). An expression vector containing the soybean phytase cDNA controlled by the seed-specific beta-conglycinin promoter (alpha'-subunit) was used to transform embryogenic soybean cultures. Plants from four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for transgene integration and seed IP6 levels. The reduction in IP6 levels in transgenic seeds compared to control 'Jack' soybeans ranged from 12.6 to 24.8 as determined by HPLC. A low copy transformant was propagated to the T4 generation and examined in more detail for phytase expression and enzyme activity during seed development. Expression of phytase mRNA and phytase activity increased during seed development, consistent with the use of an embryo-specific promoter. Ectopic phytase expression during seed development offers potential as an effective strategy for reducing phytate <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seed.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A decrease in dietary P, especially in finishing broilers (21 to 38 d old), is a crucial issue in poultry production from an environmental and economic point of view. Nevertheless, P must be considered together with other dietary components such as Ca and microbial phytase. Different corn and soybean meal-based diets varying in Ca [low (LCa) 0.37, medium (MCa) 0.57, and high (HCa) 0.77%], and nonphytate P [nPP; low (LnPP) 0.18 and high (HnPP) 0.32%] <span class="trait">content</span> were tested with and without microbial phytase [0 or 500 phytase units (FTU)/kg]. Feed intake, BW gain, bone mineralization, and mineral retention were examined in 144 Ross <span class="gene">PM3</span> broilers (22 to 38 d old) reared in individual cages. Growth performance was not significantly affected by the treatments. Nevertheless, a numerical decrease of ADG and ADFI was observed in HCa-LnPP and LCa-HnPP associated with an increase of feed conversion ratio. Decreased dietary Ca reduced tibia ash <span class="trait">content</span> (Ca, linear: P &lt; 0.001; quadratic: P = 0.034) and tibia ash weight for the highest level of nPP (Ca × nPP; P = 0.035). In parallel, increasing dietary Ca reduced the flow of retained P (P = 0.022) but also tibia ash weight in LnPP diets (Ca × nPP; P = 0.035). The responses of the animals in terms of tibia ash <span class="trait">content</span> and P retention were improved by the addition of microbial phytase especially for the lowest P diets (nPP × phytase, P = 0.021 and P = 0.009; respectively). Phytase increased dry tibia weight, bone breaking strength, and tibia diameter in broilers fed the highest Ca diets (Ca × phytase; P &lt; 0.05). We conclude that is possible to decrease P levels in finishing broilers, if the Ca <span class="trait">content</span> is appropriate. Nevertheless, decreasing the dietary P and Ca cannot allow a maximization of bone mineralization, but the optimal threshold remains to be determined.

						Phytase B, a product of Aspergillus niger <span class="gene">phyB</span> gene expressed in Trichoderma reesei, which increased myo-inositol concentrations in 20 mM sodium phytate solution 7.5-fold during 120-min incubation, a combination of phytase B with 6-phytase A, and pure myo-inositol were tested as feed supplements in Bovans Brown laying hens. In the 2-factorial experiment (2×5), birds from wk 50 to 62 were fed 2 basal diets, corn-soybean (CSM) or wheat-soybean (WSM), using 12 one-hen cages per treatment. For both basal diets, the dietary treatments included negative control (0.08% nonphytate P in CSM, 0.13% nonphytate P in WSM; NC); internal control groups, NC+0.04% nonphytate P from monocalcium phosphate, MCP (IC); NC+0.1% of myo-inositol (Inos), NC+phytase B at 1,300 units of phytase B-acid phosphatase activity (AcPU)/kg (PhyB), NC+phytase B at 1,300 AcPU/kg+6-phytase A at 300 FTU/kg (PhyA+B). Feed intake, laying performance, and eggshell quality were determined. The total lipid and cholesterol contents as well as fatty acid profile were assessed in egg yolks collected from hens fed CSM diets, as was fatty acid profile. The hens fed the WSM diet consumed significantly more feed, laid a higher mass of eggs daily with higher mean weights, and had a higher hen-day egg production than the birds receiving the CSM diets. Similarly, higher values for yolk weights, shell weights, shell thickness, shell density, and breaking strengths were determined in the eggs laid by the hens fed the WSM diets. In hens fed either the CSM diets with phytase B alone, or in combination with 6-phytase A, enhanced feed intakes, egg mass, and hen-day egg production were recorded. Phytases also enhanced the eggshell quality parameters in the hens fed both variants of the diets. Phytase B alone, or in combination with 6-phytase A, reduced the total lipid and cholesterol concentrations in egg yolks collected from the hens fed the CSM diets, whereas the combination of both phytases improved the n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio. In the CSM diets, the supplemental myo-inositol suppressed feed intakes, reduced egg production, had no effect on eggshell quality and reduced the deposition of eicosanoid fatty acids in yolks. When comparing the effects of feeding MCP, myo-inositol, and phytases on the nutritional quality of the eggs laid by the hens fed phosphorus-deficient CSM diets, it seems that the enhancements in nutritional quality cannot be attributed solely to higher <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> level or higher concentrations of myo-inositol.

						Excessive fertilization with organic and/or inorganic P amendments to cropland increases the potential risk of P loss to surface waters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil test P level, source, and application method of P amendments on P in runoff following soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The treatments consisted of two rates of swine (Sus scrofa domestica) liquid manure surface-applied and injected, 54 kg P ha(-1) triple superphosphate (TSP) surface-applied and incorporated, and a control with and without chisel-plowing. Rainfall simulations were conducted one month (1MO) and six months (6MO) after P amendment application for 2 yr. Soil injection of swine manure compared with surface application resulted in runoff P concentration decreases of 93, 82, and 94%, and P load decreases of 99, 94, and 99% for dissolved reactive <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (DRP), total <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (TP), and algal-available <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (AAP), respectively. Incorporation of TSP also reduced P concentration in runoff significantly. Runoff P concentration and load from incorporated amendments did not differ from the control. Factors most strongly related to P in runoff from the incorporated treatments included Bray <span class="gene">P1</span> soil extraction value for DRP concentration, and Bray <span class="gene">P1</span> and sediment <span class="trait">content</span> in runoff for AAP and TP concentration and load. Injecting manure and chisel-plowing inorganic fertilizer reduced runoff P losses, decreased runoff volumes, and increased the time to runoff, thus minimizing the potential risk of surface water contamination. After incorporating the P amendments, controlling erosion is the main target to minimize TP losses from agricultural soils.

						Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the major storage form of <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> in plant seeds. During germination, stored reserves are used as a source of nutrients by the plant seedling. Phytic acid is degraded by the activity of phytases to <span class="trait">yield</span> inositol and free phosphate. Due to the lack of phytases in the non-ruminant digestive tract, monogastric animals cannot utilize dietary phytic acid and it is excreted into manure. High phytic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in manure results in elevated <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> levels in soil and water and accompanying environmental concerns. The use of phytases to degrade seed phytic acid has potential for reducing the negative environmental impact of livestock production. A phytase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cotyledons of germinated soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.). Peptide sequence data generated from the purified enzyme facilitated the cloning of the phytase sequence <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> employing a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The introduction of <span class="gene">GmPhy</span> into soybean tissue culture resulted in increased phytase activity in transformed cells, which confirmed the identity of the phytase gene. It is surprising that the soybean phytase was unrelated to previously characterized microbial or maize (Zea mays) phytases, which were classified as histidine acid phosphatases. The soybean phytase sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity to purple acid phosphatases, a class of metallophosphoesterases.

						Ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was substituted for 0, 50 and 100% of the P supplied by defluorinated rock phosphate (DRP) in corn-soybean meal diets for growing rats and growing-finishing (G-F) pigs. The diets were formulated to contain 10% protein, .75% Ca and .60% P. Two-thirds of the P in the control diet was supplied by DRP. Replacement of 50 or 100% of the DRP with <span class="gene">APP</span> increased the dietary N by 7.25 and 14.5%, respectively. To evaluate nonprotein N (NPN) utilization, we used ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) to provide a level of N equivalent to that supplied by <span class="gene">APP</span> when it replaced 100% of the P supplied by DRP. These four treatments were repeated with supplementation of limiting amino acids (L-lysine, L-tryptophan and DL-methionine. Daily feed intake, rate of gain and feed:gain (F:G) of rats and G-F pigs were not influenced (P greater than .05) by the substitution of <span class="gene">APP</span> for DRP as a P source in corn-soybean meal diets with or without supplemental amino acids. F:G was improved (P less than .05) by the addition of limiting amino acids to diets for pigs, and a similar trend occurred in rats. The addition of NH4Cl to the 10% protein diets as a source of NPN resulted in no observable benefit for growing rats or G-F pigs. Percentages of ham and loin, percentages of bone ash and P <span class="trait">content</span> of the bone ash in pigs were not influenced by the dietary treatments.

						Reduction of phytic acid in soybean seeds has the potential to improve the nutritional value of soybean meal and lessen <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> pollution in large scale animal farming. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of two new low phytic acid (LPA) mutations on seed quality and nutritional traits. Multilocation/season comparative analyses showed that the two mutations did not affect the concentration of crude protein, any of the individual amino acids, crude oil, and individual saturated fatty acids. Among other traits, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW75-1</span> had consistently higher sucrose contents (+47.4-86.1%) and lower raffinose contents (-74.2 to -84.3%) than those of wild type (WT) parent Taiwan 75; <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had higher total isoflavone contents (3038.8-4305.4 microg/g) than its parent Zhechun # 3 (1583.6-2644.9 microg/g) in all environments. Further tests of homozygous F(3) progenies of the cross <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> x Wuxing # 4 (WT variety) showed that LPA lines had a mean <span class="trait">content</span> of total isoflavone significantly higher than WT lines. This study demonstrated that two LPA mutant genes have no negative effects on seed quality and nutritional traits; they instead have the potential to improve a few other properties. Therefore, these two mutant genes are valuable genetic resources for breeding high quality soybean varieties.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A total of 215 rhizobial strains were isolated and analyzed with 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S intergenic spacer, housekeeping genes atpD, recA, and glnII, and symbiotic genes <span class="gene">nifH</span> and <span class="gene">nodC</span> to understand the genetic diversity of soybean rhizobia in Hebei province, China. All the strains except one were symbiotic bacteria classified into nine genospecies in the genera of Bradyrhizobium and Sinorhizobium. Surveys on the distribution of these rhizobia in different regions showed that Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii strains were found only in neutral to slightly alkaline soils whereas Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, Bradyrhizobium liaoningense-related strains and strains of five Sinorhizobium genospecies were found in alkaline-saline soils. Correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses on the relationship of rhizobial distribution and their soil characteristics reveal that high soil pH, electrical conductivity, and potassium <span class="trait">content</span> favor distribution of the B. yuanmingense and the five Sinorhizobium species but inhibit B. japonicum and B. elkanii. High contents of available <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> and organic matters benefit Sinorhizobium fredii and B. liaoningense-related strains and inhibit the others groups mentioned above. The symbiotic gene (nifH and nodC) lineages among B. elkanii, B. japonicum, B. yuanmingense, and Sinorhizobium spp. were observed in the strains, signifying that vertical gene transfer was the main mechanism to maintain these genes in the soybean rhizobia. However, lateral transfer of symbiotic genes commonly in Sinorhizobium spp. and rarely in Bradyrhizobium spp. was also detected. These results showed the genetic diversity, the biogeography, and the soil determinant factors of soybean rhizobia in Hebei province of China.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is important to the nutritional quality of soybean meal. Organic <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) in PA is indigestible in humans and non-ruminant animals, which affects nutrition and causes P pollution of ground water from animal wastes. Two novel soybean [(Glycine max L. (Merr.)] low phytic acid (lpa) mutations were isolated and characterized. <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a phytic acid P (PA-P) reduction of 66.6% and a sixfold increase in inorganic P (Pi), and <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had a PA-P reduction of 46.3% and a 1.4-fold increase in Pi, compared with their respective non-mutant progenitor lines. The reduction of PA-P and increase of Pi in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> were molar equivalent; the decrease of PA-P in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> however, was accompanied by the increase of both Pi and lower inositol phosphates. In both mutant lines, the total P <span class="trait">content</span> remained similar to their wild type parents. The two lpa mutations were both inherited in a single recessive gene model but were non-allelic. Sequence data and progeny analysis indicate that <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> lpa mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in the soybean D: -myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1 EC 5.5.1.4) gene 1 (MIPS1). The lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was mapped on LG B2, closely linked with microsatellite loci Satt416 and Satt168, at genetic distances of approximately 4.63 and approximately 9.25 cM, respectively. Thus this mutation probably represents a novel soybean lpa locus. The seed emergence rate of <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was similar to its progenitor line and was not affected by seed source and its lpa mutation. However, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a significantly reduced field emergence when seeds were produced in a subtropic environment. Field tests of the mutants and their progenies further demonstrated that the lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> does not negatively affect plant <span class="trait">yield</span> traits. These results will advance understanding of the genetic, biochemical and molecular control of PA synthesis in soybean. The novel lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> together with linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, will be of value for breeding productive lpa soybeans, with meal high in digestible Pi eventually to improve animal nutrition and lessen environmental pollution.

						Although, compost is the store house of different plant nutrients, there is a concern for low amount of major nutrients especially nitrogen <span class="trait">content</span> in prepared compost. The present study deals with preparation of compost by using agricultural wastes with struvite (MgNH4PO4·6H2O) along with termite mound. Among four composting mixtures, 50kg termite mound and 2.5kg struvite with crop residues (stover of ground nut: 361.65kg; soybean: 354.59kg; potato: 357.67kg and mustard: 373.19kg) and cow dung (84.90kg) formed a good quality compost within 70days of composting having nitrogen, <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> and potassium as 21.59, 3.98 and 34.6gkg(-1), respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences among the composts. The four composts formed two (pit 1, <span class="gene">pit</span> 2 and <span class="gene">pit</span> 3, <span class="gene">pit</span> 4) different groups. Two principal components expressed more than 97% of the total variability. Hierarchical cluster analysis resulted two homogeneous groups of composts.

						A potential mechanism to enhance utilization of sparingly soluble forms of <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) is the root secretion of malate, which is mainly mediated by the ALMT gene family in plants. In this study, a total of 34 <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> genes were identified in the soybean genome. Expression patterns diverged considerably among <span class="gene">GmALMTs</span> in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in leaves, roots and flowers, with expression altered by P availability in 26 of the 34 <span class="gene">GmALMTs.</span> One root-specific <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean P nutrition. Analysis of <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots. Furthermore, both growth and P <span class="trait">content</span> of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external P source. Taken together, these results indicate that members of the soybean <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> gene family exhibit diverse responses to Pi starvation. One member of this family, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> might contribute to soybean P efficiency by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble P sources under P limited conditions.

						Plant root cell walls are dynamic systems that serve as the first plant compartment responsive to soil conditions, such as <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) deficiency. To date, evidence for the regulation of root cell wall proteins (CWPs) by P deficiency remains sparse. In order to gain a better understanding of the roles played by CWPs in the roots of soybean (Glycine max) in adaptation to P deficiency, we conducted an iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) proteomic analysis. A total of 53 CWPs with differential accumulation in response to P deficiency were identified. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis correlated the accumulation of 21 of the 27 up-regulated proteins, and eight of the 26 down-regulated proteins with corresponding gene expression patterns in response to P deficiency. One up-regulated CWP, purple acid phosphatase 1-like <span class="gene">(GmPAP1-like),</span> was functionally characterized. Phaseolus vulgaris transgenic hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmPAP1-like</span> displayed an increase in root-associated acid phosphatase activity. In addition, relative growth and P <span class="trait">content</span> were significantly enhanced in <span class="gene">GmPAP1-like</span> overexpressing lines compared to control lines when deoxy-ribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) was applied as the sole external P source. Taken together, the results suggest that the modulation of CWPs may regulate complex changes in the root system in response to P deficiency, and that the cell wall-localized <span class="gene">GmPAP1-like</span> protein is involved in extracellular dNTP utilization in soybean.

						Non-imaging spectroscopy can quantify light intensity across hundreds or thousands of distinct spectral bands but does not provide data on spatial variation. These bands are commonly divided into the visible (VIS, 400&#x02013;700 nm), near infrared (NIR, 700&#x02013;1,100 nm) and short wave infrared (SWIR, 1,100&#x02013;2,500 nm) spectral regions. Non-imaging spectroscopy is commonly used as a remote, non-destructive method for rapid analysis of many properties for both fresh leaves and processed plant materials. VIS is the region where photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls, carotenoids, and xanthophyll absorb strongly; whereas reflection in <span class="gene">NIR</span> is dominated by structural reflection of turgid plant cells. These two regions combined are often employed to probe the properties of living plant leaves such as pigment concentrations, water <span class="trait">content,</span> and light use efficiencies (Penuelas and Filella, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"> 1998 </xref> ; Sims and Gamon, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr"> 2002 </xref> ; Blackburn, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> 2007 </xref> ). Many empirical and semi-empirical spectral indices&#x02014;such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), and chlorophyll index&#x02014;have been designed and derived from the leaf reflectance spectra and found to be correlated with plant physiological status. Biological samples are abundant in chemical bonds that absorb strongly in the mid infrared region, and those strong vibrational bands cause discernible bands (their combinations, 1st overtone and 2nd overtone) in the SWIR region. This forms the chemical basis of using SWIR to quantify properties such as protein, <span class="trait">phosphorus,</span> cellulose, hemicellulose, and mineral (ash) contents in the processed (usually dried and ground) plant materials (Batten, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> 1998 </xref> ; Curran et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> 2001 </xref> ). Multivariate modeling techniques such as principal component regression and partial least squares regression are often used in these applications to model the association between plant chemical data and spectral data.

						The result that water <span class="trait">content</span> can be predicted from hyperspectral imaging is not surprising. Water is a strong absorber in the <span class="gene">NIR</span> and SWIR spectral range, and the variation of reflected light energy is therefore sensitive to probe water status in plants. In fact, spectral indices have been constructed from known water absorption bands (such as those at 970, 1,240, 1,450 nm) as proxies for plant canopy water <span class="trait">content</span> in remote sensing (Gao, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"> 1996 </xref> ; Penuelas et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"> 1997 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As an alternative to hyperspectral imaging, researchers have tested the use of a single band <span class="gene">NIR</span> camera (with a wide spectral response covering 900&#x02013;1,700 nm) to quantify plant water <span class="trait">content</span> (Chen et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"> 2014 </xref> ; Neilson et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"> 2015 </xref> ). Although, <span class="gene">NIR</span> images are much easier to process, their studies were only able to establish a qualitative relationship between the single band <span class="gene">NIR</span> images and leaf water <span class="trait">content.</span> This study suggests that hyperspectral imaging provides substantially more accurate predictions of leaf water <span class="trait">content.</span> The improved accuracy of predictions with hyperspectral imaging relative to broad spectrum <span class="gene">NIR</span> imaging can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, hyperspectral imaging captures reflectance at many contiguous narrow spectral bands, allowing the water absorption bands to be better resolved. Secondly, PLSR modeling (which is not possible with single band <span class="gene">NIR</span> images) is highly efficient in extracting useful spectral information correlated with water <span class="trait">content</span> even in the presence of confounding factors and noises. This result also confirms the conclusions of a previous study we conducted that showed hyperspectral imaging predicted plant leaf water <span class="trait">content</span> across two contrasting maize genotypes successfully (Ge et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"> 2016 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Finally, the positive results obtained in this study, indicate that it may also be feasible to use hyperspectral imaging data to phenotype for other plant chemical properties. For example, there is a wide interest in breeding improved accessions of energy crops for dedicated biofuel production (for example, biomass sorghum). One of the greatest challenges is to breed for optimized biomass compositions (in particular lignin <span class="trait">content</span> which simultaneously determines standability, <span class="trait">resistance</span> to fungi and diseases during growth, and to chemical and microbial pretreatments for biomass conversion) without compromising <span class="trait">yield</span> or abiotic or biotic stress tolerance (Rooney et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"> 2007 </xref> ; Yuan et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr"> 2008 </xref> ). The lack of a non-destructive, <italic> in vivo </italic> screening tool that can measure biomass composition rapidly is a perceived bottleneck for the effective utilization of high throughput genomics-assisted breeding efforts in sorghum. Our results suggest that hyperspectral imaging could be an effective tool to fill in that technological <span class="gene">gap</span> in plant breeders' toolkit. It is quite possible that hyperspectral imaging can predict the chemical compositions of cell wall (such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and ash) from both plant leaves and stems.
