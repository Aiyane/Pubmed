				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy protein is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the <span class="trait">acidic</span> (A) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> <span class="trait">subunit,</span> and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> <span class="trait">subunit</span> when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> <span class="trait">subunit</span> was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, soy proteins were reduced with 0.1-10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to obtain an increasing number of sulphydryl groups (SH) with a similar particle size. Aggregation was promoted by increasing the degree of reduction when heated (100°C, 30min), resulting in larger sized aggregates (from 40 to 70nm) and a higher viscosity of the aggregate dispersion. The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of <span class="trait">acidic</span> (A) polypeptide of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation. The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on protein aggregates formation.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> cDNA was modified and used to produce structurally altered 11S storage protein subunits. We evaluated these modified subunits for their ability to assemble into oligomers. Alterations made in the <span class="trait">acidic</span> polypeptide changed the <span class="trait">subunit</span> solubility characteristics but did not eliminate assembly. Modifications in the basic polypeptide usually eliminated assembly of subunits into trimers. A region exhibiting high natural variability located at the COOH terminus of the <span class="trait">acidic</span> polypeptide that we have designated the hypervariable region was also studied. Extensive deletions and insertions were tolerated in the hypervariable region without perturbing <span class="trait">subunit</span> assembly. Some of the insertions significantly increased the methionine <span class="trait">content</span> in the <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> <span class="trait">subunit.</span> Together, our results indicated that the structure of the basic polypeptide was more critical for assembly of trimers than that of the <span class="trait">acidic</span> polypeptide, an observation that implies that the basic polypeptides direct trimer formation. The assembly assays described here will be useful in efforts to improve <span class="trait">seed</span> quality. Using them, the effects of modifications to the storage protein subunits can be rapidly evaluated before introducing the mutated genes into plants.

						Small technical variation was observed for <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G1, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G2, and <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1 with an average %CV less than 10 and a majority of %CV values being 5&#x02013;15. Medium technical variation was observed for Beta conglycinin &#x003b1; <span class="trait">subunit,</span> Gly m Bd 28k, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G3, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G4, and <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 with average %CV of less than 15 and a majority of the %CV values being 5&#x02013;25.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Genotypic and environmental variation assessed using %CV are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> . From this plot, the amount of variation observed was larger between locations than between cultivars, with <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1 being the only exception, showing over onefold greater variation from the cultivar than the location. <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 showed a similar differential in variation but in an opposite direction, with the location providing over threefold greater variation than the cultivar. <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1 expression was influenced more by the genotype and <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 was affected more by the environment based on the <italic> F </italic> statistics and <italic> P </italic> values (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ). <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1 expression was the only allergen clearly influenced by the cultivar in this study compared to the other allergens with an <italic> F </italic> -value of 61.57 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ). Cultivar 92B12 had the highest amount of <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1 protein and cultivar 93B15 had the lowest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ). The expression trend of <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 was similar among the cultivars. The environment had the greatest impact on <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 expression in this study compared to the other allergens, with an <italic> F </italic> -value of 70.54. Cultivar 92B12 had higher levels of <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 compared to the other three commercial cultivars (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ). However, all the cultivars grown in Ontario had low levels of <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 compared to the other locations. <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3 levels were twofold to fourfold&#x02013; reduced for each cultivar grown in Ontario. These drastic differences in variation between the two variables (cultivar and location) were unique to the KTIs. Four paralogs for the <span class="trait">seed</span> storage protein <span class="trait">glycinin</span> were individually quantified based upon unique peptides, which revealed a surprising range of expression variation. The most prominently expressed paralog, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G1, showed 5% variation with respect to cultivar and 10% for location, indicating that neither variable was causing large expression changes, when considering %CV. <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G2 also showed low overall variation, however, the disparity between variation from location and cultivar was large, 15 and 2% respectively. In contrast, one of the two lower abundance forms, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G3, has the largest percent variation. Location resulted in variation exceeding 60%, which was approximately twice the variation observed among cultivars.

						The following can be seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> : (1) Across the 24 samples (four cultivars at six sites), <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G2, <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G4, and Beta conglycinin &#x003b1; were positively correlated (a small acute angle), and <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3-1 and <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3-2 were positively correlated (an acute angle). <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G3 was negatively correlated with <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G2, <span class="gene">KTI</span> 1, <span class="gene">KTI</span> 3, Beta conglycinin &#x003b1;, and <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> G4 (obtuse angles). (2) Samples tended to be clustered together by sites. All four cultivars from the GA site were at the lower left quadrant of the biplot. All four cultivars from the ON site were at the left part of the biplot. All four cultivars from the PA site were at the upper part of the biplot. All four cultivars from the KS site were at the right part of the biplot. All four cultivars from IA and NE sites were at the lower part of the biplot and showed similar pattern by cultivar. From PCA analysis it can be concluded that variation among sites (i.e., environment) was the dominant variation for allergens.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared to β-conglycinin, <span class="trait">glycinin</span> contains 3-4 times the methionine and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a <span class="trait">subunit</span> of <span class="trait">glycinin.</span> These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.
