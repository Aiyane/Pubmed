				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The CLAVATA pathway that regulates stem cell numbers of the shoot apical meristem has exclusively been studied in Arabidopsis; as such insight into other species is warranted. In this study, a <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> mutant (F-S562L) with altered lateral organ development, and two mutants of <span class="gene">GmNARK,</span> isolated from a Forrest M2 population (EMS-mutated soybean) were studied. <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> and <span class="gene">GmNARK</span> encode for LRR receptor kinases, and share 92% of protein sequence. While <span class="gene">GmNARK</span> is critical for systemic regulation of nodulation (new organ made on the root through symbiosis), we show that <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> functions locally and has no apparent function in nodulation or root development. However, a recessive, loss-of-function mutation (S562L) in a putative S-glycosylation site of <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> causes stem nodal identity alterations as well as flower and <span class="trait">pod</span> abnormalities (deformed flower and <span class="trait">pod).</span> The mutant also exhibits a homeotic phenotype, displaying abnormal leaf development/number, vein-derived leaf emergence, and a thick, faciated stem. The mutant phenotype is also temperature-sensitive. Interestingly, a novel truncated version of <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> was identified upstream of <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> that is absent from <span class="gene">GmNARK,</span> but is present upstream of the <span class="gene">GmNARK</span> orthologues, MtSUNN and PvNARK. Taken together, our findings indicate that <span class="gene">GmCLV1A</span> acts on shoot architecture, whereas <span class="gene">GmNARK,</span> functions in controlling nodule numbers.

						Seed-size/weight traits, controlled by multiple genes in soybean, play an important role in determining seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the seed size and weight in soybean remain unclear. In Arabidopsis, P450/CYP78A gene family has been proved extremely relevant to seed size (such as AtCYP78A5, AtCYP78A6 and AtCYP78A9). We found that a soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene underwent artificial selection during soybean breeding. The <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele mainly distributed in wild soybean (Glycine soja), but has been eliminated in the cultivars during early stage of soybean breeding, while the <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele has been accumulated and become the predominant allele in cultivated soybean (G. max). ANOVA analysis showed that the mean seed weight, seed width and seed thickness of soybean varieties with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele was significantly heavier/bigger than those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01). The allele could explain 7.2 % variation in seed weight. The <span class="trait">pod</span> number of the soybeans with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele significantly decreased compared to those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01, R(2) = 5.8 %), while other agronomic traits including seed weight/plant were not significantly affected by these two alleles. We speculated that during the early stage of soybean breeding, breeders selected big seed carrying <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele, but lowered <span class="trait">pod</span> number simultaneously. Overall, the selection did not cause the significantly change in soybean seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> Our results suggests that the soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene may have a similar function to those genes belonging to P450/CYP78A subfamily in Arabidopsis and provides new information for the genetic control of seed size in soybean.

						Most soybean cultivars possess broad leaflets; however, a recessive allele on the <span class="gene">Ln</span> locus is known to cause the alteration of broad to narrow leaflets. The recessive allele ln has also been considered to increase the number of seeds per <span class="trait">pod</span> (NSP) and has the potential to improve <span class="trait">yield.</span> Recently, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma20g25000),</span> a gene controlling Ln, has been shown to complement leaf shape and silique length in Arabidopsis mutants. However, whether <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> is responsible for those traits in soybean is not yet known. In this study, we investigated the pleiotropic effect of soybean <span class="gene">Ln</span> gene on leaflet shape and NSP by using two independent soybean <span class="gene">Gm-jag1</span> mutants and four ln near isogenic lines (NILs). The leaflet shape was evaluated using a leaf image analysis software, SmartLeaf, which was customized from SmartGrain. The leaflets of both the <span class="gene">Gm-jag1</span> mutants were longer and narrower than those of the wild-type plants. Interestingly, the image analysis results clarified that the perimeter of the mutant leaflets did not change, although their leaflet area decreased. Furthermore, one mutant line with narrow leaflets showed significantly higher NSP than that in the wild (or Ln) genotype, indicating that soybean <span class="gene">Ln</span> gene pleiotropically controls leaflet shape and NSP.

						KEY MESSAGE: A high-resolution genetic map that was constructed for the Lf1 -residing region will provide valuable information for map-based cloning and genetic improvement efforts in soybean. Changes in leaf architecture as photosynthesis factories remain a major challenge for the improvement of crop productivity. Unlike most soybeans, which have compound leaves comprising three leaflets, the soybean Lf1 mutant has a high frequency of compound leaves with five leaflets in a partially dominant manner. Here, we generated a fine genetic map to determine the genetic basis of this multifoliolate leaf trait. A five-leaflet variant Dusam was found in a recently collected landrace cultivar. Phenotypic data were collected from the F2 population of a cross between the Dusam and three-leaflet cultivar V94-5152. The mapping results generated using public markers indicated that the five-leaflet determining gene in Dusam is an allele of the previously studied Lf1 gene on chromosome 8. A high-resolution map delimited the genomic region controlling the leaflet number trait to a sequence length of 49 kb. <span class="gene">AP2</span> domain-containing <span class="gene">Glyma.08g281900</span> annotated in this 49 kb region appeared to be a strong candidate for the Lf1-encoding gene, as members of the AP2-type transcription factor family regulate lateral organ development. Dusam additionally exhibits visually distinct phenotypes for shattering and seed-coat cracking traits. However, the two traits were clearly unlinked to the Lf1 gene in our mapping population. Interestingly, the mapping results suggest that the Lf1 gene most likely exerts a pleiotropic effect on the number of seeds per <span class="trait">pod.</span> Thus, our results provide a strong foundation towards the cloning of this compound leaf development gene and marker-assisted selection of the seeds per <span class="trait">pod</span> trait.

						BACKGROUND: Hydrophobic protein from soybean (HPS) is an 8 kD cysteine-rich polypeptide that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. <span class="gene">HPS</span> is synthesized in the <span class="trait">pod</span> endocarp and deposited on the seed surface during development. Past evidence suggests that the protein may mediate the adherence or dehiscence of endocarp tissues during maturation and affect the lustre, or glossiness of the seed surface. RESULTS: A comparison of soybean germplasm by genomic DNA blot hybridization shows that the copy number and structure of the Hps locus is polymorphic among soybean cultivars and related species. Changes in Hps gene copy number were also detected by comparative genomic DNA hybridization using cDNA microarrays. The Hps copy number polymorphisms co-segregated with seed lustre phenotype and <span class="gene">HPS</span> surface protein in a cross between dull- and shiny-seeded soybeans. In soybean cultivar Harosoy 63, a minimum of 27 +/- 5 copies of the Hps gene were estimated to be present in each haploid genome. The isolation and analysis of genomic clones indicates that the core Hps locus is comprised of a tandem array of reiterated units, with each 8.6 kb unit containing a single <span class="gene">HPS</span> open reading frame. CONCLUSION: This study shows that polymorphisms at the Hps locus arise from changes in the gene copy number via gene amplification. We present a model whereby Hps copy number modulates protein expression levels and seed lustre, and we suggest that gene amplification may result from selection pressures imposed on crop plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The nutritional benefits of soybean remain underutilized as the off-flavor present in it limits the consumption and acceptability among people. The aim of the present study was to unveil the effect of the phytohormones methyl jasmonate (MJ: 0, 50 μM, 1 mM, and 15 mM) and salicylic acid (SA: 0, 50 μM, 0.1 mM, and 10 mM) as elicitors on two contrasting off-flavor soybean varieties at different growth stages (1, bloom; 2, <span class="trait">pod</span> development; 3, seed development). The effects of two elicitors varied widely and were found to be dose dependent and growth stage independent. SA reduces the lipoxygenase (LOX) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) activity, which in turn resulted in reduction in the TBA number and carbonyl value in contrast to MJ. SA 0.1 mM is the most effective dose in reduction of off-flavor determining parameters and protein oxidation, and it reduces the <span class="gene">LOX</span> and <span class="gene">HPL</span> activity by 2.3- and 2.4-fold, respectively in "high off-flavor" cultivar 'Bragg' compared to "low off-flavor" cultivar 'DS 2706' which showed 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively. This reduction in protein oxidation is also supported by enhanced content of antioxidant enzymes. Thus, phytohormone SA can be used in reduction of off-flavor generation, more effectively than MJ treatments, in soybean.

						Narrow leaflet soybean (Glycine max) varieties tend to have more seeds per <span class="trait">pod</span> than broad leaflet varieties. Narrow leaflet in soybean is conferred by a single recessive gene, ln. Here, we show that the transition from broad (Ln) to narrow leaflet (ln) is associated with an amino acid substitution in the EAR motif encoded by a gene (designated <span class="gene">Gm-JAGGED1)</span> homologous to Arabidopsis JAGGED (JAG) that regulates lateral organ development and the variant exerts a pleiotropic effect on fruit patterning. The genomic region that regulates both the traits was mapped to a 12.6-kb region containing only one gene, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1.</span> Introducing the <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> allele into a loss-of-function Arabidopsis jagged mutant partially restored the wild-type JAG phenotypes, including leaf shape, flower opening, and fruit shape, but the <span class="gene">Gm-jag1</span> (ln) and EAR-deleted <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> alleles in the jagged mutant did not result in an apparent phenotypic change. These observations indicate that despite some degree of functional change of <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> due to the divergence from Arabidopsis JAG, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> complemented the functions of JAG in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> homoeolog, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG2,</span> appears to be sub- or neofunctionalized, as revealed by the differential expression of the two genes in multiple plant tissues, a complementation test, and an allelic analysis at both loci.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Crop <span class="trait">yield</span> is a highly complex quantitative trait. Historically, successful breeding for improved grain <span class="trait">yield</span> has led to crop plants with improved source capacity, altered plant architecture, and increased <span class="trait">resistance</span> to abiotic and biotic stresses. To date, transgenic approaches towards improving crop grain <span class="trait">yield</span> have primarily focused on protecting plants from herbicide, insects, or disease. In contrast, we have focused on identifying genes that, when expressed in soybean, improve the intrinsic ability of the plant to <span class="trait">yield</span> more. Through the large scale screening of candidate genes in transgenic soybean, we identified an Arabidopsis thaliana B-box domain gene (AtBBX32) that significantly increases soybean grain <span class="trait">yield</span> year after year in multiple transgenic events in multi-location field trials. In order to understand the underlying physiological changes that are associated with increased <span class="trait">yield</span> in transgenic soybean, we examined phenotypic differences in two AtBBX32-expressing lines and found increases in plant height and node, flower, <span class="trait">pod,</span> and seed number. We propose that these phenotypic changes are likely the result of changes in the timing of reproductive development in transgenic soybean that lead to the increased duration of the <span class="trait">pod</span> and seed development period. Consistent with the role of BBX32 in A. thaliana in regulating light signaling, we show that the constitutive expression of AtBBX32 in soybean alters the abundance of a subset of gene transcripts in the early morning hours. In particular, AtBBX32 alters transcript levels of the soybean clock genes <span class="gene">GmTOC1</span> and LHY-CCA1-like2 <span class="gene">(GmLCL2).</span> We propose that through the expression of AtBBX32 and modulation of the abundance of circadian clock genes during the transition from dark to light, the timing of critical phases of reproductive development are altered. These findings demonstrate a specific role for AtBBX32 in modulating soybean development, and demonstrate the validity of expressing single genes in crops to deliver increased agricultural productivity.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A field study was conducted in 2006 at Sari Agricultural and Natural Resources University, in order to determine the best time for weed control in soybean promising line, 033. Experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design with 4 replications and two series of treatments. In the first series, weeds were kept in place until crop reached <span class="gene">V2</span> (second trifoliolate), V4 (fourth trifoliolate), V6 (sixth trifoliolate), R1 (beginning bloom, first flower), R3 (beginning <span class="trait">pod),</span> R5 (beginning seed) and were then removed and the crop kept weed-free for the rest of the season. In the second series, crops were kept weed-free until the above growth stages after which weeds were allowed to grow in the plots for the rest of the season. Whole season weedy and weed-free plots were included in the experiment for <span class="trait">yield</span> comparison. The results showed that among studied traits, grain <span class="trait">yield,</span> <span class="trait">pod</span> numbers per plant and weed biomass were affected significantly by control and interference treatments. The highest number of pods per plant was obtained from plots which kept weed-free for whole season control. Results showed that weed control should be carried out between <span class="gene">V2</span> (26 day after planting) to R1 (63 day after planting) stages of soybean to provide maximum grain <span class="trait">yield.</span> Thus, it is possible to optimize the timing of weed control, which can serve to reduce the costs and side effects of intensive chemical weed control.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Narrow leaflet cultivars tend to have more seeds per <span class="trait">pod</span> than broad leaflet cultivars in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], which suggests that the leaflet-shape trait locus is tightly linked to or cosegregates with the trait locus controlling the number of seeds per <span class="trait">pod</span> (NSPP). Here, we attempted to further elucidate the relationship between leaflet shape and NSPP. A BC(3)F(2) population from a cross between the 'Sowon' (narrow leaflets and high NSPP) and 'V94-5152' (broad leaflets and low NSPP) variants was used. The results of the molecular genetic analyses indicated that, although the NSPP characteristic, in particular, the occurrence of 4-seeded pods, is governed by additional modifying genes that are likely present in Sowon, the two traits cosegregate in the BC(3)F(2) population. The mapping results generated using public markers demonstrated that the narrow leaflet-determining gene in Sowon is an allele of the previously highly studied ln gene on chromosome 20. A high-resolution map delimited the genomic region controlling both the leaflet shape and NSPP traits to a sequence length of 66 kb, corresponding to 0.7 cM. Among the three genes annotated in this 66 kb region, <span class="gene">Glyma20g25000.1</span> appeared to be a good candidate for the Ln-encoding gene, owing to its 47.8% homology with the protein encoding for the JAGGED gene that regulates lateral organ development in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results suggested that phenotypic variations for narrow leaflet and NSPP are predominantly from the pleiotropic effects of the ln gene. Thus, our results should provide a molecular framework for soybean breeding programs with the objective of improving soybean <span class="trait">yield.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The alternative oxidase mediates the cyanide-resistant respiratory pathway in plant mitochondria. In non-thermogenic plants, the role of alternative oxidase in plant growth and development is not well understood. Soybean (Glycine max) lines carrying a <span class="gene">GmAOX2b</span> antisense gene had compromised vegetative growth and reproductive performance under typical glasshouse growth conditions. The reduction in vegetative growth was demonstrated by reduction in shoot height, the number of leaves per plant and the green leaf area. Antisense plants also had decreased <span class="trait">pod</span> formation and seed to <span class="trait">pod</span> ratios, which together led to a reduction in the number and total mass of seed produced. The negative effects of the antisense gene on <span class="trait">pod</span> set, seed set, ovule availability and total seed mass were primarily confined to the branches, rather than the main stem. The preferential effect of alternative oxidase suppression in the branches is discussed in relation to the reproductive potential of soybean under stress. Taken together, these results demonstrate that alternative oxidase provides the benefit of sustaining plant vegetative growth and reproductive capacity in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objectives of this study were to use mixed models to confirm the presence of genetic variability in 16 soybean genotypes, to compare clusters generated by artificial neural networks (ANNs) with those created by the Ward modified location model (MLM) technique, and to indicate parental combinations that hold promise for obtaining superior segregating populations of soybean. A field trial was conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 at Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul, Aquidauana, MS. The experimental design consisted of four replications of randomized blocks, each containing 16 treatments. We assessed the following agronomic traits: plant height, first <span class="trait">pod</span> height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of grains per <span class="trait">pod,</span> hundred-grain weight, and grain <span class="trait">yield.</span> Mixed models were used to estimate variance components and genetic parameters, and obtain genotypic values for each trait. After verifying the presence of genetic variability for all traits, genotypic values were submitted to both a Ward-MLM procedure and ANNs to estimate genetic divergence among genotypes. The number of groups formed by both methods was the same, but there were differences in group constitutions. <span class="gene">ANN</span> analysis improved soybean genotypes clustering patterns compared to Ward-MLM procedure. Based on these methods, divergent crosses may be made between genotype 97R73 with genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070, whereas convergent crosses may be made between genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070.

						BACKGROUND: Bi-parental mapping populations have been commonly utilized to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling <span class="trait">resistance</span> to soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe). Although this approach successfully mapped a large number of SCN <span class="trait">resistance</span> QTL, it captures only limited allelic diversity that exists in parental lines, and it also has limitations for genomic resolution. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a diverse set of 553 soybean plant introductions (PIs) belonging to <span class="trait">maturity</span> groups from III to V to detect QTL/genes associated with SCN <span class="trait">resistance</span> to HG Type 0. RESULTS: Over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers generated by the SoySNP50K iSelect BeadChip (http// www.soybase.org ) were utilized for analysis. GWAS identified 14 loci distributed over different chromosomes comprising 60 SNPs significantly associated with SCN <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Results also confirmed six QTL that were previously mapped using bi-parental populations, including the rhg1 and <span class="gene">Rhg4</span> loci. GWAS identified eight novel QTL, including QTL on chromosome 10, which we have previously mapped by using a bi-parental population. In addition to the known loci for four simple traits, such as seed coat color, flower color, pubescence color, and stem growth habit, two traits, like <span class="trait">lodging</span> and <span class="trait">pod</span> shattering, having moderately complex inheritance have been confirmed with great precision by GWAS. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that GWAS can be employed as an effective strategy for identifying complex traits in soybean and for narrowing GWAS-defined genomic regions, which facilitates positional cloning of the causal gene(s).

						Charcoal rot disease, caused by the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, leads to significant <span class="trait">yield</span> losses of soybean crops. One strategy to control charcoal rot is the use of antagonistic, root-colonizing bacteria. Rhizobacteria A(5)F and FPT(7)21 and Pseudomonas sp. strain GRP(3) were characterized for their plant growth-promotion activities against the pathogen. Rhizobacterium FPT(7)21 exhibited higher antagonistic activity against the pathogen on dual plate assay compared to strain A(5)F and GRP(3). FPT(7)21 and GRP(3) gave decreased disease intensity in terms of average number of pathogen-infested plants. Lipoxygenase (LOX), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and peroxidase <span class="trait">(POD)</span> activities were estimated in extracts of plants grown from seeds that were treated with rhizobacteria, and inoculated with spore suspension of M. phaseolina. The activity of these enzymes after challenge with the test pathogen increased. Strains FPT(7)21 and GRP(3) exhibited maximum increases in LOX, <span class="gene">PAL</span> and <span class="trait">POD</span> activity (U mg(-1) fresh leaf wt) compared to strain A(5)F.
