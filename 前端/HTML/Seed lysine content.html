				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the presented study the influence of dehulling rapeseed on the composition of rapeseed meal (RM) and rapeseed cake (RC) and on its feed value for piglets and growing-finishing pigs was investigated. Before withdrawal of oil, rapeseed (variety Express) was dehulled applying a procedure developed by SKET <span class="gene">GmbH</span> Magdeburg and the Section Food-Technology of the University Essen. The steps of the dehulling procedure were described. For RM the oil was removed by the prepress-solvent procedure till a crude fat <span class="trait">content</span> of 2.1% in DM. RC was produced by pressing only resulting approximately 13% crude fat in DM. The RM and RC from not dehulled (ND) and dehulled (D) rapeseed were examined analytically. Crude nutrients, sugar and fibre substances, amino acids, some minerals and trace elements, fatty acids, glucosinolates and sinapine, and phytate were determined. By dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> the crude fibre <span class="trait">content</span> was decreased in RM and RC by approximately 40%. The ADF <span class="trait">content</span> declined by 35 and 39%, and the NDF <span class="trait">content</span> by 28% and 40% in RM and RC, respectively. The decrease in ADL <span class="trait">content</span> amounted to 50% and 65% for RM and RC, respectively. On the other hand, the CP <span class="trait">content</span> of RM and RC was increased by 7% and 13%, respectively, by dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> while the amino acid <span class="trait">content</span> of rape protein increased only slightly. The contents of glucosinolates and sinapine were also increased by dehulling, while the contents of phytate and phytate P were decreased. In digestibility and balance experiments with piglets and intact hybrid breeds of growing-finishing pigs, the digestibility of organic matter and of crude nutrients and the contents of digestible energy and metabolizable energy were estimated. Furthermore, the precaecal digestibility of crude nutrients and amino acids was determined with fistulated mini-pigs. By dehulling the seeds the digestibility of organic matter from RM and RC was improved in piglets and adult pigs by approximately 10%, and the ME contents increased by 13-15%. The precaecal digestibility of the sum of amino acids was increased by approximately 3 and 6 units in RM and RC, respectively. The precaecal digestibility of <span class="trait">lysine</span> in RM and RC reached that of soybean oil meal from not dehulled beans.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We have increased the <span class="trait">lysine</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in the seeds of canola and soybean plants by circumventing the normal feedback regulation of two enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway, aspartokinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinic acid synthase (DHDPS). Lysine-feedback-insensitive bacterial DHDPS and AK enzymes encoded by the Corynebacterium <span class="gene">dapA</span> gene and a mutant E. coli <span class="gene">lysC</span> gene, respectively, were linked to a chloroplast transit peptide and expressed from a seed-specific promoter in transgenic canola and soybean seeds. Expression of Corynebacterium DHDPS resulted in more than a 100-fold increase in the accumulation of free <span class="trait">lysine</span> in the seeds of canola; total <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">lysine</span> <span class="trait">content</span> approximately doubled. Expression of Corynebacterium DHDPS plus lysine-insensitive E. coli AK in soybean transformants similarly caused several hundred-fold increases in free <span class="trait">lysine</span> and increased total sed <span class="trait">lysine</span> <span class="trait">content</span> by as much as 5-fold. Accumulation of alpha-amino adipic acid (AA) in canola and saccharopine in soybean, which are intermediates in <span class="trait">lysine</span> catabolism, was also observed.
