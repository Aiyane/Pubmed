						BACKGROUND: Soybean is a major source of oil and protein in the human diet and in animal feed. However, as soybean is deficient in sulfur-containing amino acids, its nutritional value is limited. Increasing sulfate assimilation and utilization <span class="trait">efficiency</span> is a valuable approach to augment the concentration of sulfur-containing amino acids in soybean seeds, and sulfate transporters play important roles in both sulfate uptake and translocation within plants. RESULTS: In this study, we isolated and characterized a soybean sulfate transporter gene: <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b.</span> The gene was found to be specifically expressed in root tissues and induced by low-sulfur stress. In addition, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> expression in yeast could complement deficiency in the sulfate transporter genes SUL1 and SUL2. Under +S conditions, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> tobacco plants accumulated higher levels of organic matter and exhibited enhanced biomass and seed weight compared to control plants. Under -S conditions, acclimation of <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> plants was much better than control plants. <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> tobacco seedlings showed better tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress than the control plants, but no significant difference was observed under salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed 515 genes with at least a 2-fold change in expression in the leaves of tobacco plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b.</span> Of these, 227 gene annotations were classified into 12 functional categories associated with 123 relevant pathways, including biosynthesis and metabolism-related proteins, stress-related proteins, and transporters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported here indicate that the increased biomass and seed <span class="trait">yield</span> observed in transgenic tobacco plants could have resulted from greater nutrient uptake and transport capability as well as enhanced development and accumulation of organic matter. Taken together, our results indicate that <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> plays an important role in <span class="trait">sulfur</span> uptake and could alter the <span class="trait">sulfur</span> status of plants. Our study suggests that overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> may enhance plant <span class="trait">yield</span> under +S conditions, reduce plant production loss under -S conditions, and improve plant tolerance to <span class="trait">sulfur</span> deficiency stress.

						Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) catalyzes the limiting reaction in plant and microbial biosynthesis of cysteine. In addition to its enzymatic function, SAT forms a macromolecular complex with O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. Formation of the cysteine regulatory complex (CRC) is a critical biochemical control feature in plant <span class="trait">sulfur</span> metabolism. Here we present the 1.75-3.0 Å resolution x-ray crystal structures of soybean (Glycine max) SAT <span class="gene">(GmSAT)</span> in apoenzyme, serine-bound, and CoA-bound forms. The <span class="gene">GmSAT-serine</span> and <span class="gene">GmSAT-CoA</span> structures provide new details on substrate interactions in the active site. The crystal structures and analysis of site-directed mutants suggest that His(169) and Asp(154) form a catalytic dyad for general base catalysis and that His(189) may stabilize the oxyanion reaction intermediate. Glu(177) helps to position Arg(203) and His(204) and the β1c-β2c loop for serine binding. A similar role for ionic interactions formed by Lys(230) is required for CoA binding. The <span class="gene">GmSAT</span> structures also identify Arg(253) as important for the enhanced catalytic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of SAT in the CRC and suggest that movement of the residue may stabilize CoA binding in the macromolecular complex. Differences in the effect of cold on <span class="gene">GmSAT</span> activity in the isolated enzyme versus the enzyme in the CRC were also observed. A role for CRC formation as a molecular chaperone to maintain SAT activity in response to an environmental stress is proposed for this multienzyme complex in plants.

						<span class="trait">Sulfur</span> is an essential element for rhizobia, such as sulfated modified Nod factors and nitrogenase. To investigate the role of <span class="trait">sulfur</span> metabolism in Rhizobium-Soybean symbiosis, a transponson random insertional mutants' library was constructed and a <span class="trait">sulfur</span> assimilation-related gene was isolated and characterized. A mutant strain unable to utilized sulfate was screened from 11,000 random insertional mutants of Sinorhizobium fredii WGF03. Sequencing analysis showed that a sulfate assimilation-related gene (cysDN) was inserted by the Tn transponson. Mutants inactivated in <span class="gene">cysD</span> and <span class="gene">cysN</span> (SMcysDF and SMcysNF) were constructed by homologous recombination using the suicide plasmid pK18mob. The mutants SMcysDF and SMcysNF could no longer utilize sulfate as <span class="trait">sulfur</span> source. Phenotype analysis revealed that mutation of cysDN had multiple effects on S. fredii WGF03. Root hair deformation assay showed that the activity of Nod factors secreted by mutants SMcysDR and SMcysNR elicited minimal hair initiation only. Soybean plant tests indicated that the mutant strains delayed 1-2 days to nodulate and exhibited lower nodulation <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and symbiotic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> than the wild-type strain. The complementary strain of <span class="gene">cysD</span> and <span class="gene">cysN</span> (HcysDF and HcysNF) could restore the nodulation <span class="trait">efficiency.</span>
