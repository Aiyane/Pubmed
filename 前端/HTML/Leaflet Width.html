						BACKGROUND: Strigolactones (SLs) play important roles in controlling root growth, shoot <span class="trait">branching,</span> and plant-symbionts interaction. Despite the importance, the components of SL biosynthesis and signaling have not been unequivocally explored in soybean. RESULTS: Here we identified the putative components of SL synthetic enzymes and signaling proteins in soybean genome. Soybean genome contains conserved MORE AXILLARY <span class="trait">BRANCHING</span> (MAX) orthologs, <span class="gene">GmMAX1s,</span> <span class="gene">GmMAX2s,</span> <span class="gene">GmMAX3s,</span> and <span class="gene">GmMAX4s.</span> The tissue expression patterns are coincident with SL synthesis in roots and signaling in other tissues under normal conditions. <span class="gene">GmMAX1a,</span> <span class="gene">GmMAX2a,</span> <span class="gene">GmMAX3b,</span> and <span class="gene">GmMAX4a</span> expression in their Arabidopsis orthologs' mutants not only restored most characteristic phenotypes, such as shoot <span class="trait">branching</span> and shoot height, leaf shape, primary root length, and root hair growth, but also restored the significantly changed hormone contents, such as reduced JA and ABA contents in all mutant leaves, but increased auxin levels in atmax1, atmax3 and atmax4 mutants. Overexpression of these <span class="gene">GmMAXs</span> also altered the hormone contents in wild-type Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> was further characterized in soybean nodulation with overexpression and knockdown transgenic hairy roots. <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> overexpression <span class="gene">(GmMAX3b-OE)</span> lines exhibited increased nodule number while <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> knockdown <span class="gene">(GmMAX3b-KD)</span> decreased the nodule number in transgenic hairy roots. The expression levels of several key nodulation genes were also altered in <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> transgenic hairy roots. <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> overexpression hairy roots had reduced ABA, but increased JA levels, with no significantly changed auxin content, while the contrast changes were observed in <span class="gene">GmMAX3b-KD</span> lines. Global gene expression in <span class="gene">GmMAX3b-OE</span> or <span class="gene">GmMAX3b-KD</span> hairy roots also revealed that altered expression of <span class="gene">GmMAX3b</span> in soybean hairy roots changed several subsets of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling and transcriptional regulation of nodulation processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study not only revealed the conservation of SL biosynthesis and signaling in soybean, but also showed possible interactions between SL and other hormone synthesis and signaling during controlling plant development and soybean nodulation. <span class="gene">GmMAX3b-mediated</span> SL biosynthesis and signaling may be involved in soybean nodulation by affecting both root hair formation and its interaction with rhizobia.

						The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors plays an important role in the growth and developmental process as well as responds to various abiotic stresses, such as <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salinity. Our previous work identified <span class="gene">GmFDL19,</span> a bZIP transcription factor, as a flowering promoter in soybean, and the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> caused early flowering in transgenic soybean plants. Here, we report that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> also enhances tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt stress in soybean. <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> was determined to be a group A member, and its transcription expression was highly induced by abscisic acid (ABA), polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) and high salt stresses. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> in soybean enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt tolerance at the seedling stage. The relative plant height (RPH) and relative shoot dry weight (RSDW) of transgenic plants were significantly higher than those of the WT after PEG and salt treatments. In addition, the germination rate and plant height of the transgenic soybean were also significantly higher than that of WT plants after various salt treatments. Furthermore, we also found that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> could reduce the accumulation of Na+ ion content and up-regulate the expression of several ABA/stress-responsive genes in transgenic soybean. We also found that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> overexpression increased the activities of several antioxidative enzyme and chlorophyll content but reduced malondialdehyde content. These results suggested that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> is involved in soybean abiotic stress responses and has potential utilization to improve multiple stress tolerance in transgenic soybean.

						Plant-specific () genes play critical roles in various plant growth and development processes. However, the number and characteristics of genes in soybean [ (L.) Merr.] remain unknown. Here, we identified 90 homologous genes in the soybean genome that phylogenetically clustered into two classes (I and II). The majority of the genes were evenly distributed across all 20 soybean chromosomes, and 77 (81.11%) of them were detected in segmental duplicated regions. Furthermore, the exon-intron organization and motif composition for each were analyzed. A close phylogenetic relationship was identified between the soybean genes and 41 previously reported genes of different plants in the same group, providing insights into their putative functions. Expression analysis indicated that more than half of the genes were expressed, with the two gene classes showing differential tissue expression characteristics; in addition, they were differentially induced by biotic and abiotic stresses. To further explore the functions of genes in soybean, was selected for functional characterization. <span class="gene">GmLBD12</span> was mainly localized to the nucleus and showed high expression in root and seed tissues. Overexpressing in (L.) Heynh resulted in increases in lateral root (LR) number and plant height. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt, cold, indole acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid SA treatments. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the soybean gene family and a valuable foundation for future functional studies of genes.

						Mapping quantitative trait loci through the use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in populations of unrelated individuals provides a valuable approach for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in soybean (Glycine max). The haplotype-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) has now been proposed as a complementary approach to intensify benefits from LD, which enable to assess the genetic determinants of agronomic traits. In this study a GWAS was undertaken to identify genomic regions that control 100-seed weight (SW), plant height (PH) and seed <span class="trait">yield</span> (SY) in a soybean association mapping panel using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and haplotype information. The soybean cultivars (N = 169) were field-evaluated across four locations of southern Brazil. The genome-wide haplotype association analysis (941 haplotypes) identified eleven, seventeen and fifty-nine SNP-based haplotypes significantly associated with SY, SW and PH, respectively. Although most marker-trait associations were environment and trait specific, stable haplotype associations were identified for SY and SW across environments (i.e., haplotypes <span class="gene">Gm12_Hap12).</span> The haplotype block 42 on Chr19 <span class="gene">(Gm19_Hap42)</span> was confirmed to be associated with PH in two environments. These findings enable us to refine the breeding strategy for tropical soybean, which confirm that haplotype-based GWAS can provide new insights on the genetic determinants that are not captured by the single-marker approach.

						Soybean oil is highly unsaturated but oxidatively unstable, rendering it nonideal for food applications. Until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent partial chemical hydrogenation, which produces trans fats as an unavoidable consequence. Dietary intake of trans fats and most saturated fats are conclusively linked to negative impacts on cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health. Two major soybean oil breeding targets are: (1) to reduce or eliminate the need for chemical hydrogenation, and (2) to replace the functional properties of partially hydrogenated soybean oil. One potential solution is the elevation of seed stearic acid, a saturated fat which has no negative impacts on cardiovascular health, from 3 to 4% in typical cultivars to &gt; 20% of the seed oil. We performed QTL analysis of a population developed by crossing two mutant lines, one with a missense mutation affecting a stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase gene resulting in ∼11% seed stearic acid crossed to another mutant, A6, which has 24-28% seed stearic acid. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)-based QTL mapping identified 21 minor and major effect QTL for six seed oil related traits and plant height. The inheritance of a large genomic deletion affecting chromosome 14 is the basis for largest effect QTL, resulting in ∼18% seed stearic acid. This deletion contains <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> and another gene(s); loss of both genes boosts seed stearic acid levels to ≥ 18%. Unfortunately, this genomic deletion has been shown in previous studies to be inextricably correlated with reduced seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> Our results will help inform and guide ongoing breeding efforts to improve soybean oil oxidative stability.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objectives of this study were to use mixed models to confirm the presence of genetic variability in 16 soybean genotypes, to compare clusters generated by artificial neural networks (ANNs) with those created by the Ward modified location model (MLM) technique, and to indicate parental combinations that hold promise for obtaining superior segregating populations of soybean. A field trial was conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 at Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul, Aquidauana, MS. The experimental design consisted of four replications of randomized blocks, each containing 16 treatments. We assessed the following agronomic traits: plant height, first pod height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of grains per pod, hundred-grain weight, and grain <span class="trait">yield.</span> Mixed models were used to estimate variance components and genetic parameters, and obtain genotypic values for each trait. After verifying the presence of genetic variability for all traits, genotypic values were submitted to both a Ward-MLM procedure and ANNs to estimate genetic divergence among genotypes. The number of groups formed by both methods was the same, but there were differences in group constitutions. <span class="gene">ANN</span> analysis improved soybean genotypes clustering patterns compared to Ward-MLM procedure. Based on these methods, divergent crosses may be made between genotype 97R73 with genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070, whereas convergent crosses may be made between genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Flowering time, maturity, and plant morphology have considerable effects on the adaptation and grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of soybean (Glycine max). The identification of novel genes and an understanding of their molecular basis are critical to improve soybean productivity. In this study, we cloned a flowering time related APETALA2-like gene <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> and generated <span class="gene">GmTOE4a-overexpressing</span> lines in the cultivar Williams 82. The transgenic lines exhibited late flowering both under long day and short day conditions, and repressed the flowering-related genes, including <span class="gene">GmFT2a,</span> <span class="gene">GmFT5a,</span> <span class="gene">GmAP1,</span> and <span class="gene">GmLFY,</span> whereas the flowering repressors <span class="gene">GmFT4</span> and miR156 were upregulated. Interestingly, <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> was also mediated by photoperiod via maturity genes E3 and E4, which encode photoreceptors in soybean. Further, miR172-mediated <span class="gene">GmTOE4a,</span> which regulates flowering in soybean, is different in Arabidopsis in that it is dependent on the CONSTANS-like gene <span class="gene">GmCOL1a.</span> In addition to its effect on flowering time, <span class="gene">GmTOE4a</span> regulated plant morphology, increased stem thickness, and reduced plant height, internode length and leaf size, which are important agronomic traits that enhance the capacity to resist <span class="trait">lodging</span> and increase soybean <span class="trait">yield.</span> This is useful information to understand the molecular mechanism of flowering time and plant morphology in soybean and will greatly influence soybean <span class="trait">yield</span> improvement.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) is a photoperiod-sensitive and self-pollinated species. Days to flowering (DTF) and maturity (DTM), duration of flowering-to-maturity (DFTM) and plant height (PH) are crucial for soybean adaptability and <span class="trait">yield.</span> To dissect the genetic architecture of these agronomically important traits, a population consisting of 309 early maturity soybean germplasm accessions was genotyped with the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K BeadChip and phenotyped in multiple environments. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using a mixed linear model that involves both relative kinship and population structure. RESULTS: The linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed slowly in soybean, and a substantial difference in LD pattern was observed between euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. A total of 27, 6, 18 and 27 loci for DTF, DTM, DFTM and PH were detected via GWAS, respectively. The <span class="gene">Dt1</span> gene was identified in the locus strongly associated with both DTM and PH. Ten candidate genes homologous to Arabidopsis flowering genes were identified near the peak single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DTF. Four of them encode MADS-domain containing proteins. Additionally, a pectin lyase-like gene was also identified in a major-effect locus for PH where LD decayed rapidly. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified multiple new loci and refined chromosomal regions of known loci associated with DTF, DTM, DFTM and/or PH in soybean. It demonstrates that GWAS is powerful in dissecting complex traits and identifying candidate genes although LD decayed slowly in soybean. The loci and trait-associated SNPs identified in this study can be used for soybean genetic improvement, especially the major-effect loci associated with PH could be used to improve soybean <span class="trait">yield</span> potential. The candidate genes may serve as promising targets for studies of molecular mechanisms underlying the related traits in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Brassinosteroids (BRs) constitute a group of steroidal phytohormones that contribute to a wide range of plant growth and development functions. The genetic modulation of BR receptor genes, which play major roles in the BR signaling pathway, can create semi-dwarf plants that have great advantages in crop production. In this study, a brassinosteroid insensitive gene homologous with AtBRI1 and other BRIs was isolated from Glycine max and designated as <span class="gene">GmBRI1.</span> A bioinformatic analysis revealed that <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> shares a conserved kinase domain and 25 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are characteristic of a BR receptor for BR reception and reaction and bear a striking similarity in protein tertiary structure to AtBRI1. <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> transcripts were more abundant in soybean hypocotyls and could be upregulated in response to exogenous BR treatment. The transformation of <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> into the Arabidopsis dwarf mutant bri1-5 restored the phenotype, especially regarding pod size and plant height. Additionally, this complementation is a consequence of a restored BR signaling pathway demonstrated in the light/dark analysis, root inhibition assay and BR-response gene expression. Therefore, <span class="gene">GmBRI1</span> functions as a BR receptor to alter BR-mediated signaling and is valuable for improving plant architecture and enhancing the <span class="trait">yield</span> of soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of 2 liquid feeds and 2 protein sources in starter on the performance and blood metabolite responses of Holstein neonatal calves from birth to 6 wk of age. Calves (20 males and 20 females) based on sex were randomly assigned to 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, including soybean meal (SBM) and meat and bone meal (MB) with either fermented colostrum (or fresh milk. Although sex and liquid feed had no significant effect on feed intake, calves consumed more feed intake on the diet containing SBM (15 ± 0.2 kg) than MB (13 ± 0.2 kg) during the experimental period; also, weight gain was affected by both liquid feed and starter. Liquid feed and starter had significant effects on calf body size, including <span class="gene">pin</span> <span class="trait">width,</span> hip <span class="trait">width,</span> withers height, hip height, and stomach size, but no significant effects were observed on calf body size between the sexes. Plasma glucose concentration was not affected by sex, liquid feed, or starter. Plasma urea nitrogen concentration decreased in the first 3 wk and then started to increase during the last 3 wk, but it was only affected by starter and calves receiving SBM (10.18 mg/dL) had a higher concentration of plasma urea nitrogen than calves receiving MB (9.6 mg/dL) at the end of the experiment. Plasma growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations decreased in all treatment groups from d 0 to the end of the study. No significant effects were observed on plasma growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations between the 2 sexes, but they were significantly affected by both liquid feed and starter. Results of the present study provide useful information to apply to Holstein neonatal calves during the first 6 wk of life when liquid feed and 2 sources of protein in starter are considered.

						Soybean is a typical short-day crop, and its photoperiodic and gibberellin (GA) responses for the control of flowering are critical to seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> The <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> mRNA abundance in leaves was dramatically increased in short-days (SDs) compared to that in long-days in which it was consistently low at all time points from 0 to 6 days (days after transfer to SDs). <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was highly expressed in leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythm in SDs. Ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> in tobaccos caused photoperiod-insensitive early flowering by increasing NtCO mRNA levels. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> mRNA abundance was also increased by GAs. Transgenic <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> overexpressing (-ox) tobacco plants exhibited increased GA signaling-related phenotypes including flowering and plant height promotion. Furthermore, the hypocotyl elongation, early-flowering and longer internode phenotypes were largely accelerated by GA3 application in the <span class="gene">GmGBP1-ox</span> tobacco seedlings. Being consistent, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> resulted in significantly enhanced GA signaling (evidenced suppressed expression of NtGA20ox) both with and without GA treatments. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was a positive regulator of both photoperiod and GA-mediated flowering responses. In addition, <span class="gene">GmGBP1-ox</span> tobaccos were hypersensitive to ABA, salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination. Heat-inducible <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> also enhanced thermotolerance in transgenic <span class="gene">GmGBP1-ox</span> tobaccos during seed germination and growth. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> protein was localized in the nucleus. Analyses of a series of 5'-deletions of the <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> promoter suggested that several cis-acting elements, including P-BOX, TCA-motif and three HSE elements necessary to induce gene expression by GA, salicic acid and heat stress, were specifically localized in the <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> promoter region.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seed oil is the primary global source of edible oil and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean is desirable; however, that goal is complex due to the quantitative nature of the oil concentration trait and possible effects on major agronomic traits such as seed <span class="trait">yield</span> or protein concentration. The objectives of the present study were to study the relationship between seed oil concentration and important agronomic and seed quality traits, including seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> 100-seed weight, protein concentration, plant height, and days to maturity, and to identify oil quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are co-localized with the traits evaluated. A population of 203 F4:6 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between moderately high oil soybean genotypes OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe, was developed and grown across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. Among the 11 QTL associated with seed oil concentration in the population, which were detected using either single-factor ANOVA or multiple QTL mapping methods, the number of QTL that were co-localized with other important traits QTL were six for protein concentration, four for seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> two for 100-seed weight, one for days to maturity, and one for plant height. The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with seed protein concentration. The oil favorable alleles of markers Satt001 and <span class="gene">GmDGAT2B</span> were positively correlated with seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> In addition, significant two-way epistatic interactions, where one of the interacting markers was solely associated with seed oil concentration, were identified for the selected traits in this study. The number of significant epistatic interactions was seven for <span class="trait">yield,</span> four for days to maturity, two for 100-seed weight, one for protein concentration, and one for plant height. The identified molecular markers associated with oil-related QTL in this study, which also have positive effects on other important traits such as seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and protein concentration, could be used in the soybean marker breeding programs aimed at developing either higher seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and oil concentration or higher seed protein and oil concentration per hectare. Alternatively, selecting complementary parents with greater breeding values due to positive epistatic interactions could lead to the development of higher oil soybean cultivars.

Historically, successful breeding for improved grain <span class="trait">yield</span> has led to crop plants with improved source capacity, altered plant architecture, and increased <span class="trait">resistance</span> to abiotic and biotic stresses. To date, transgenic approaches towards improving crop grain <span class="trait">yield</span> have primarily focused on protecting plants from herbicide, insects, or disease. In contrast, we have focused on identifying genes that, when expressed in soybean, improve the intrinsic ability of the plant to <span class="trait">yield</span> more. Through the large scale screening of candidate genes in transgenic soybean, we identified an Arabidopsis thaliana B-box domain gene (AtBBX32) that significantly increases soybean grain <span class="trait">yield</span> year after year in multiple transgenic events in multi-location field trials. In order to understand the underlying physiological changes that are associated with increased <span class="trait">yield</span> in transgenic soybean, we examined phenotypic differences in two AtBBX32-expressing lines and found increases in plant height and node, flower, pod, and seed number. We propose that these phenotypic changes are likely the result of changes in the timing of reproductive development in transgenic soybean that lead to the increased duration of the pod and seed development period. Consistent with the role of BBX32 in A. thaliana in regulating light signaling, we show that the constitutive expression of AtBBX32 in soybean alters the abundance of a subset of gene transcripts in the early morning hours. In particular, AtBBX32 alters transcript levels of the soybean clock genes <span class="gene">GmTOC1</span> and LHY-CCA1-like2 <span class="gene">(GmLCL2).</span> We propose that through the expression of AtBBX32 and modulation of the abundance of circadian clock genes during the transition from dark to light, the timing of critical phases of reproductive development are altered. These findings demonstrate a specific role for AtBBX32 in modulating soybean development, and demonstrate the validity of expressing single genes in crops to deliver increased agricultural productivity.

						Soybean genotypes are adapted to narrow bands of latitude due to photoperiod sensitivity. There are several photoperiod-sensitive loci (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8). Determinate and indeterminate growth habits are controlled by a single locus. The objective of our research was to examine the effects of photoperiod sensitivity and growth habit alleles on seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and other agronomic characters using isogenic lines. Twenty 'Harosoy' isolines with 11 photoperiod-sensitive genotypes many with both indeterminate and determinate growth habits were grown in the field at Ottawa, ON, from 2003 to 2007. Maturity ranged from 97 to 127 days, and seed <span class="trait">yield</span> increased linearly with maturity until about 112 days when it plateaued. Determinate lines were always shorter than indeterminate lines of equivalent maturity. Seed <span class="trait">yield</span> was associated with plant height, maturity, seed sugar concentration, seed weight and <span class="trait">lodging.</span> Effects of alleles at individual loci, and additive and epistatic effects across multiple loci were examined. At a single locus, photoperiod-insensitive alleles produced isolines that matured 8-11 days earlier, yielded less, and had shorter plants with reduced <span class="trait">lodging.</span> In multiple loci analyses, additive effects explained most of the variation in agronomic characters since additive models with E1, E3, E4, E7 and <span class="gene">Dt1</span> loci included compared well to additive plus epistatic models and genotype-based models. Variation in photoperiod sensitivity and growth habit alleles results in a range of maturity, with pleiotropic effects on seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and agronomic characteristics, and play an important role in providing adaptation across latitudes.

						Round soybean seeds are sought-after for food-type soybean. Also the genetic control of seed geometry is of scientific interest. The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for seed shape traits. Three densely mapped recombinant inbred populations each with 192 segregants were used, Minsoy x Archer, Minsoy x Noir1, and Noir1 x Archer. A two <span class="gene">rep</span> two location experiment was conducted in Los Andes, Chile, and East Lansing, MI, USA. Seed height (SH), <span class="trait">width</span> (SW), length (SL), and seed volume (SV) as <span class="trait">width</span> x height x length were measured to determine seed shape. Heritability was estimated by variance component analysis. A total of 19 significant QTLs (LOD &gt;or= 3.7) in ten linkage groups (LG) were detected for all the traits. Only one QTL was stable across populations and environments and six were stable in at least two populations in both environments. The amount of phenotypic variation explained by a single QTL varied from 7.5% for SH, to 18.5% for SW and at least 30% of the genetic variation for the traits is controlled by four QTL or less. All traits were highly correlated with each other in all populations with values ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, except for SL and SW that were not significantly correlated or had a low correlation in all populations. Narrow sense heritabilities for all traits ranged from 0.42 to 0.88. We note that LG u9, u11, and u14 are hot points of the genome for QTLs for various traits. The number and genomic distribution of the QTLs confirms the complex genetic control of seed shape. Transgressive segregation was observed for all traits suggesting that careful selection of parents with similar phenotypes but different genotypes using molecular markers can result in desirable transgressive segregants.

						A set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from soybean vars. Kefeng No.1 x Nannong 1138-2 was used to construct a genetic linkage map. The two parents exhibit contrasting characteristics for most of the traits that were mapped. Using restricted fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we mapped 452 markers onto 21 linkage groups and covered 3595.9 cM of the soybean genome. All of the linkage groups except linkage group F were consistent with those of the consensus map of Cregan et al. (1999). Linkage group F was divided into two linkage groups, F1 and F2. The map consisted of 189 RFLPs, 219 SSRs, 40 ESTs, three R gene loci and one phenotype marker. Ten agronomic traits-days to flowering, days to maturity, plant height, number of nodes on main stem, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> number of pods per node, protein content, oil content, 100-seed weight, and plot yield-were studied. Using winqtlcart, we detected 63 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had LOD&gt;3 for nine of the agronomic traits (only exception being seed oil content) and mapped these on 12 linkage groups. Most of the QTLs were clustered, especially on groups B1 and C2. Some QTLs were mapped to the same loci. This pleiotropism was common for most of the QTLs, and one QTL could influence at most five traits. Seven EST markers were found to be linked closely with or located at the same loci as the QTLs. EST marker <span class="gene">GmKF059a,</span> encoding a repressor protein and mapped on group C2, accounted for about 20% of the total variation of days to flowering, plant height, <span class="trait">lodging</span> and nodes on the main stem, respectively.

						Superior crop cultivars must be identified through multi-environment trials (MET) and on the basis of multiple traits. The objectives of this paper were to describe two types of biplots, the GGE biplot and the GT biplot, which graphically display genotype by environment data and genotype by trait data, respectively, and hence facilitate cultivar evaluation on the basis of <span class="gene">MET</span> data and multiple traits. Genotype main effect plus genotype by environment interaction effect (GGE) biplot analysis of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">yield</span> data for the 2800 crop heat unit area of Ontario for <span class="gene">MET</span> in the period 1994-1999 revealed yearly crossover genotype by site interactions. The eastern Ontario site Winchester showed a different genotype response pattern from the three southwestern Ontario sites in four of the six years. The interactions were not large enough to divide the area into different mega-environments as when analyzed over years, a single cultivar yielded the best in all four sites. The southwestern site, St. Pauls, was found to always group together with at least one of the other three sites; it did not provide unique information on genotype performance. Therefore, in future cultivar evaluations, Winchester should always be used but St. Pauls can be dismissed. Applying GT biplot to the 1994-1999 multiple trait data illustrated that GT biplots graphically displayed the interrelationships among seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> oil content, protein content, plant height, and days to maturity, among other traits, and facilitated visual cultivar comparisons and selection. It was found that selection for seed <span class="trait">yield</span> alone was not only the simplest, but also the most effective strategy in the early stages of soybean breeding.

						The use of molecular markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) has the potential to enhance the efficiency of trait selection in plant breeding. The purpose of the present study was to identify additional QTLs for plant height, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> and maturity in a soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., population segregating for growth habit. In this study, 153 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and one morphological marker (Dt1) were used to identify QTLs associated with plant height, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> and maturity in 111 F2-derived lines from a cross of PI 97100 and 'Coker 237'. The F2-derived lines and two parents were grown at Athens, Ga., and Blackville, S.C., in 1994 and evaluated for phenotypic traits. The genetic linkage map of these 143 loci covered about 1600 cM and converged into 23 linkage groups. Eleven markers remained unlinked. Using interval-mapping analysis for linked markers and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), loci were tested for association with phenotypic data taken at each location as well as mean values over the two locations. In the combined analysis over locations, the major locus associated with plant height was identified as <span class="gene">Dt1</span> on linkage group (LG) L. The <span class="gene">Dt1</span> locus was also associated with <span class="trait">lodging.</span> This locus explained 67.7% of the total variation for plant height, and 56.4% for <span class="trait">lodging.</span> In addition, two QTLs for plant height (K007 on LG H and A516b on LG N) and one QTL for <span class="trait">lodging</span> (cr517 on LG J) were identified. For maturity, two independent QTLs were identified in intervals between R051 and N100, and between B032 and CpTI, on LG K. These QTLs explained 31.2% and 26.2% of the total variation for maturity, respectively. The same QTLs were identified for all traits at each location. This consistency of QTLs may be related to a few QTLs with large effects conditioning plant height, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> and maturity in this population.
