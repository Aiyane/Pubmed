				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and <span class="trait">leaf</span> development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted <span class="trait">leaf</span> expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved P efficiency in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and P <span class="trait">content,</span> respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P efficiency could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and <span class="trait">leaf</span> traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A potential mechanism to enhance utilization of sparingly soluble forms of <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) is the root secretion of malate, which is mainly mediated by the ALMT gene family in plants. In this study, a total of 34 <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> genes were identified in the soybean genome. Expression patterns diverged considerably among <span class="gene">GmALMTs</span> in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in leaves, roots and flowers, with expression altered by P availability in 26 of the 34 <span class="gene">GmALMTs.</span> One root-specific <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean P nutrition. Analysis of <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots. Furthermore, both growth and P <span class="trait">content</span> of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external P source. Taken together, these results indicate that members of the soybean <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> gene family exhibit diverse responses to Pi starvation. One member of this family, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> might contribute to soybean P efficiency by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble P sources under P limited conditions.
