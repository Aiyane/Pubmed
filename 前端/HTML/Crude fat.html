				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the presented study the influence of dehulling rapeseed on the composition of rapeseed meal (RM) and rapeseed cake (RC) and on its feed value for piglets and growing-finishing pigs was investigated. Before withdrawal of oil, rapeseed (variety Express) was dehulled applying a procedure developed by SKET <span class="gene">GmbH</span> Magdeburg and the Section Food-Technology of the University Essen. The steps of the dehulling procedure were described. For RM the oil was removed by the prepress-solvent procedure till a <span class="trait">crude</span> <span class="trait">fat</span> content of 2.1% in DM. RC was produced by pressing only resulting approximately 13% <span class="trait">crude</span> <span class="trait">fat</span> in DM. The RM and RC from not dehulled (ND) and dehulled (D) rapeseed were examined analytically. <span class="trait">Crude</span> nutrients, sugar and fibre substances, amino acids, some minerals and trace elements, fatty acids, glucosinolates and sinapine, and phytate were determined. By dehulling the seed the <span class="trait">crude</span> fibre content was decreased in RM and RC by approximately 40%. The ADF content declined by 35 and 39%, and the NDF content by 28% and 40% in RM and RC, respectively. The decrease in ADL content amounted to 50% and 65% for RM and RC, respectively. On the other hand, the CP content of RM and RC was increased by 7% and 13%, respectively, by dehulling the seed while the amino acid content of rape protein increased only slightly. The contents of glucosinolates and sinapine were also increased by dehulling, while the contents of phytate and phytate P were decreased. In digestibility and balance experiments with piglets and intact hybrid breeds of growing-finishing pigs, the digestibility of organic matter and of <span class="trait">crude</span> nutrients and the contents of digestible energy and metabolizable energy were estimated. Furthermore, the precaecal digestibility of <span class="trait">crude</span> nutrients and amino acids was determined with fistulated mini-pigs. By dehulling the seeds the digestibility of organic matter from RM and RC was improved in piglets and adult pigs by approximately 10%, and the ME contents increased by 13-15%. The precaecal digestibility of the sum of amino acids was increased by approximately 3 and 6 units in RM and RC, respectively. The precaecal digestibility of lysine in RM and RC reached that of soybean oil meal from not dehulled beans.
