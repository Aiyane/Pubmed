				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A peer-verified, solid-phase extraction (SPE)/anion exchange liquid chromatographic method is presented for the determination of niacin in milk-based and soy-based infant formula. Analysis is in 3 steps: test sample digestion, extraction/cleanup, and liquid chromatography (LC). Digestion uses a standard AOAC digestion procedure that involves autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 45 min in (1 + 1) H2SO4 to free endogenous niacin from protein and to convert added niacinamide to niacin. The digest solution is adjusted to pH 6.5 with 7.5M NaOH. Acidification to pH &lt;1.0 with (1 + 1) H2SO4 precipitates the protein. The clarified solution is then filtered, and the filtrate is brought to volume. SPE of niacin is accomplished by passing an aliquot of the digest solution through an aromatic sulfonic acid-SPE (ArSCX-SPE) column. After the column is washed with methanol and water to remove extraneous material, the niacin is eluted with 0.25M <span class="trait">sodium</span> acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 5.6. An anion-exchange polystyrene-divinylbenzene column with 0.1 M <span class="trait">sodium</span> acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 4.0 is used for LC. Niacin is determined by UV detection at 260 nm. A standard curve is prepared by passing known amounts of niacin through the ArSCX-SPE columns used for niacin extraction. The following values for x and relative standard deviation (RSD) were obtained for National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material (NIST SRM) 1846 Infant Formula with a certified value for niacin of 63.3 +/- 7.6 microg/g: Submitting laboratory.-- x = 59.7 +/- 4.0 microg/g; RSD = &gt;6.7%; confidence interval (CI) = +/- 1.4 microg/g; n = 27. Peer laboratory.--x = 56.6 +/- 6.6 microg/g; RSD = &gt;11.7%; <span class="gene">CI</span> =+/- 4.1 microg/g; n = 8.
