				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is the world's most important leguminous crop producing high-quality <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil. Elevating oil accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> is always many researchers' goal. WRINKLED1 (WRI1) encodes a transcription factor of the APETALA2/ethylene responsive element-binding <span class="trait">protein</span> (AP2/EREBP) family that plays important roles during plant <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation. In this study, we isolated and characterized three distinct orthologues of <span class="gene">WRI1</span> in soybean (Glycine max) that display different organ-specific expression patterns, among which <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> was highly expressed in maturing soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> was capable of binding to AW-box, a conserved sequence in the proximal upstream regions of many genes involved in various steps of oil biosynthesis. Transgenic soybean seeds overexpressing <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter showed the increased total oil and fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> and the changed fatty acid composition. Furthermore, basing on the activated expressions in transgenic soybean seeds and existence of AW-box element in the promoter regions, direct downstream genes of <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> were identified, and their products were responsible for fatty acid production, elongation, desaturation and export from plastid. We conclude that <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> transcription factor can positively regulate oil accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> by a complex gene expression network related to fatty acid biosynthesis.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Water-soluble <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> (WSPC) is a critical factor in both soybean <span class="trait">protein</span> quality and functionality. However, the underlying genetic determinants are unclear. Here, we used 219 soybean accessions and 152 recombinant inbred lines genotyped with high-density markers and phenotyped in multi-environments to dissect the genetic architectures of WSPC and <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> (PC) using single- and multi-locus genome-wide association studies. In the result, a total of 32 significant loci, including 10 novel loci, significantly associated with WSPC and PC across multi-environments were identified, which were subsequently validated by linkage mapping. Among these loci, only four exhibited pleiotropic effects for PC and WSPC, explaining the low correlation coefficient between the two traits. The largest-effect WSPC-specific loci, GqWSPC8, was stably identified across all six environments and tagged to a linkage disequilibrium block comprising two promising candidate genes AAP8 and 2 S albumin, which might contribute to the high level of WSPC in some soybean varieties. In addition, two genes, <span class="gene">Glyma.13G123500</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma.13G194400</span> with relatively high expression levels at <span class="trait">seed</span> development stage compared with other tissues were regarded as promising candidates associated with the PC and WSPC, respectively. Our results provide new insights into the genetic basis of WSPC affecting soybean <span class="trait">protein</span> quality and <span class="trait">yield.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						During ongoing proteomic analysis of the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) germplasm collection, PI 603408 was identified as a landrace whose seeds lack accumulation of one of the major <span class="trait">seed</span> storage glycinin <span class="trait">protein</span> subunits. Whole genomic resequencing was used to identify a two-base deletion affecting glycinin 5 The newly discovered deletion was confirmed to be causative through immunological, genetic, and proteomic analysis, and no significant differences in total <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> were found to be due to the glycinin 5 loss-of-function mutation per se In addition to focused studies on this one specific glycinin subunit-encoding gene, a total of 1,858,185 nucleotide variants were identified, of which 39,344 were predicted to affect <span class="trait">protein</span> coding regions. In order to semiautomate analysis of a large number of soybean gene variants, a new SIFT 4G (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerated 4 Genomes) database was designed to predict the impact of nonsynonymous single nucleotide soybean gene variants, potentially enabling more rapid analysis of soybean resequencing data in the future.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is the number one oil and <span class="trait">protein</span> crop in the United States, but the <span class="trait">seed</span> contains several anti-nutritional factors that are toxic to both humans and livestock. RNA interference technology has become an increasingly popular technique in gene silencing because it allows for both temporal and spatial targeting of specific genes. The objective of this research is to use RNA-mediated gene silencing to down-regulate the soybean gene raffinose synthase 2 (RS2), to reduce total raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> in mature <span class="trait">seed.</span> Raffinose is a trisaccharide that is indigestible to humans and monogastric animals, and as monogastric animals are the largest consumers of soy products, reducing raffinose would improve the nutritional quality of soybean. An RNAi construct targeting <span class="gene">RS2</span> was designed, cloned, and transformed to the soybean genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Resulting plants were analyzed for the presence and number of copies of the transgene by PCR and Southern blot. The efficiency of mRNA silencing was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Total raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> was determined by HPLC analysis. Transgenic plant lines were recovered that exhibited dramatically reduced levels of raffinose in mature <span class="trait">seed,</span> and these lines were further analyzed for other phenotypes such as development and <span class="trait">yield.</span> Additionally, a precision-fed rooster assay was conducted to measure the true metabolizable energy (TME) in full-fat soybean meal made from the wild-type or transgenic low-raffinose soybean lines. Transgenic low-raffinose soy had a measured TME of 2,703 kcal/kg, an increase as compared with 2,411 kcal/kg for wild-type. As low digestible energy is a major limiting factor in the percent of soybean meal that can be used in poultry diets, these results may substantiate the use of higher concentrations of low-raffinose, full-fat soy in formulated livestock diets.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Stearoyl-acyl carrier <span class="trait">protein</span> desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (Glycine max) 'Forrest' was screened to identify mutants within the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutants were identified to have high levels of <span class="trait">seed,</span> nodule, and leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid <span class="trait">content,</span> and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C.</span> Finally, we report that <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Many plants have undergone whole genome duplication (WGD). However, how regulatory networks underlying a particular trait are reshaped in polyploids has not been experimentally investigated. Here we show that the regulatory pathways modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> which involve WRINKLED1 (WRI1), LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), and LEC2 in Arabidopsis, have been modified in the palaeopolyploid soybean. Such modifications include functional reduction of <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a/GmWRI1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to WRI1, complementary non-allelic dosage effects of the <span class="gene">GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to LEC1, pseudogenization of the singleton <span class="gene">GmLEC2</span> relevant to LEC2, and the rise of the LEC2-like function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b,</span> contrasting to its homoeolog <span class="gene">GmABI3a,</span> which maintains the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)-like function in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation and dormancy. The function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b</span> in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil biosynthesis was fulfilled by direct binding to a RY (CATGCA) cis-regulatory element in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> promoter, which was absent in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> promoter, resulting in reduction of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> expression. Nevertheless, the three regulators each exhibited similar intensities of purifying selection to their respective duplicates since these pairs were formed by a WGD event that is proposed to have occurred approximately 13 million years ago (mya), suggesting that the differentiation in spatiotemporal expression between the duplicated genes is more likely to be the outcome of neutral variation in regulatory sequences. This study thus exemplifies the plasticity, dynamics, and novelty of regulatory networks mediated by WGD.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia (nitrogen (N) product of urease activity) is incorporated into organic compounds. Thus, urease is involved in N remobilization, as well as in primary N assimilation. Two urease isoforms have been described for soybean: the embryo-specific, encoded by the Eu1 gene, and the ubiquitous urease, encoded by Eu4. A third urease-encoding gene was recently identified, designated Eu5, which encodes the putative <span class="trait">protein</span> product SBU-III. The present study aimed to evaluate the contribution of soybean ureases to <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and plant development. Analyses were performed using Eu1/Eu4/Eu5-co-suppressed transgenic plants and mutants of the Eu1 and <span class="gene">Eu4</span> urease structural genes, as well as a urease-null mutant (eu3-a) that activates neither the ubiquitous nor embryo-specific ureases. The co-suppressed plants presented a developmental delay during the first month after germination; shoots and roots were significantly smaller and lighter. Slower development was observed for the double eu1-a/eu4-a mutant and the eu3-a single mutant. The N <span class="trait">content</span> in transgenic plants was significantly lower than in non-transgenic plants. Among the mutants, eu3-a presented the lowest and eu1-a the highest N <span class="trait">content.</span> Altogether, these results indicate that increased ureolytic activity plays an important role in plant development.

						BACKGROUND: Oil in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) is quantitatively the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is considered the rate-limiting enzyme for TAG accumulation. Chlorella, a unicellular eukaryotic green alga, has attracted much attention as a potential feedstock for renewable energy production. However, the function of <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> in Chlorella has not been reported. RESULTS: A full-length cDNA encoding a putative diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1, EC 2.3.1.20) was obtained from Chlorella ellipsoidea. The 2,142 bp open reading frame of this cDNA, designated CeDGAT1, encodes a <span class="trait">protein</span> of 713 amino acids showing no more than 40% identity with DGAT1s of higher plants. Transcript analysis showed that the expression level of CeDGAT1 markedly increased under nitrogen starvation, which led to significant triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. CeDGAT1 activity was confirmed in the yeast quadruple mutant strain H1246 by restoring its ability to produce TAG. Upon expression of CeDGAT1, the total fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in wild-type yeast (INVSc1) increased by 142%, significantly higher than that transformed with DGAT1s from higher plants, including even the oil crop soybean. The over-expression of CeDGAT1 under the NOS promoter in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus var. Westar significantly increased the oil <span class="trait">content</span> by 8-37% and 12-18% and the average 1,000-seed weight by 9-15% and 6-29%, respectively, but did not alter the fatty acid composition of the <span class="trait">seed</span> oil. The net increase in the 1,000-seed total lipid <span class="trait">content</span> was up to 25-50% in both transgenic Arabidopsis and B. napus. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a gene encoding <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> in C. ellipsoidea and confirmed that it plays an important role in TAG accumulation. This is the first functional analysis of <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> in Chlorella. This information is important for understanding lipid synthesis and accumulation in Chlorella and for genetic engineering to enhance oil production in microalgae and oil plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Seed</span> oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (Glycine max) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <span class="gene">GmZF351,</span> encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger <span class="trait">protein,</span> is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating WRINKLED1, BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2, 3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER <span class="trait">PROTEIN</span> SYNTHASE III, DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1, and OLEOSIN2 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation. The ZF351 haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (Glycine soja) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <span class="trait">seed</span> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> expression leads to increased <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content</span> in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.

						Plant organs, such as seeds, are primary sources of food for both humans and animals. <span class="trait">Seed</span> size is one of the major agronomic traits that have been selected in crop plants during their domestication. Legume seeds are a major source of dietary proteins and oils. Here, we report a conserved role for the BIG SEEDS1 (BS1) gene in the control of <span class="trait">seed</span> size and weight in the model legume Medicago truncatula and the grain legume soybean (Glycine max). <span class="gene">BS1</span> encodes a plant-specific transcription regulator and plays a key role in the control of the size of plant organs, including seeds, <span class="trait">seed</span> pods, and leaves, through a regulatory module that targets primary cell proliferation. Importantly, down-regulation of <span class="gene">BS1</span> orthologs in soybean by an artificial microRNA significantly increased soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> size, weight, and amino acid <span class="trait">content.</span> Our results provide a strategy for the increase in <span class="trait">yield</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> quality in legumes.

						Eleven canola <span class="trait">seed</span> (CS) samples were collected from different commercial feedmills and crushing plants in Australia and analyzed for nutrient profile. Six of these samples were selected to determine the effect of <span class="trait">seed</span> chemical composition and pellet temperature (PT) during steam pelleting on apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (AMEn) values of CS for broiler chickens using a 6 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. The CS samples were incorporated into a corn-soybean meal diet at 15% by replacing energy-yielding ingredients, and diets were steam pelleted at either 75 or 90°C. A total of 420 18-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) was assigned to 14 experimental diets replicated 6 times, with 5 chicks per cage. After a 5-day diet acclimation period from d 18 to 22, excreta were collected for 72 h using the substitution method to determine AME and AMEn. There was no interaction of <span class="trait">seed</span> source and <span class="gene">PT</span> for ileal digestible energy (IDE), AME, or AMEn values of CS (P &gt; 0.05). <span class="gene">PT</span> did not affect energy availability of CS (P &gt; 0.05) but increasing the <span class="gene">PT</span> improved the pellet durability index of the diets by approximately 5.0 percentage points. A significant effect of <span class="trait">seed</span> source was detected for all the energy utilization values of CS (P &lt; 0.05). The IDE, AME, and AMEn values of <span class="trait">seed</span> samples ranged from 5,239 to 5,645, 4,728 to 5,071, and 4,501 to 4,791 kcal/kg of DM, respectively. The mean AMEn values were 4,664 kcal/kg of DM, indicating a 5.7% reduction compared with AME values. There was a negative correlation between <span class="trait">protein</span> and fat <span class="trait">content</span> of the seeds (r = -0.93, P = 0.001), and, consequently, AMEn (r = -0.32, P = 0.009). AMEn values were positively correlated with fat <span class="trait">content</span> of CS (r = 0.649, P = 0.001). These results indicate that fat and <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and fiber components may have a considerable effect on energy availability of CS for broiler chickens.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Increasing the production of plant oils such as soybean oil as a renewable resource for food and fuel is valuable. Successful breeding for higher oil levels in soybean, however, usually results in reduced <span class="trait">protein,</span> a second valuable <span class="trait">seed</span> component. This study shows that by manipulating a highly active acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) the hydrocarbon flux to oil in oilseeds can be increased without reducing the <span class="trait">protein</span> component. Compared to other plant DGATs, a <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from Vernonia galamensis (VgDGAT1A) produces much higher oil synthesis and accumulation activity in yeast, insect cells, and soybean. Soybean lines expressing VgDGAT1A show a 4% increase in oil <span class="trait">content</span> without reductions in <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> contents or <span class="trait">yield</span> per unit land area. Incorporation of this trait into 50% of soybeans worldwide could result in an increase of 850 million kg oil/year without new land use or inputs and be worth ∼U.S.$1 billion/year at 2012 production and market prices.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds are a rich source of phenolic compounds, especially isoflavonoids, which are important nutraceuticals. Our study using 14 wild- and 16 cultivated-soybean accessions shows that seeds from cultivated soybeans generally contain lower total antioxidants compared to their wild counterparts, likely an unintended consequence of domestication or human selection. Using a recombinant inbred population resulting from a wild and a cultivated soybean parent and a bin map approach, we have identified an overlapping genomic region containing major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that regulate the <span class="trait">seed</span> contents of total antioxidants, phenolics, and flavonoids. The QTL for <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant <span class="trait">content</span> contains 14 annotated genes based on the Williams 82 reference genome <span class="gene">(Gmax1.01).</span> None of these genes encodes functions that are related to the phenylpropanoid pathway of soybean. However, we found three putative Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) transporter genes within this QTL and one adjacent to it <span class="gene">(GmMATE1-4).</span> Moreover, we have identified non-synonymous changes between <span class="gene">GmMATE1</span> and <span class="gene">GmMATE2,</span> and that <span class="gene">GmMATE3</span> encodes an antisense transcript that expresses in pods. Whether the polymorphisms in <span class="gene">GmMATE</span> proteins are major determinants of the antioxidant contents, or whether the antisense transcripts of <span class="gene">GmMATE3</span> play important regulatory roles, awaits further functional investigations.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Next-generation sequencing-based studies have provided solid evidence to support that wild soybeans are important genetic resources for crop improvement ( <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> Kim et al., 2010 </xref> ; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> Lam et al., 2010 </xref> ; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr"> Zhou et al., 2015 </xref> ). Using a recombinant inbred (RI) population built from the cross between a wild and a cultivated soybean parent, our previous study has identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) regulating <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant contents on chromosome 19 ( <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> Qi et al., 2014 </xref> ). This QTL does not overlap with the QTL controlling <span class="trait">seed</span> coat color and anthocyanin <span class="trait">content</span> ( <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> Qi et al., 2014 </xref> ), suggesting that the high <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant activities in wild soybeans are not a direct result of high anthocyanin contents in their <span class="trait">seed</span> coats. Moreover, this QTL is also distinct from the genistein and total isoflavone QTL region on chromosome 19, which contains a phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL)-encoding gene ( <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> Gutierrez-Gonzalez et al., 2010b </xref> ). <span class="gene">PAL</span> catalyzes the committing step in the phenolic and flavonoid synthesizing phenylpropanoid pathway ( <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> Reinprecht et al., 2013 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, we investigated the relationships between total <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant contents, <span class="trait">seed</span> phenolic contents, and <span class="trait">seed</span> flavonoid contents in hulled seeds of the RI population, and found one genomic region covering all three QTLs. Upon further analyses to refine this genomic region, several <italic> <underline> M </underline> ultidrug <underline> A </underline> nd <underline> T </underline> oxic Compound <underline> E </underline> xtrusion </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">MATE</span> </italic> ) genes controlling the transportation of secondary compounds were identified therein.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The QTL region of <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant contents overlaps with both the QTLs of <span class="trait">seed</span> phenolic contents and <span class="trait">seed</span> flavonoid contents. It contains 14 annotated gene loci based on the Williams 82 reference genome <span class="gene">(Gmax1.01).</span> None of the genes encode functions that are related to the phenylpropanoid pathway of soybean ( <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> Reinprecht et al., 2013 </xref> ), the essential metabolic pathway for synthesizing phenolics and flavonoids. However, there are three putative <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporter genes found within this QTL region ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma19g29860</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma19g29870</span> </italic> , and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma19g29940</span> </italic> ) and one adjacent to this QTL ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma19g29970</span> </italic> ). We named the four putative <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporter genes <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE1-4</span> </italic> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"> S3 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phylogenetic analyses of the predicted <span class="trait">protein</span> sequences of <span class="gene">GmMATE1-4</span> with published <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters of known substrates showed that they cluster with other flavonoid-transporting <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> </bold> ). However, none of the 4 <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters in the antioxidant contents QTL are direct orthologs of known flavonoid-transporting <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters such as AtTT12 and SlMTP77. Instead, <span class="gene">GmMATE1-4</span> forms a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To determine if there are any differences in the 4 <italic> <span class="gene">MATE</span> </italic> genes from W05 versus C08, expression studies and sequence analyses were performed. RT-qPCR studies showed that <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE1</span> </italic> expression is up-regulated in the pod and <span class="trait">seed</span> ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> </bold> ). <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE2</span> </italic> is generally expressed in all tissue types except in the <span class="trait">seed</span> ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> </bold> ). <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE4</span> </italic> is expressed in all tissue types, but with higher expression levels in old pods ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> </bold> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Within the 208-kb antioxidant QTL locus, there are about 14 gene loci in the Williams 82 reference genome. None of these were predicted as part of the phenylpropanoid pathway ( <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"> Reinprecht et al., 2013 </xref> ), which corresponds to the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Instead, there are <span class="gene">MATE</span> protein-encoding genes located within, or in close proximity to, this QTL region. <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters have been found to mediate the transportation of various molecules in plant, ranging from metal ions to biomolecules. Some of them are involved in phenolics transportation. For example, AtTT12 from <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> and MtMATE1 from Medicago are vacuolar flavonoid/H <sup> + </sup> antiporter, preferentially transporting epicatechin 3&#x02032;-O-glucoside for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> Marinova et al., 2007 </xref> ; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"> Zhao and Dixon, 2009 </xref> ). SlMTP77 from tomato, MtMATE2 from Medicago and VvAM1 and anthoVvAM3 from grapevine are involved in anthocyanin transportation ( <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> Mathews et al., 2003 </xref> ; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> Gomez et al., 2009 </xref> ; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr"> Zhao et al., 2011 </xref> ). In our phylogenetic study here using other published <span class="gene">MATE</span> proteins, <span class="gene">GmMATE1-4</span> are clustered with flavonoid-transporting <span class="gene">MATE</span> proteins, suggesting that they may transport flavonoid-related compounds.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						While there is no known phenolic compound or flavonoid biosynthetic genes involved in the antioxidant locus, the presence of the four <span class="gene">MATE</span> protein-encoding genes infers that soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant contents may not be limited by biosynthesis but by transportation or accumulation. On the other hand, in our previous study, we have discovered that the <span class="trait">seed</span> antioxidant <span class="trait">content</span> is correlated with the mature pod color ( <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> Qi et al., 2014 </xref> ). It has been reported that many secondary plant compounds are transported from their sites of synthesis to the sites of accumulation ( <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> Dhaubhadel, 2011 </xref> ). It has been demonstrated that although the soybean embryo has the ability to synthesize flavonoids, the synthesis in maternal tissues may contribute significantly to the total accumulation in sink organs such as seeds at maturity ( <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> Dhaubhadel et al., 2003 </xref> ). However, how flavonoids or their precursors are transported between tissues remains unclear. Interestingly, our <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporters expression data support the idea that they could be involved in flavonoids or precursors transportation between tissues. Expression patterns of <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE1</span> </italic> , <italic> 2 </italic> , and <italic> 4 </italic> show high expression levels at 60 DAF with a matching gradual increase during pod development and <span class="trait">seed</span> filling.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A previous study suggested that two non-synonymous amino acid changes (N116S and L117P) are sufficient to abrogate citrate transportation by a <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporter AtFRD3 ( <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> Pineau et al., 2012 </xref> ) ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4C </xref> </bold> ). Interestingly, a similar type of substitution can be found in <span class="gene">GmMATE1</span> (N330S) and <span class="gene">GmMATE2</span> (N483S) ( <bold> Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"> 4A,B </xref> </bold> ). Plants have a large number of <span class="gene">MATE</span> genes, in contrast to a relatively small number in bacteria and animals ( <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> Omote et al., 2006 </xref> ). It is fascinating why these transporters have diversified in plants and why they are able to transport a large variety of compounds. In this context, based on our results and previous studies ( <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> Pineau et al., 2012 </xref> ), we speculate that amino acid substitutions could contribute to the changes in <span class="trait">protein</span> activities or transport specificities.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Quantitative trait loci corresponding to high antioxidant contents, high total phenolics and high total flavonoids in the wild soybean, W05, were mapped to the same position on chromosome 19. This genomic region may be linked to domestication or the improvement of soybean. Hence, more efforts will be needed to investigate the potential of using this QTL to help improve the antioxidant contents in cultivated soybean. On the other hand, 4 <span class="gene">MATE</span> transporter-encoding genes were found within and adjacent to this locus, suggesting that the high antioxidant <span class="trait">content</span> in wild soybean seeds could be related to intercellular phenolic compounds transportation. Non-synonymous changes were identified in <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE1</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE2</span> </italic> , while <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE3</span> </italic> encodes an antisense transcript that is expressed in pods. Whether the polymorphisms in <span class="gene">GmMATE</span> proteins are a major determinant of the antioxidant contents, and whether the antisense transcript of <italic> <span class="gene">GmMATE3</span> </italic> plays an important regulatory role, await further functional investigations.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Kinetically improved diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) variants were created to favorably alter carbon partitioning in soybean (Glycine max) seeds. Initially, variants of a type 1 <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from a high-oil, high-oleic acid plant <span class="trait">seed,</span> Corylus americana, were screened for high oil <span class="trait">content</span> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nearly all <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants examined from high-oil strains had increased affinity for oleoyl-CoA, with S0.5 values decreased as much as 4.7-fold compared with the wild-type value of 0.94 µm Improved soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants were then designed to include amino acid substitutions observed in promising C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants. The expression of soybean and C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants in soybean somatic embryos resulted in oil contents as high as 10% and 12%, respectively, compared with only 5% and 7.6% oil achieved by overexpressing the corresponding wild-type DGATs. The affinity for oleoyl-CoA correlated strongly with oil <span class="trait">content.</span> The soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variant that gave the greatest oil increase contained 14 amino acid substitutions out of a total of 504 (97% sequence identity with native). Seed-preferred expression of this soybean <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> variant increased oil <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean seeds by an average of 3% (16% relative increase) in highly replicated, single-location field trials. The <span class="gene">DGAT</span> transgenes significantly reduced the soluble carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of mature seeds and increased the <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of some events. This study demonstrated that engineering of the native <span class="gene">DGAT</span> enzyme is an effective strategy to improve the oil <span class="trait">content</span> and value of soybeans.

						KEY MESSAGE: Identification and characterization of a 254-kb genomic deletion on a duplicated chromosome segment that resulted in a low level of palmitic acid in soybean seeds using transcriptome sequencing. A large number of soybean genotypes varying in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil composition and <span class="trait">content</span> have been identified. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these variations is important for breeders to effectively utilize them as a genetic resource. Through design and application of a bioinformatics approach, we identified nine co-regulated gene clusters by comparing <span class="trait">seed</span> transcriptomes of nine soybean genotypes varying in oil composition and <span class="trait">content.</span> We demonstrated that four gene clusters in the genotypes M23, Jack and N0304-303-3 coincided with large-scale genome rearrangements. The co-regulated gene clusters in M23 and Jack mapped to a previously described 164-kb deletion and a copy number amplification of the <span class="gene">Rhg1</span> locus, respectively. The coordinately down-regulated gene clusters in N0304-303-3 were caused by a 254-kb deletion containing 19 genes including a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B gene (FATB1a). This deletion was associated with reduced palmitic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds and was the molecular cause of a previously reported nonfunctional <span class="gene">FATB1a</span> allele, fap nc . The M23 and N0304-304-3 deletions were located in duplicated genome segments retained from the Glycine-specific whole genome duplication that occurred 13 million years ago. The homoeologous genes in these duplicated regions shared a strong similarity in both their encoded <span class="trait">protein</span> sequences and transcript accumulation levels, suggesting that they may have conserved and important functions in seeds. The functional conservation of homoeologous genes may result in genetic redundancy and gene dosage effects for their associated <span class="trait">seed</span> traits, explaining why the large deletion did not cause lethal effects or completely eliminate palmitic acid in N0304-303-3.

						Compared to β-conglycinin, glycinin contains 3-4 times the methionine and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage <span class="trait">protein</span> in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the glycinin and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for glycinin (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of glycinin and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of glycinin. These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The allocation of carbon and nitrogen resources to the synthesis of plant proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids is complex and under the control of many genes; much remains to be understood about this process. <span class="gene">QQS</span> (Qua-Quine Starch; At3g30720), an orphan gene unique to Arabidopsis thaliana, regulates metabolic processes affecting carbon and nitrogen partitioning among proteins and carbohydrates, modulating leaf and <span class="trait">seed</span> composition in Arabidopsis and soybean. Here the universality of <span class="gene">QQS</span> function in modulating carbon and nitrogen allocation is exemplified by a series of transgenic experiments. We show that ectopic expression of <span class="gene">QQS</span> increases soybean <span class="trait">protein</span> independent of the genetic background and original <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of the cultivar. Furthermore, transgenic <span class="gene">QQS</span> expression increases the <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of maize, a <span class="gene">C4</span> species (a species that uses 4-carbon photosynthesis), and rice, a protein-poor agronomic crop, both highly divergent from Arabidopsis. We determine that <span class="gene">QQS</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> binds to the transcriptional regulator AtNF-YC4 (Arabidopsis nuclear factor Y, subunit C4). Overexpression of AtNF-YC4 in Arabidopsis mimics the QQS-overexpression phenotype, increasing <span class="trait">protein</span> and decreasing starch levels. NF-YC, a component of the NF-Y complex, is conserved across eukaryotes. The NF-YC4 homologs of soybean, rice, and maize also bind to QQS, which provides an explanation of how <span class="gene">QQS</span> can act in species where it does not occur endogenously. These findings are, to our knowledge, the first insight into the mechanism of action of <span class="gene">QQS</span> in modulating carbon and nitrogen allocation across species. They have major implications for the emergence and function of orphan genes, and identify a nontransgenic strategy for modulating <span class="trait">protein</span> levels in crop species, a trait of great agronomic significance.

						Microsomal omega-6 fatty acid desaturase (FAD2-1B) is an enzyme that regulates the polyunsaturated fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybeans (Glycine max). In this study, the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> gene was determined to be highly expressed in soybean seeds using quantitative real-time PCR(qRT-PCR). To investigate the expression pattern and activity of the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> promoter, a 1929 bp 5'-upstream genomic DNA fragment, named PF, was isolated according to the soybean genomic sequence. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of many motifs related to seed-specific promoters in the PF fragment, such as E-box, SEF4, Skn-1 motif, AACACA, AATAAA and so on. Tobacco transgenics carrying the gus reporter gene driven by the PF and/or 35S promoters were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR. qRT-PCR and histochemical GUS assays showed that the PF promoter could regulate gus gene accumulation in seeds and the expression level was higher than in other organs. In the meantime, it exhibited similar activity to the 35S promoter in seeds, which could be associated with seed-related cis-elements found in the 1-248 bp, 451-932 bp, and 1627-1803 bp regions of the promoter.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Hardness of cooked soybeans [Glycine max (L). Merr.] is an important attribute in food processing. We found one candidate gene, <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> to be associated with the hardness of cotyledons of cooked soybeans, based on a quantitative trait locus and fine-scale mapping analyses using a recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between two Japanese cultivars, "Natto-shoryu" and "Hyoukei-kuro 3". Analysis of the DNA sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> a pectin methylesterase gene homologue, revealed three patterns of mutations, two of which result in truncated proteins and one of which results in an amino acid substitution. The truncated proteins are presumed to lack the enzymatic activity of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> We classified 24 cultivars into four groups based on the sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> The texture analysis using the 22 cultivars grown in different locations indicated that <span class="trait">protein</span> truncation of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360</span> resulted in softer cotyledons of cooked soybeans, which was further confirmed by texture analysis performed using F2 populations of a cross between "Enrei" and "LD00-3309", and between "Satonohohoemi" and "Sakukei 98". A positive correlation between hardness and calcium <span class="trait">content</span> implies the possible effect of calcium binding to pectins on the hardness of cooked soybean cotyledons.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds were exposed to gamma radiation (0.5, 1, 3 and 5 kGy), static magnetic field (50, 100 and 200 mT) and a combination of gamma radiation and magnetic energy (0.5 kGy + 200 mT and 5 kGy + 50 mT) and stored at room temperature for six months. These seeds were later subjected to accelerated ageing treatment at 42 °C temperature and 95-100 % relative humidity and were compared for various physical and biochemical characteristics between the untreated and the energized treatments. Energy treatment protected the quality of stored seeds in terms of its <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil <span class="trait">content</span> . Accelerated aging conditions, however, affected the oil and <span class="trait">protein</span> quantity and quality of <span class="trait">seed</span> negatively. Antioxidant enzymes exhibited a decline in their activity during aging while the <span class="gene">LOX</span> activity, which reflects the rate of lipid peroxidation, in general, increased during the aging. Gamma irradiated (3 and 5 kGy) and magnetic field treated seeds (100 and 200 mT) maintained a higher catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity which may help in efficient scavenging of deleterious free radical produced during the aging. Aging caused peroxidative changes to lipids, which could be contributed to the loss of oil quality. Among the electromagnetic energy treatments, a dose of 1-5 kGy of gamma and 100 mT, 200 mT magnetic field effectively slowed the rate of biochemical degradation and loss of cellular integrity in seeds stored under conditions of accelerated aging and thus, protected the deterioration of <span class="trait">seed</span> quality. Energy combination treatments did not <span class="trait">yield</span> any additional protection advantage.

						KEY MESSAGE: We identified and characterized a mutant of soybean stachyose synthase gene controlling reduced stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> which benefit the soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> composition breeding program in the future. It has been shown that in soybean, increased sucrose and reduced raffinose family oligosaccharides would have a positive impact on the world's feed industry by improving digestibility and feed efficiency. We searched for new sources of modified oligosaccharide <span class="trait">content</span> in a subset of the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection and then identified plant introduction (PI) 603176A as having ultra-low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> (0.5%). We identified a 33-bp deletion mutant in the putative stachyose synthase gene (STS gene, <span class="gene">Glyma19g40550)</span> of PI 603176A. A co-dominate indel marker was successfully developed from this 33-bp deletion area and was genetically mapped into two F 2:3 populations and a F 4:5 population, which associated with low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in the progeny lines. These observations provided strong evidence that the <span class="gene">STS</span> gene is responsible for stachyose biosynthesis in the soybean plant. Expression of the sts gene remained at the normal level, suggesting the loss of function in the gene is due to defective <span class="trait">protein</span> function. This gene-based perfect genetic marker for low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> can be useful for marker-assisted selection in soybean molecular breeding programs.

						The reduction in oligosaccharide levels in soybean meal could increase the amount of soy proteins in rations (Hartwig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7"> 1997 </xref> ). In past years, many efforts have been made to evaluate existing soybean germplasm and mutagenized materials aiming for the improvement of digestible carbohydrates and better nutritional factors. Sebastian et al. ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102"> 2000 </xref> ) screened bulk <span class="trait">seed</span> from approximately 8000 individual M3 generation plants and the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection, and identified two types of modified carbohydrate profile soybean seeds. Soybean accession PI 200508 was identified as having reduced levels of RFOs and elevated levels of sucrose (Kerr and Sebastian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"> 2000 </xref> ). Initial characterization of this PI was carried out by Hitz et al. ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"> 2002 </xref> ). Later, it was reported that PI 200508 allele of <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> (raffinose synthase) was associated with the increased sucrose and low raffinose and stachyose <span class="trait">seed</span> phenotype (Dierking and Bilyeu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 2008 </xref> ; Skoneczka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20"> 2009 </xref> ). The intellectual property of the above soybean line limits the development of these traits in public breeding programs.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A total of 650 soybean accessions (from MG III to V) were screened for natural variation of <span class="trait">seed</span> sugar components. The frequency distribution of <span class="trait">seed</span> raffinose and stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> for 650 accessions are shown in Supplement S1. The initial screening identified a few lines with low raffinose and low stachyose <span class="trait">content.</span> Those lines were planted in different environments for the stability test. Subsequently, the lines with low raffinose and low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in more than two environments were selected for further genetic analysis (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> ). PI 603176A showed a significant reduction in stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> from 5 to 0.5&#x000a0;% in different environments. Three genetic populations derived from this PI line were developed for genetic analysis and gene mapping. <table-wrap id="Tab1"> <label> Table&#x000a0;1 </label> <caption> <p> <span class="trait">Seed</span> RFO <span class="trait">content</span> and non-synonymous SNPs variation in RS2, RS3, RS4, and <span class="gene">STS</span> genes in the selected soybean lines

						The stachyose synthase gene ( <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma19g40550</span> </italic> ) is a putative gene involved in a pathway which converts raffinose to stachyose. Besides that, the genes <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g18890</span> </italic> ), <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma05g08950</span> </italic> ), and <italic> RS4 </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma05g02510</span> </italic> ) were confirmed to be involved with the raffinose metabolism. We have sequenced these four genes in PI 603176A along with other lines (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> ). A number of SNP variations were identified in these four genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> ). Interestingly, the sequence of the <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene in PI 603176A showed that there is a 33-bp deletion in the exon 4 of this gene compared to an elite line S07-5049, which caused the 11 amino acid deletion in the <span class="trait">protein</span> (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1 </xref> ). <fig id="Fig1"> <label> Fig.&#x000a0;1 </label> <caption> <p> A 33-bp deletion in the 4th exon of PI 603176A stachyose synthase gene
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We also identified new non-synonymous SNPs, such as G2000T and C2123A in gene <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> , C197G in gene <italic> RS4 </italic> , T1895A and T2558G in <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene, which caused the amino acid changes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> ). The PI 594012 showed second lowest stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> at 2.89&#x000a0;% among the 650 germplasm accessions evaluated in this study. There were three non-synonymous SNPs in the <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> genes and one non-synonymous SNP in <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene of PI 594012. In addition, two other PI lines, PI 424079 and PI 437654, also showed the lowest raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> with the various non-synonymous SNPs in these four genes. Further genetic analysis is needed for the functional confirmation of these SNP variation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Statistical analysis of phenotypic data in the S07-5049&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;PI 603176A population showed that a single gene plays key role in a pathway of raffinose to stachyose. We developed this deletion ( <italic> sts </italic> genotype) into the Allele-Specific molecular marker assay (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig"> 3 </xref> ). The marker assay data from <italic> F </italic> <sub> 2:3 </sub> plants for both candidate genes and data sets revealed 1:2:1 ratio ( <italic> P </italic> &#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) for PI 603176A alleles ( <italic> sts </italic> / <italic> sts </italic> ): heterozygote ( <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> / <italic> sts </italic> ): S07-5049 alleles ( <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> / <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> ) (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> ). The association analysis of phenotypic data of raffinose and stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> and genotypic data determined a strong association of the RFOs <span class="trait">content</span> and the <italic> sts </italic> genotype. A significant positive correlation ( <italic> r </italic> <sup> 2 </sup> &#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.89, <italic> P </italic> &#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) was observed between stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> and the <italic> sts </italic> genotype. In contrast, a significant negative correlation ( <italic> r </italic> <sup> 2 </sup> &#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;0.86, <italic> P </italic> &#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) was observed between raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> and the <italic> sts </italic> genotype. Results confirmed the biochemical function of <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene in converting raffinose into stachyose. The functional <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene in S07-5049 converts raffinose into stachyose and causes low raffinose and high stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in regular soybean seeds. The <italic> sts </italic> mutant in PI 603176A resulted in the seed&#x02019;s inability to convert raffinose to stachyose and the accumulation of raffinose <span class="trait">content,</span> which as same as in the progeny lines. <fig id="Fig3"> <label> Fig.&#x000a0;3 </label> <caption> <p> SimpleProbe marker assays were developed based on a 33-bp deletion associated with low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in the S07-5049&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;PI 603176A population. The homozygous <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> genotype gives the peaks at 79&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and the homozygous <italic> sts </italic> genotype gives the peaks at 75.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Heterozygotes, <italic> STS/sts </italic> , show both peaks
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Expression of the <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene was determined using quantitative RT-PCR in cv. Williams 82, S07-5049, and PI 603176A. Leaf tissue from these three parental lines was collected at the vegetative stage V1, reproductive stages R1, and R5 growth stages and <span class="trait">seed</span> tissue was collected at the R5 and R6 growth stages (Fehr and Caviness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6"> 1977 </xref> ). The results indicated that the putative stachyose synthase genes have similar transcript levels in the three parental lines when compared to the housekeeping gene, elongation factor 1&#x003b1; (Czechowski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3"> 2005 </xref> ). There is a slight increase of expression in sts genes of PI 603176A from the <span class="gene">V1</span> to R6 growth stage (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig"> 4 </xref> ). Both <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> and <italic> sts </italic> genes do not appear to be tissue specific or highly expressed in the developing <span class="trait">seed</span> tissues. Similar transcript levels as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, for <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> and <italic> sts </italic> , and for all three lines, indicated that the difference in oligosaccharide <span class="trait">content</span> was unlikely to be a product of disruption in the transcriptional machinery, but rather a functional loss of <span class="trait">protein.</span> <fig id="Fig4"> <label> Fig.&#x000a0;4 </label> <caption> <p> Relative expression of <span class="gene">STS</span> gene at different stages in cv.

						Both <italic> RS </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> genes contain the same Pfam structure, PF05691 (Raffinose_synthase). Based on the EMBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) data base, 136 Eukaryote, 53 Bacteria and 21 Archaea species shared the PF05691 structure domain. About 101 <italic> RS </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> <span class="trait">protein</span> sequences from 43 plant genomes were selected to generate phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ). The soybean <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> genes shared highest amino acid similarity with <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> genes compared to species <italic> Phaseolus vulgaris </italic> and <italic> Vigna angularis </italic> at 87&#x000a0;%, following a similarity of 78&#x000a0;% in <italic> Cicer arietinum </italic> and <italic> Medicago truncatula </italic> . It is not surprising that the soybean <italic> RS </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> genes were grouped into different subclades due to only 45&#x000a0;% amino acid similarities between them. The sequence identity for soybean <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> is 65&#x000a0;%, for <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> and <italic> RS4 </italic> is 70&#x000a0;%, and for <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> and <italic> RS4 </italic> it is 62&#x000a0;% at the amino acid level, which is shown in the phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ). <fig id="Fig5"> <label> Fig.&#x000a0;5 </label> <caption> <p> Phylogenetic relationships of 101 RS and <span class="gene">STS</span> proteins in 45 plant genomes using Bayesian analysis.

						We have successfully identified a 33-bp deletion mutant in the putative soybean stachyose synthase ( <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> ) gene, characterized their expression in multiple tissues, developed and characterized the phenotype&#x02013;genotype association in three segregating genetic populations. We confirmed the function of <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene, which can convert raffinose into stachyose as part of raffinose metabolism (Dierking and Bilyeu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 2008 </xref> ; Skoneczka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20"> 2009 </xref> ). The <italic> sts </italic> mutant cut off the conversion of raffinose to stachyose, which caused a 90&#x000a0;% reduction of stachyose and the accumulation of raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds. These data provided strong evidence that the <italic> <span class="gene">STS</span> </italic> gene was responsible for stachyose biosynthesis in the soybean plant. The <italic> sts </italic> genotype was always associated with low stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> (0.5&#x000a0;%), showing a significant reduction from regular stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> (5&#x000a0;%). This <italic> sts </italic> genotype mutant from PI 603176A associated with the low <span class="trait">seed</span> stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> was also confirmed in different progeny lines from three genetic populations which under different growing environments.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						So far, the <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> mutant allele from PI 200508 was the main source for the selection of low raffinose and stachyose <span class="trait">seed</span> phenotype in soybean (Dierking and Bilyeu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 2008 </xref> ). Typically, the <span class="trait">seed</span> raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> of the <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> allele remains at a regular level of 1&#x000a0;%, but the stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> drops to 1.5&#x000a0;%. It was reported that a soybean line, 222-18-1, exhibited ultra-low raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> (0.13&#x000a0;%) and stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> (0.58&#x000a0;%), and in which the <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> allele was combined with other <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> and <italic> RS4 </italic> mutant alleles (Schillinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19"> 2011 </xref> ). This might suggest the <italic> <span class="gene">RS2</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> , and <italic> RS4 </italic> alleles are three main enzymes responsible for converting galactinol into raffinose; however, the function of <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> and <italic> RS4 </italic> are still unknown. The <italic> sts </italic> mutant allele in our study causes only at a level of 0.5&#x000a0;% stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in <span class="trait">seed.</span> The <italic> sts </italic> genes are highly expressed in both leaf and developing seeds, which indicated that the 11-amino acids deletion might cause a functional loss of <span class="trait">protein.</span> There was still a production of 0.5&#x000a0;% stachyose <span class="trait">content</span> in the mutant. We speculate that this was possibly due to a partial function of the <italic> sts </italic> mutant or from the functional alleles of <italic> <span class="gene">RS3</span> </italic> and <italic> RS4 </italic> .

						BACKGROUND: SWEET (MtN3_saliva) domain proteins, a recently identified group of efflux transporters, play an indispensable role in sugar efflux, phloem loading, plant-pathogen interaction and reproductive tissue development. The SWEET gene family is predominantly studied in Arabidopsis and members of the family are being investigated in rice. To date, no transcriptome or genomics analysis of soybean SWEET genes has been reported. RESULTS: In the present investigation, we explored the evolutionary aspect of the SWEET gene family in diverse plant species including primitive single cell algae to angiosperms with a major emphasis on Glycine max. Evolutionary features showed expansion and duplication of the SWEET gene family in land plants. Homology searches with BLAST tools and Hidden Markov Model-directed sequence alignments identified 52 SWEET genes that were mapped to 15 chromosomes in the soybean genome as tandem duplication events. Soybean SWEET <span class="gene">(GmSWEET)</span> genes showed a wide range of expression profiles in different tissues and developmental stages. Analysis of public transcriptome data and expression profiling using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that a majority of the <span class="gene">GmSWEET</span> genes were confined to reproductive tissue development. Several natural genetic variants (non-synonymous SNPs, premature stop codons and haplotype) were identified in the <span class="gene">GmSWEET</span> genes using whole genome re-sequencing data analysis of 106 soybean genotypes. A significant association was observed between SNP-haplogroup and <span class="trait">seed</span> sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> in three gene clusters on chromosome 6. CONCLUSION: Present investigation utilized comparative genomics, transcriptome profiling and whole genome re-sequencing approaches and provided a systematic description of soybean SWEET genes and identified putative candidates with probable roles in the reproductive tissue development. Gene expression profiling at different developmental stages and genomic variation data will aid as an important resource for the soybean research community and can be extremely valuable for understanding sink unloading and enhancing carbohydrate delivery to developing seeds for improving <span class="trait">yield.</span>

						BACKGROUND: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) can be synthesised by the GABA shunt and polyamine degradation pathway in plants under hypoxia stress and lower temperature. The hypoxia germination freeze-thawing incubation was used as a new technique for accumulating more GABA in soybean. RESULTS: Results showed that glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and diamine oxidase (DAO) activity as well as GABA <span class="trait">content</span> increased during germination within 24 h under hypoxia. However, the contents of dry matters and <span class="trait">protein</span> decreased. When the hypoxia-treated sprouts were frozen at -18 °C for 12 h and thawed at 25 °C for 6 h, GABA <span class="trait">content</span> increased drastically to 7.21-fold of the non-frozen sprouts. Subsequently, the freeze-thawing sprouts were ground into homogenates and incubated. GABA <span class="trait">content</span> was 14.20-fold of the only-soaked seeds when homogenates was incubated at 45 °C for 80 min within 400 µmol L(-1) pyridoxine (VB6) (pH 6.5). CONCLUSION: The hypoxia germination freeze-thawing incubation was an effective method for accumulating GABA in soybean. During incubation, <span class="gene">DAO</span> was more important for GABA formation in homogenate of germinated soybean compared with GAD.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Loss of seed-coat impermeability was essential in the domestication of many leguminous crops to promote the production of their highly nutritious seeds. Here we show that seed-coat impermeability in wild soybean is controlled by a single gene, <span class="gene">GmHs1-1,</span> which encodes a calcineurin-like metallophosphoesterase transmembrane <span class="trait">protein.</span> <span class="gene">GmHs1-1</span> is primarily expressed in the Malpighian layer of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat and is associated with calcium <span class="trait">content.</span> The transition from impermeability to permeability in domesticated soybean was caused by artificial selection of a point mutation in <span class="gene">GmHs1-1.</span> Interestingly, a number of soybean landraces evaded selection for permeability because of an alternative selection for seed-coat cracking that also enables <span class="trait">seed</span> imbibition. Despite the single origin of the mutant allele <span class="gene">Gmhs1-1,</span> the distribution pattern of allelic variants in the context of soybean population structure and the detected signature of genomic introgression between wild and cultivated soybeans suggest that <span class="gene">Gmhs1-1</span> may have experienced reselection for seed-coat permeability.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy <span class="trait">protein</span> is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the acidic (A) polypeptides of glycinin, basic (B) polypeptides of glycinin, and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in glycinin (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of glycinin and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in glycinin subunit, and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in glycinin subunit when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in glycinin subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The nutritional benefits of soybean remain underutilized as the off-flavor present in it limits the consumption and acceptability among people. The aim of the present study was to unveil the effect of the phytohormones methyl jasmonate (MJ: 0, 50 μM, 1 mM, and 15 mM) and salicylic acid (SA: 0, 50 μM, 0.1 mM, and 10 mM) as elicitors on two contrasting off-flavor soybean varieties at different growth stages (1, bloom; 2, pod development; 3, <span class="trait">seed</span> development). The effects of two elicitors varied widely and were found to be dose dependent and growth stage independent. SA reduces the lipoxygenase (LOX) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) activity, which in turn resulted in reduction in the TBA number and carbonyl value in contrast to MJ. SA 0.1 mM is the most effective dose in reduction of off-flavor determining parameters and <span class="trait">protein</span> oxidation, and it reduces the <span class="gene">LOX</span> and <span class="gene">HPL</span> activity by 2.3- and 2.4-fold, respectively in "high off-flavor" cultivar 'Bragg' compared to "low off-flavor" cultivar 'DS 2706' which showed 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively. This reduction in <span class="trait">protein</span> oxidation is also supported by enhanced <span class="trait">content</span> of antioxidant enzymes. Thus, phytohormone SA can be used in reduction of off-flavor generation, more effectively than MJ treatments, in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soya bean (Glycine max) plants overexpressing a seed-specific bacterial phytoene synthase gene from Pantoea ananatis modified to target to plastids accumulated 845 μg β carotene g(-1) dry <span class="trait">seed</span> weight with a desirable 12:1 ratio of β to α. The β carotene accumulating seeds exhibited a shift in oil composition increasing oleic acid with a concomitant decrease in linoleic acid and an increase in <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> by at least 4% (w/w). Elevated β-carotene accumulating soya bean cotyledons contain 40% the amount of abscisic acid compared to nontransgenic cotyledons. Proteomic and nontargeted metabolomic analysis of the mid-maturation β-carotene cotyledons compared to the nontransgenic did not reveal any significant differences that would account for the altered phenotypes of both elevated oleate and <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> Transcriptomic analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR, revealed a number of significant differences in ABA-responsive transcripton factor gene expression in the <span class="gene">crtB</span> transgenics compared to nontransgenic cotyledons of the same maturation stage. The altered <span class="trait">seed</span> composition traits seem to be attributed to altered ABA hormone levels varying transcription factor expression. The elevated β-carotene, oleic acid and <span class="trait">protein</span> traits in the β-carotene soya beans confer a substantial additive nutritional quality to soya beans.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) seeds are the primary source of edible oil in the United States. Despite its widespread utility, soybean oil is oxidatively unstable. Until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent chemical hydrogenation, a process which also generates trans fats. An alternative to chemical hydrogenation is genetic modification of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil through identification and introgression of mutant alleles. One target for improvement is the elevation of a saturated fat with no negative cardiovascular impacts, stearic acid, which typically constitutes a minute portion of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil (~3%). RESULTS: We examined radiation induced soybean mutants with moderately increased stearic acid (10-15% of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil, ~3-5 X the levels in wild-type soybean seeds) via comparative whole genome hybridization and genetic analysis. The deletion of one <span class="gene">SACPD</span> isoform encoding gene (SACPD-C) was perfectly correlated with moderate elevation of <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> However, <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion lines were also found to have altered nodule fatty acid composition and grossly altered morphology. Despite these defects, overall nodule accumulation and nitrogen fixation were unaffected, at least under laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Although no <span class="trait">yield</span> penalty has been reported for moderate elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds, our results demonstrate that genetic alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> traits can have unforeseen pleiotropic consequences. We have identified a role for fatty acid biosynthesis, and <span class="gene">SACPD</span> activity in particular, in the establishment and maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean oil has a wide variety of uses, and stearic acid, which is a relatively minor component of soybean oil is increasingly desired for both industrial and food applications. New soybean mutants containing high levels of the saturated fatty acid stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate <span class="trait">content</span> from 6-14% stearic acid, which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type <span class="trait">seed</span> of the Williams 82 cultivar. Candidate gene sequencing revealed that all of these lines carried amino acid substitutions in the gene encoding the delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier <span class="trait">protein</span> desaturase enzyme (SACPD-C) required for the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid. Five of these missense mutations were in highly conserved residues clustered around the predicted di-iron center of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> enzyme. Co-segregation analysis demonstrated a positive association of the elevated stearate trait with the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutation for three populations. These missense mutations may provide additional alleles that may be used in the development of new soybean cultivars with increased levels of stearic acid.

						BACKGROUND: Variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil composition and <span class="trait">content</span> among soybean varieties is largely attributed to differences in transcript sequences and/or transcript accumulation of oil production related genes in seeds. Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. RESULTS: In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil <span class="trait">content.</span> Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded <span class="trait">protein</span> sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, soy proteins were reduced with 0.1-10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to obtain an increasing number of sulphydryl groups (SH) with a similar particle size. Aggregation was promoted by increasing the degree of reduction when heated (100°C, 30min), resulting in larger sized aggregates (from 40 to 70nm) and a higher viscosity of the aggregate dispersion. The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of acidic (A) polypeptide of glycinin, basic (B) polypeptides of glycinin, and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation. The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of glycinin and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on <span class="trait">protein</span> aggregates formation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean peroxidase (SBP)-catalyzed removal of phenol from wastewater has been demonstrated as a feasible wastewater treatment strategy and a non-ionic surfactant, Triton X-100, has the potential for increasing the enzyme economy of the process. Systematic studies on the enzyme-surfactant system have been lacking as well as demonstration of its applicability to industrial wastewater. This paper addresses those two gaps, the latter based on real wastewater from alkyd resin manufacture. The minimum effective Triton X-100 concentrations for crude SBP-catalyzed phenol conversion (≥95%) over 1-10 mM showed a linear trend. To illustrate translation of such lab results to real-world samples, this data were used to optimize crude <span class="gene">SBP</span> needed for phenol conversion over that concentration range. Triton X-100 increases enzyme economy by 10- to 13-fold. This treatment protocol was directly applied to tote-scale (700-1000 L) treatment of alkyd resin wastewater, with phenol ranging from 7 to 28 mM and total organic carbon <span class="trait">content</span> of &gt;40 g/L, using a crude <span class="gene">SBP</span> extract derived from dry soybean hulls by simple aqueous elution. This extract can be used to remove phenol from a complex industrial wastewater and the process is markedly more efficient in the presence of Triton X-100. The water is thus rendered amenable to conventional biological treatment whilst the hulls could still be used in feed, thus adding further value to the crop.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Photosynthesis in "green" seeds, such as rapeseed, soybean, and Arabidopsis, plays a substantial role in the improved efficiency of oil accumulation. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning the coordinated expression of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis- and photosynthesis-related genes in such developing seeds remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that seed-specific overexpression of BnWRI1, a <span class="gene">WRI1</span> homolog from rapeseed (Brassica napus cv. ZGY2), results in enhanced chlorophyll <span class="trait">content</span> in developing seeds and increased oil <span class="trait">content</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> mass in matured seeds. BnWRI1 was co-expressed with BnBCCP and BnCAB, two marker genes of FA biosynthesis and photosynthesis during <span class="trait">seed</span> development, respectively. Overexpression of BnWRI1 increased expression of both marker genes. Further, the nuclear-localized BnWRI1 <span class="trait">protein</span> was found to act as a transcription activator. It could bind to the GT1-element and/or GCC-box, which are widespread in the upstream regions of genes involved in FA biosynthesis and photosynthesis pathways. Accordingly, BnWRI1 could interact with promoters of BCCP2 and LHB1B2 in vivo. These results suggested that BnWRI1 may coordinate FA biosynthesis and photosynthesis pathways in developing seeds via directly stimulating expression of GT1-element and/or GCC-box containing genes.

						In the present study, four endophytic fungi <span class="gene">(GM-1,</span> <span class="gene">GM-2,</span> <span class="gene">GM-3,</span> and <span class="gene">GM-4)</span> were tested for their ability to improve soybean plant growth under salinity stress conditions.

The positive influence of fungi on plant growth was supported by gibberellins analysis of culture filtrate (CF), which showed wide diversity and various concentrations of GAs. Specifically, GA4, GA7, GA8, GA9, GA12, and GA20 were found in fungal CFs. Under salinity stress conditions, <span class="gene">GM-1</span> significantly enhanced the length and fresh weight of soybean plants relative to other fungal treatments. <span class="gene">GM-1</span> effectively mitigated the adverse effects of salinity by limiting lipid peroxidation and accumulating <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> <span class="gene">GM-2,</span> <span class="gene">GM-3,</span> and <span class="gene">GM-4</span> also counteracted the salinity induced oxidative stress in soybean plants through reduction of lipid peroxidation and enhancement of <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> maintaining the length and fresh weight of shoots. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were inhibited in salinity exposed plants, while <span class="gene">GM-1</span> significantly enhanced these antioxidant enzyme activities in plants under salt stress. <span class="gene">GM-1</span> treatment also showed lower levels of abscisic acid and elevated levels of salicylic acid in plants under salinity stress. Hence, <span class="gene">GM-1</span> was identified as Fusarium verticillioides (teleomorph Gibberella moniliformis) isolate RK01 based on its DNA sequence homology. These results suggest that endophytic fungal (F. verticillioides) pre-treatment of soybean seeds would be an effective method to promote soybean plant growth under salinity stress conditions.

						KEY MESSAGE: Two new sources of elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid were identified and the feasibility of an elevated stearic acid, high oleic acid germplasm was studied. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil typically contains 2-4% stearic acid. Oil with at least 20% stearic acid is desirable because of its improved baking properties and health profile. This study identifies two new sources of high stearic acid and evaluates the interaction of high stearic and oleic acid alleles. TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755, high stearic acid 'Holladay' mutants, were crossed to FAM94-41-3, a line containing a point mutation in a seed-specific isoform of a Δ9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (SACPD-C). F2-derived lines were evaluated for fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in four field environments. Sequencing of SACPDs in TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755 revealed distinct deletions of at least one megabase encompassing <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> in both lines. After genotyping, the additive effect for stearic acid was estimated at +1.8% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> point mutation and +4.1% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletions. Average stearic acid in lines homozygous for the deletions was 12.2%. A FAM94-41-3-derived line and TCHM08-1087-11, a selection from TCHM08-1087, were crossed to S09-2902-145, a line containing missense mutations in two fatty acid desaturases (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). F1 plants were grown in a greenhouse and individual F2 <span class="trait">seed</span> were genotyped and phenotyped. No interaction was observed between either <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> or <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> and any of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutant alleles. <span class="trait">Seed</span> homozygous mutant for SACPD-C/FAD2-1A/FAD2-1B contained 12.7% stearic acid and 65.5% oleic acid while <span class="trait">seed</span> homozygous for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion and mutant for <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> averaged 10.4% stearic acid and 75.9% oleic acid.

						KEY MESSAGE: fap 1 mutation is caused by a G174A change in <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> that disrupts a donor splice site recognition and creates a GATCTG motif that enhanced its expression. Soybean oil with reduced palmitic acid <span class="trait">content</span> is desirable to reduce the health risks associated with consumption of this fatty acid. The objectives of this study were: to identify the genomic location of the reduced palmitate fap1 mutation, determine its molecular basis, estimate the amount of phenotypic variation in fatty acid composition explained by this locus, determine if there are epistatic interactions between the fap1 and fap nc loci and, determine if the fap1 mutation has pleiotropic effects on <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> oil and <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in three soybean populations. This study detected two major QTL for 16:0 <span class="trait">content</span> located in chromosome 5 <span class="gene">(GmFATB1a,</span> fap nc) and chromosome 9 near BARCSOYSSR_09_1707 that explained, with their interaction, 66-94 % of the variation in 16:0 <span class="trait">content</span> in the three populations. Sequencing results of a putative candidate gene, <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA,</span> revealed a single unique polymorphism in the germplasm line C1726, which was predicted to disrupt the donor splice site recognition between exon one and intron one and produce a truncated KASIIIA <span class="trait">protein.</span> This G to A change also created the GATCTG motif that enhanced gene expression of the mutated <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> gene. Lines homozygous for the <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> mutation (fap1) had a significant reduction in 16:0, 18:0, and oil <span class="trait">content;</span> and an increase in unsaturated fatty acids <span class="trait">content.</span> There were significant epistatic interactions between <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> (fap1) and fap nc for 16:0 and oil contents, and <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> in two populations. In conclusion, the fap1 phenotype is caused by a single unique SNP in the <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> gene.

						In order to detect presence and quantity of Roundup Ready (RR) soybean in crude oil extracted from soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> with a different percentage of <span class="gene">GMO</span> <span class="trait">seed</span> two extraction methods were used, CTAB and DNeasy Plant Mini Kit. The amplifications of lectin gene, used to check the presence of soybean DNA, were not achieved in all CTAB extracts of DNA, while commercial kit gave satisfactory results. Comparing actual and estimated <span class="gene">GMO</span> <span class="trait">content</span> between two extraction methods, root mean square deviation for kit is 0.208 and for CTAB is 2.127, clearly demonstrated superiority of kit over CTAB extraction. The results of quantification evidently showed that if the oil samples originate from soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> with varying percentage of RR, it is possible to monitor the <span class="gene">GMO</span> <span class="trait">content</span> at the first stage of processing crude oil.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The reaction catalyzed by squalene synthase (EC.2.5.1.21) that converts two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene represents a crucial branch point of the isoprenoid pathway in diverting carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of sterols. In the present study two soybean squalene synthase genes, <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> and <span class="gene">GmSQS2,</span> were identified in the soybean genome and functionally characterized for their roles in sterol biosynthesis. Both genes encode a deduced <span class="trait">protein</span> of 413 amino acids. Complementation assays showed that the two genes were able to convert yeast sterol auxotrophy erg9 mutant to sterol prototrophy. Expression of <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> and <span class="gene">GmSQS2</span> was ubiquitous in roots, stem, leaves, flower and young seeds of soybean, however <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> transcript was preferential in roots while <span class="gene">GmSQS2</span> transcript was more in leaves. Their expression was lower in response to dehydration treatments suggesting they might be negative regulators of water stress adaptation. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> driven by either constitutive or seed-specific promoters showed increases in the major end product sterols: campesterol, sitosterol and stigmasterol, which resulted in up to 50% increase in total sterol <span class="trait">content</span> in the seeds. The increase in the end product sterols by <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> overexpression was at the level achievable by previously reported overexpression of individual or combination of other key enzymes in the sterol pathway. Together the data demonstrate that soybean SQS genes play an important role in diverting carbon flux to the biosynthesis of the end product sterols in the seeds.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is one of most important oil crops and a significant increase in lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds would facilitate vegetable oil production in the world. Although the pathways for lipid biosynthesis in higher plants have been uncovered, our understanding of regulatory mechanism controlling lipid accumulation is still limited. In this study, we identified 87 transcription factor genes with a higher abundance at the stage of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds. One of these genes, <span class="gene">GmbZIP123,</span> was selected to further study its function in regulation of lipid accumulation. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> enhanced lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgene promoted expression of two sucrose transporter genes (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertase genes (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6) by binding directly to the promoters of these genes. Consistently, the cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were all enhanced in siliques of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgenic plants. Higher levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose were also found in seeds of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgenic plants. These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> may participate in regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds by controlling sugar transport into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues. This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for lipid accumulation in seeds and may facilitate improvements in oil production in soybean and other oil crops through genetic manipulation of the <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> gene.

						The <span class="trait">protein</span> sequences of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> and <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> group S bZIP TFs were aligned using ClustalX software. The evolutionary analyses were conducted with 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA5, using the neighbour-joining method ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0038"> Tamura <italic> et al </italic> ., 2011 </xref> ).

The GFP221 vector containing the 35S:GFP construct was used as control. These plasmids were introduced into <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> protoplasts by polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection. Transfected cells were cultivated for 20h and then observed under a Leica TCS SP5 microscope.

GFP fluorescence was observed under a confocal microscope. <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> was targeted exclusively to the nuclei of protoplast cells, while the control GFP <span class="trait">protein</span> was observed throughout the entire cell, demonstrating that <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> is a nuclear <span class="trait">protein</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> Fig. 2A </xref> ).

We further examined whether <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> possessed transcription activation activity in transiently transformed <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> protoplasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> Fig. 2C </xref> , <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> showed transcription activation activity to promote expression of a <italic> LUC </italic> reporter gene in protoplasts when compared with the negative control. However, this result seemed to be inconsistent with that obtained in the yeast assay ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> Fig. 2B </xref> ), where a single BD&#x02013;GmbZIP123 fusion <span class="trait">protein</span> could not activate transcription of the <italic> <span class="gene">HIS3</span> </italic> reporter gene ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> Fig. 2B </xref> ). As many endogenous proteins are expressed in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> protoplasts, the discrepancy of transcription activation activity in the yeast system and protoplast system was probably derived from the expression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123-interacting</span> proteins in protoplasts. In view of the interaction between <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> and <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> group C bZIP TFs, we proposed that <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> may perform transcription activation mainly through heterodimerization with group C bZIP TFs. Therefore, we co-expressed <span class="gene">GmbZIP123&#x02013;BD</span> fusion <span class="trait">protein</span> and AtbZIP10/AtbZIP25 in yeast, and the yeast strains could grow on SD/&#x02013;His/&#x02013;Trp medium, indicating that <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> induces transcription of target genes through heterodimerization with group C bZIP TFs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> Fig. 2D </xref> ).

						Lipid accumulation in plant seeds is a complex and well-organized biological process, accompanied by <span class="trait">protein</span> synthesis and starch consumption. A large amount of imported organic materials and energy are the indispensable foundation for rapid synthesis of lipid. Efforts to increase the lipid <span class="trait">content</span> of seeds should focus on how to enhance material import and accelerate the speed of lipid synthesis. In this study, we showed that overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> </italic> in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> could enhance lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds of transgenic plants. Coincident with this observation, genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport were upregulated by <italic> <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> </italic> , and the cwINV activity and sugar transport were also enhanced in siliques of <italic> <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> </italic> transgenic plants. The levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose were further increased significantly in seeds of transgenic plants. These results demonstrated that <italic> <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> </italic> participates in the regulation of lipid accumulation in seeds, probably through the promotion of sugar translocation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We analyzed the molecular mechanism controlling ω-3 fatty acid desaturases during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and leaf development in soybean. During germination, soybean seeds were characterized by a high 18:2(Δ9,12) level (more than 50%) and reduced 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> (10%). Interestingly, transcripts from all endoplasmic reticulum <span class="gene">(GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B)</span> and plastidial <span class="gene">(GmFAD7-1/GmFAD7-2</span> or <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1/GmFAD8-2)</span> desaturase genes were detected during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination. Upon germination, soybean trifoliate leaf development was accompanied by an increase in linolenic acid (18:3(Δ9,12,15)). Our data showed that transcripts corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B</span> decreased with leaf development. No changes in the expression profile of the plastidial ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD7-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD7-2</span> genes were detected. On the contrary, <span class="gene">GmFAD8-2</span> transcript levels increased while <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> transcripts decreased during leaf development. Given this expression profile, our data suggested the existence of a temporal regulatory mechanism controlling ω-3 desaturases during leaf development in which the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases would be more important in young leaves while plastidial ω-3 desaturases might contribute to 18:3(Δ9,12,15) production in mature leaves. Photosynthetic cell cultures showed 18:3(Δ9,12,15) levels similar to those from leaves. No changes in the 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> or expression of the ω-3 desaturase genes were detected along the cell culture cycle. A comparison of our data with those available in Arabidopsis or wheat suggested that the regulatory mechanism controlling the expression and activity of both endoplasmic reticulum and plastidial desaturases during leaf development might differ among plant species.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low phosphorus (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved P efficiency in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and P <span class="trait">content,</span> respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P efficiency could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds accumulate large amounts of isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein), secondary metabolites known for their phytoestrogenic activities. Isoflavone composition depends on the <span class="trait">seed</span> part and glycitein is almost found exclusively in hypocotyls. Moreover, two major phenotypes are encountered in soybean cultivars, with either low (35 %) or high (55 %) levels of glycitein in their hypocotyls. This trait was under a quasi-mendelian heredity, implicating at most one or two genes. A <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> cDNA displaying a flavonoid 6-hydroxylase (F6H) activity had previously been isolated from elicitor-induced soybean (Glycine max L.) cells. This enzyme allows the synthesis of the glycitein flavanone intermediate (6,7,4'- trihydroxyflavanone) by catalyzing the A-ring hydroxylation of liquiritigenin. In this study, the <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> gene (F6H1) and two other candidates (F6H2 and F6H3) were studied using contrasted soybean cultivars for glycitein <span class="trait">content</span> (0, 35, 55 and 80 %). Their expression was observed in chitosan elicited leaves. They encode <span class="gene">P450</span> proteins of 496, 469 and 481 amino acids respectively and were expressed in leaves with or without elicitation. The expression patterns of these three genes were performed in cotyledons and hypocotyls at different developmental stages. <span class="gene">F6H1</span> and <span class="gene">F6H2</span> were not expressed in the developing <span class="trait">seed.</span> <span class="gene">F6H3</span> was only expressed in hypocotyls. Its expression levels did not correlate with hypocotyls glycitein <span class="trait">content,</span> but it was not expressed in the null mutant for glycitein. Thus, this <span class="gene">F6H3</span> gene is a good potential candidate for glycitein biosynthesis in soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span>

						Tocochromanol, or vitamin E, plays a crucial role in human and animal nutrition and is synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. γ-Tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT), one of the key enzymes in the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway in plants, converts γ, δ-tocopherols into α-, β-tocopherols.

						Soybeans are an important source of protein-rich meal for livestock feed formulations. Recent changes in the cost of commodity-based sources of metabolizable energy (ME) inputs has put pressure on soybean meal to deliver both <span class="trait">protein</span> and ME in feed formulations. The non-oil fraction of soybean contains approximately 12% soluble carbohydrates, principally sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose. Of these carbohydrates, only sucrose is positive for ME. Both raffinose and stachyose, belonging to the raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs), are considered antinutritional because of the negative consequences of their fermentation in the gut of monogastric animals when RFOs are consumed in the diet. Therefore, there is an interest in improving soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> composition so that it contains higher ME and fewer antinutritional components by increasing the sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> while lowering the RFOs. Several soybean lines have been discovered that contain altered levels of RFOs, and recent molecular genetic investigations have shown the phenotype to be caused by mutations in a raffinose synthase 2 (RS2) gene encoding the enzyme that is the committed step for RFO biosynthesis. The objective of this research was to determine the variation in carbohydrate profile for different soybean lines grown in a single location containing one of three different alleles of the <span class="gene">RS2</span> gene. The results indicate that, although there is variation in the carbohydrate profiles for each line, different lines with the same <span class="gene">RS2</span> genotype tend to produce a characteristic carbohydrate profile. Although the carbohydrate profile for each <span class="gene">RS2</span> genotype class was consistent in different genetic backgrounds under two conditions grown at one location, more research will be necessary to determine the environmental stability of the carbohydrate profiles in multiple locations over different years.

Therefore, for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with SPC, 212 F(2:9) lines of the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of ZDD09454 × Yudou12 were grown along with the parents, in six different environments (location × year) to determine inheritance and map solubility-related genes. A linkage map comprising of 301 SSR markers covering 3,576.81 cM was constructed in the RIL population. <span class="trait">Seed</span> SPC was quantified with a macro-Kjeldahl procedure in samples collected over multiple years from three locations (Nantong in 2007 and 2008, Zhengzhou in 2007 and 2008, and Xinxiang in 2008 and 2009). SPC demonstrated transgressive segregation, indicating a complementary genetic structure between the parents. Eleven putative QTL were associated with SPC explaining 4.5-18.2 % of the observed phenotypic variation across the 6 year/location environments. Among these, two QTL (qsp8-4, qsp8-5) near <span class="gene">GMENOD2B</span> and Sat_215 showed an association with SPC in multiple environments, suggesting that they were key QTL related to <span class="trait">protein</span> solubility. The QTL × environment interaction demonstrated the complex genetic mechanism of SPC. These SPC-associated QTL and linked markers in soybean will provide important information that can be utilized by breeders to improve the functional quality of soybean varieties.

						Soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr]) plants export nitrogen from the nodules as ureides during symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation. Ureides also play a role as nitrogen storage compounds in the seeds and are broken down in germinating seedlings. In this work we identified four soybean genes encoding allantoinase (E.C. 3.5.2.5), an enzyme involved in both ureide production in nodules and ureide catabolism in leaves and other sink tissues. We examined ureide <span class="trait">content,</span> allantoinase enzyme activity and expression of these genes, which we term <span class="gene">GmALN1</span> through <span class="gene">GmALN4,</span> in germinating seedlings and in vegetative tissues from 45 day old soybean plants. <span class="gene">GmALN1</span> and <span class="gene">GmALN2</span> transcripts were measured in all tissues, but similar levels of expression of <span class="gene">GmALN3</span> and <span class="gene">GmALN4</span> was only observed in nodules. The soybean allantoinase genes seem to have arisen through tandem gene duplication followed by a whole genome duplication. We looked for evidence of the tandem duplication in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and present evidence that it occured sometime in the bean lineage before these two species diverged, but before soybean became a tetraploid.

						α-Linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of ω6:ω3 fatty acid ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> and to reduce the ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to ALA. Six ω-3 (Δ-15) fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g⁻¹ to 8.57 mg g⁻¹ and 10.06 mg g⁻¹, respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA <span class="trait">content</span> was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2/3</span> and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet &gt;80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.

						Urea is the nitrogen fertilizer most utilized in crop production worldwide. Understanding all factors involved in urea metabolism in plants is an essential step towards assessing and possibly improving the use of urea by plants. Urease, the enzyme responsible for urea hydrolysis, and its accessory proteins, necessary for nickel incorporation into the enzyme active site and concomitant activation, have been extensively characterized in bacteria. In contrast, little is known about their plant counterparts. This work reports a detailed characterization of Glycine max UreG <span class="gene">(GmUreG),</span> a urease accessory <span class="trait">protein.</span> Two forms of native <span class="gene">GmUreG,</span> purified from seeds, were separated by metal affinity chromatography, and their properties (GTPase activity in absence and presence of Ni(2+) or Zn(2+), secondary structure and metal <span class="trait">content)</span> were compared with the recombinant <span class="trait">protein</span> produced in Escherichia coli. The binding affinity of recombinant <span class="gene">GmUreG</span> (rGmUreG) for Ni(2+) and Zn(2+) was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. rGmUreG binds Zn(2+) or Ni(2+) differently, presenting a very tight binding site for Zn(2+) (K (d) = 0.02 ± 0.01 μM) but not for Ni(2+), thus suggesting that Zn(2+) may play a role on the plant urease assembly process, as suggested for bacteria. Size exclusion chromatography showed that Zn(2+) stabilizes a dimeric form of the rGmUreG, while NMR measurements indicate that rGmUreG belongs to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. A homology model for the fully folded <span class="gene">GmUreG</span> was built and compared to bacterial UreG models, and the possible sites of interaction with other accessory proteins were investigated.

						Plant oils can be useful chemical feedstocks such as a source of epoxy fatty acids. High seed-specific expression of a Stokesia laevis epoxygenase (SlEPX) in soybeans only results in 3-7% epoxide levels. SlEPX-transgenic soybean seeds also exhibited other phenotypic alterations, such as altered <span class="trait">seed</span> fatty acid profiles, reduced oil accumulation, and variable <span class="trait">protein</span> levels. SlEPX-transgenic seeds showed a 2-5% reduction in total oil <span class="trait">content</span> and <span class="trait">protein</span> levels of 30.9-51.4%. To address these pleiotrophic effects of SlEPX expression on other traits, transgenic soybeans were developed to co-express SlEPX and <span class="gene">DGAT</span> (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) genes (VgDGAT1 & 2) isolated from Vernonia galamensis, a high accumulator of epoxy fatty acids. These side effects of SlEPX expression were largely overcome in the <span class="gene">DGAT</span> co-expressing soybeans. Total oil and <span class="trait">protein</span> contents were restored to the levels in non-transgenic soybeans, indicating that both VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2 could complement the disrupted phenotypes caused by over-expression of an epoxygenase in soybean seeds.

Total isoflavones were between 2.78 and 8.66 μmol/g flour. RDSC of all lines was between 0.48 and 14.62 μmol Trolox equiv (TE)/g flour, and HOSC ranged from 53.57 to 135.52 μmol TE/g flour. Some modified-LOX genotypes demonstrated antioxidant capacity and/or isoflavone <span class="trait">content</span> similar to or higher than those of the nonmodified cultivar (P &lt; 0.05). Black soybeans demonstrated higher TPC and RDSC than most yellow soybean lines, although they did not have higher isoflavone <span class="trait">content.</span> The results demonstrate that modification of the <span class="gene">LOX</span> trait did not necessarily alter the antioxidant capacity or chemical composition of the experimental soybean lines when compared with a nonmodified cultivar. These soybean lines may be studied further for nutraceutical properties and use in functional foods.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is a salt-sensitive crop, and its production is severely affected by saline soils. Therefore, the response of soybean seeds to salt stress during germination was investigated at both physiological and proteomic levels. The salt-tolerant cultivar Lee68 and salt-sensitive cultivar N2899 were exposed to 100 mmol/L NaCl until radicle protrusion from the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat. In both cultivars, the final germination percentage was not affected by salt, but the mean germination times of Lee68 and N2899 were delayed by 0.3 and 1.0 d, respectively, compared with controls. In response to salt stress, the abscisic acid <span class="trait">content</span> increased, and gibberellic acid (GA₁+₃) and isopentenyladenosine decreased. Indole-3-acetic acid increased in Lee68, but remained unchanged in N2899. The proteins extracted from germinated seeds were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), followed by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 staining. About 350 <span class="trait">protein</span> spots from 2-DE gels of pH range 3 to 10 and 650 spots from gels of pH range 4 to 7 were reproducibly resolved, of which 18 <span class="trait">protein</span> spots showed changes in abundance as a result of salt stress in both cultivars. After matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis of the differentially expressed proteins, the peptide mass fingerprint was searched against the soybean UniGene database and nine proteins were successfully identified. Ferritin and 20S proteasome subunit β-6 were up-regulated in both cultivars. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) 9, <span class="gene">GST</span> 10, and <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation <span class="trait">protein</span> PM36 were down-regulated in Lee68 by salt, but still remained at a certain level. However, these proteins were present in lower levels in control N2899 and were up-regulated under salt stress. The results indicate that these proteins might have important roles in defense mechanisms against salt stress during soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> germination.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The alteration of fatty acid profiles in soybean to improve soybean oil quality has been a long-time goal of soybean researchers. Soybean oil with elevated oleic acid is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of soybean oil compared to other oils. In the lipid biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) is responsible for the conversion of oleic acid precursors to linoleic acid precursors in developing soybean seeds. Two genes encoding <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were identified to be expressed specifically in seeds during embryogenesis and have been considered to hold an important role in controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> A total of 22 soybean plant introduction (PI) lines identified to have an elevated oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> were characterized for sequence mutations in the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. PI 603452 was found to contain a deletion of a nucleotide in the second exon of FAD2-1A. These important SNPs were used in developing molecular marker genotyping assays. The assays appear to be a reliable and accurate tool to identify the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genotype of wild-type and mutant plants. PI 603452 was subsequently crossed with PI 283327, a soybean line that has a mutation in FAD2-1B. Interestingly, soybean lines carrying both homozygous insertion/deletion mutation (indel) <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> alleles and mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles have an average of 82-86% oleic acid <span class="trait">content,</span> compared to 20% in conventional soybean, and low levels of linoleic and linolenic acids. The newly identified indel mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene offers a simple method for the development of high oleic acid commercial soybean varieties.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds contain substantial amount of diverse triterpenoid saponins that influence the <span class="trait">seed</span> quality, although little is known about the physiologic functions of saponins in plants. We now describe the modification of saponin biosynthesis by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing targeted to β-amyrin synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of a common aglycon of soybean saponins. We identified two putative β-amyrin synthase genes in soybean that manifested distinct expression patterns with regard to developmental stage and tissue specificity. Given that one of these genes, <span class="gene">GmBAS1,</span> was expressed at a much higher level than the other <span class="gene">(GmBAS2)</span> in various tissues including the developing seeds, we constructed two RNAi vectors that encode self-complementary hairpin RNAs corresponding to the distinct regions of <span class="gene">GmBAS1</span> under the control of a seed-specific promoter derived from the soybean gene for the α' subunit of the <span class="trait">seed</span> storage <span class="trait">protein</span> β-conglycinin. These vectors were introduced independently into soybean. Six independent transgenic lines exhibited a stable reduction in <span class="trait">seed</span> saponin <span class="trait">content,</span> with the extent of saponin deficiency correlating with the β-amyrin synthase mRNA depletion. Although some transgenic lines produced seeds almost devoid of saponins, no abnormality in their growth was apparent and the antioxidant activity of their seeds was similar to that of control seeds. These results suggest that saponins are not required for <span class="trait">seed</span> development and survival, and that soybean seeds may therefore be amenable to the modification of triterpenoid saponin <span class="trait">content</span> and composition through molecular biologic approaches.

						Mutagenized populations have become indispensable resources for introducing variation and studying gene function in plant genomics research. In this study, fast neutron (FN) radiation was used to induce deletion mutations in the soybean (Glycine max) genome. Approximately 120,000 soybean seeds were exposed to FN radiation doses of up to 32 Gray units to develop over 23,000 independent M2 lines. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this population for phenotypic screening and associated genomic characterization of striking and agronomically important traits. Plant variation was cataloged for <span class="trait">seed</span> composition, maturity, morphology, pigmentation, and nodulation traits. Mutants that showed significant increases or decreases in <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil <span class="trait">content</span> across multiple generations and environments were identified. The application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to lesion-induced mutants for deletion mapping was validated on a midoleate x-ray mutant, M23, with a known <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> (for fatty acid desaturase) gene deletion. Using CGH, a subset of mutants was characterized, revealing deletion regions and candidate genes associated with phenotypes of interest. Exome resequencing and sequencing of PCR products confirmed FN-induced deletions detected by CGH. Beyond characterization of soybean FN mutants, this study demonstrates the utility of CGH, exome sequence capture, and next-generation sequencing approaches for analyses of mutant plant genomes. We present this FN mutant soybean population as a valuable public resource for future genetic screens and functional genomics research.

						Numerous environmental factors influence isoflavone accumulation and have long hampered their genetic dissection. Temperature and water regimes are two of the most significant abiotic factors. However, while the effects of temperature have been widely studied, little is known about how water scarcity might affect isoflavone concentration in seeds. Studies have shown that accumulation of isoflavones is promoted by well-watered conditions, but the molecular basis remains elusive. The length and severity of the water stress required to induce changes are also still unknown. In the present work, several intensities of water stress were evaluated at various critical stages for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">seed</span> development, in both field and controlled environments. The results suggested that only long-term progressive <span class="trait">drought,</span> spanning most of the <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages, significantly decreased isoflavone <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds. The reduction is proportional to the intensity of the stress and appears to occur in a genotype-dependent manner. However, regardless of water regime, isoflavone compounds were mainly accumulated in the later <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages. Transcripts of the most important genes for isoflavone biosynthesis were also quantified from samples collected at key <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages under well-watered and long-term water deficit conditions. Expression of CHS7, CHS8 and <span class="gene">IFS2</span> correlated with isoflavone accumulation under well-watered conditions. Interestingly, we found that the two isoflavone synthase genes in soybean (IFS1 and IFS2) showed different patterns of expression. The abundance of <span class="gene">IFS1</span> transcripts was maintained at a constant rate, whereas <span class="gene">IFS2</span> was down-regulated and highly correlated with isoflavone accumulation under both water deficit and well-watered conditions, suggesting <span class="gene">IFS2</span> as a main contributor to isoflavone diminution under <span class="trait">drought.</span>

						Sterol 24C-methyltransferases (SMTs) constitute a group of sequence-related proteins that catalyze the distinct patterns of 24-alkyl sterols that occur throughout nature. Two SMT cDNAs (SMT2-1 and SMT2-2) were cloned by homology based PCR methods from young leaves of Glycine max (soybean) and the corresponding enzymes were expressed functionally in Escherichia coli. The full-length cDNA for <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> have open reading frames of 1086 bp and 1092 bp, respectively, and encode proteins of 361 and 363 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 40.3 and 40.4 kDa, respectively. The substrate preference of the two isoforms was similar yet they differed from SMT1; kinetically <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> generated k(cat) values for the optimal substrate 24(28)methylene lophenol of 0.8 min(-1) and 1.34 min(-1), respectively, compared to the activity of SMT1 that generated a k(cat) for the optimal substrate cycloartenol of 0.6 min(-1). <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> was purified to homogeneity and the subunit organization shown to be tetrameric in similar fashion to other cloned SMTs. Analysis of the accumulated products catalyzed by the recombinant enzymes demonstrated that soybean <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> operate transalkylation activities analogous to the soybean plant SMT1. Metabolite analyses correlated with transcript profiling of the three SMT isoforms during soybean maturation clearly demonstrated that SMT isoform expression determines specific C24-methyl to C24-ethyl ratios to flowering whereas with <span class="trait">seed</span> development there is a disconnection such that the SMT transcript levels decrease against an increase in sterol <span class="trait">content;</span> generally <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> is expressed more than <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> or SMT1. These observations suggest that the genes that encode SMT1 and SMT2 in sitosterol biosynthesis may have undergone divergent evolution. In support of this proposition, the genomic organization for SMT1 of fungi and protozoa align very closely with one another and to those of the plant SMT2; both sets of SMTs lack introns. Unexpectedly, the SMT1 from Glycine max and other embryophytes of diverse origin possess disparate intron-exon characteristics that can be shown relates back to the algae. Our results suggest that the order of SMT1 appearing before SMT2 in phytosterol synthesis arose recently in plant evolution in response to duplication of a more primitive SMT gene likely to have been bifunctional and catalytically promiscuous.

						Reduction of phytic acid in soybean seeds has the potential to improve the nutritional value of soybean meal and lessen phosphorus pollution in large scale animal farming. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of two new low phytic acid (LPA) mutations on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits. Multilocation/season comparative analyses showed that the two mutations did not affect the concentration of crude <span class="trait">protein,</span> any of the individual amino acids, crude oil, and individual saturated fatty acids. Among other traits, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW75-1</span> had consistently higher sucrose contents (+47.4-86.1%) and lower raffinose contents (-74.2 to -84.3%) than those of wild type (WT) parent Taiwan 75; <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had higher total isoflavone contents (3038.8-4305.4 microg/g) than its parent Zhechun # 3 (1583.6-2644.9 microg/g) in all environments. Further tests of homozygous F(3) progenies of the cross <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> x Wuxing # 4 (WT variety) showed that LPA lines had a mean <span class="trait">content</span> of total isoflavone significantly higher than WT lines. This study demonstrated that two LPA mutant genes have no negative effects on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits; they instead have the potential to improve a few other properties. Therefore, these two mutant genes are valuable genetic resources for breeding high quality soybean varieties.

						A nontargeted <span class="trait">protein</span> identification method was developed to screen for adulterations in skimmed-milk powder (SMP). There are indications of falsified SMP <span class="trait">content</span> due to the addition of plant proteins. To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the developed comparative LC-MS method using a quadrupole TOF <span class="gene">MS</span> instrument, adulterated SMP samples were prepared by the addition of <span class="trait">protein</span> isolates of soy and pea to skimmed-milk before pasteurisation and evaporation. The comparative LC-MS approach enabled unequivocal discrimination of those SMP samples containing soy and pea <span class="trait">protein</span> from nonadulterated SMP. To identify the source of (plant) proteins present in the adulterated SMP, data-dependent LC-MS/MS was used in combination with an include list of differential peptides. Numerous peptides originating from the major <span class="trait">seed</span> proteins of soy (glycinin, beta-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified in this way.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Changes in flavonoid <span class="trait">content</span> are often manifested as altered pigmentation in plant tissues. Two loci have been identified as controlling pigmentation in soybean pubescence. Of these, the T locus appears to encode flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) <span class="trait">protein:</span> the T and t alleles are associated with tawny and gray colors, respectively, in pubescence. We previously down-regulated <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene expression by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in soybean. Despite this successful VIGS, the tawny pubescence pigmentation proved to be unchanged in greenhouse-grown plants. We hypothesized that the reduced mRNA level of the <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene resulting from VIGS remained high enough to induce pigmentation. To verify this hypothesis, in the present study, we performed <span class="gene">F3'H</span> VIGS on plants grown under controlled conditions, in which the steady-state mRNA level of the <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene was reduced to approximately 5% of that of greenhouse-grown plants. This VIGS treatment resulted in the loss of tawny pigmentation in pubescence, suggesting that the <span class="gene">sf3'h1</span> gene is involved in the control of pigmentation in pubescence. We detected a marked decrease in target mRNA, an accumulation of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and a decrease in quercetin <span class="trait">content</span> relative to kaempferol in leaf tissues, indicating that sequence-specific mRNA degradation of the <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene was induced. These results suggest that leaf tissues have a threshold mRNA level of the <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene, which is associated with the occurrence of tawny pigmentation in pubescence. The estimated threshold mRNA level for pigmentation in pubescence was approximately 3% of the steady-state mRNA level of the <span class="gene">F3'H</span> gene in greenhouse-grown plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is one of the most important leguminous <span class="trait">seed</span> crops among the oil crops. Although the pathways for lipid biosynthesis have been identified, the factors that regulate the biosynthetic pathways at the transcriptional level are largely unknown. Here, we report our findings on the involvement of soybean Dof-type transcription factor genes in the regulation of the lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds. We identified 28 Dof-type transcription factor genes in soybean plants, and these genes displayed diverse patterns of expression in various organs. Seven flower/pod-specific genes and one constitutively expressed gene were further investigated. The proteins encoded by these seven genes were localized in the nucleus, and exhibited different abilities for transcriptional activation and DNA binding. Two genes, <span class="gene">GmDof4</span> and <span class="gene">GmDof11,</span> were found to increase the <span class="trait">content</span> of total fatty acids and lipids in <span class="gene">GmDof4</span> and <span class="gene">GmDof11</span> transgenic Arabidopsis seeds. We also found that the 1000-seed weight was increased in the <span class="gene">GmDof4</span> and <span class="gene">GmDof11</span> transgenic plants. Using microarray and DNA binding analysis, we found that the two Dof-like proteins, <span class="gene">GmDof4</span> and <span class="gene">GmDof11,</span> activated the acetyl CoA carboxylase gene and long-chain-acyl CoA synthetase gene, respectively, by direct binding to the cis-DNA elements in their promoter regions. In addition, both proteins downregulated the storage <span class="trait">protein</span> gene, CRA1, through direct binding. These results suggest that the two <span class="gene">GmDof</span> genes may augment the lipid <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean seeds by upregulating genes that are associated with the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

						The sucrose binding <span class="trait">protein</span> (SBP) belongs to the cupin family of proteins and is structurally related to vicilin-like storage proteins. In this investigation, a <span class="gene">SBP</span> isoform <span class="gene">(GmSBP2/S64)</span> was expressed in E. coli and large amounts of the <span class="trait">protein</span> accumulated in the insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies. The renatured <span class="trait">protein</span> was studied by circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence, and binding of the hydrophobic probes <span class="gene">ANS</span> and Bis-ANS. The estimated <span class="trait">content</span> of secondary structure of the renatured <span class="trait">protein</span> was consistent with that obtained by theoretical modeling with a large predominance of beta-strand structure (42%) over the alpha-helix (9.9%). The fluorescence emission maximum of 303 nm for <span class="gene">SBP2</span> indicated that the fluorescent tryptophan was completely buried within a highly hydrophobic environment. We also measured the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of sucrose binding by fluorescence titration using the refolded <span class="trait">protein.</span> The low sucrose binding affinity (K(d)=2.79+/-0.22 mM) of the renatured <span class="trait">protein</span> was similar to that of the native <span class="trait">protein</span> purified from soybean seeds. Collectively, these results indicate that the folded structure of the renatured <span class="trait">protein</span> was similar to the native <span class="gene">SBP</span> <span class="trait">protein.</span> As a member of the bicupin family of proteins, which includes highly stable <span class="trait">seed</span> storage proteins, <span class="gene">SBP2</span> was fairly stable at high temperatures. Likewise, it remained folded to a similar extent in the presence or absence of 7.6M urea or 6.7 M GdmHCl. The high stability of the renatured <span class="trait">protein</span> may be a reminiscent property of <span class="gene">SBP</span> from its evolutionary relatedness to the <span class="trait">seed</span> storage proteins.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effects of increasing levels of solvent-extracted palm kernel meal (SPKM) and corn distillers dried grains (CDG) in corn silage-based diets on feed intake and milk production were examined in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, 20 Holstein cows averaging 100 d in milk (DIM) (SD = 61.5) at the start of the experiment were utilized in an 11-wk randomized complete block design with 4 treatments in 5 blocks to study effects of increasing levels of SPKM in the diet. During a 3-wk preliminary period, cows were fed a standard diet. At the end of the preliminary period, cows were blocked by 4% fat-corrected milk <span class="trait">yield,</span> parity number (primiparous and multiparous), and DIM, and were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 experimental diets. The total mixed ration (TMR) consisted of (dry matter basis) 40% corn silage, 5% coarsely chopped wheat straw, and 55% concentrate. The increasing dietary levels of SPKM were achieved by replacing <span class="trait">protein</span> sources and citrus pulp with SPKM and urea (0, 5, 10, and 15% SPKM and 0.06, 0.22, 0.38, and 0.55% urea for SPKM0, SPKM5, SPKM10, and SPKM15, respectively). In Experiment 2, 18 Holstein cows averaging 93 <span class="gene">DIM</span> (SD = 49.1) at the start of the experiment were utilized in an 11-wk randomized complete block design with 3 treatments in 6 blocks to study effects of increasing levels of CDG in the diet. The preliminary period lasted for 2 wk. Assignment of cows to treatments was the same as in Experiment 1. The TMR consisted of (dry matter basis) 40% corn silage, 5% coarsely chopped wheat straw, and 55% concentrate. The increasing dietary levels of CDG were achieved by replacing soybean meal and citrus pulp with CDG and urea (0, 7, and 14% CDG and 0, 0.22, and 0.49% urea for CDG0, CDG7, and CDG14, respectively). There were no significant treatment effects on dry matter intake, milk <span class="trait">yield,</span> or milk composition in Experiment 1. Inclusion of SPKM tended to increase <span class="trait">protein</span> and lactose contents of milk. The SPKM0 diet promoted body weight loss. There were no treatment effects in Experiment 2, except for milk <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> which was decreased by CDG. Plasma Lys concentration tended to be affected by SPKM and CDG inclusions. Plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine and Leu seemed to be related to body <span class="trait">protein</span> degradation/synthesis. The feeding of SPKM up to 15% in the diet decreased feed costs without detrimental effects on productive responses and tended to increase milk <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> The inclusion of CDG in diets based on corn silage and corn byproducts might decrease milk <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> due to an unbalanced supply of AA, particularly Lys.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Alpha-linolenic acid(ALA, C18:3delta9,12,15 ) is an essential fatty acid which has many sanitary functions to human. However, its contents in diets are often not enough. In plants, omega-3 fatty acid desaturases(FAD) catalyze linoleic acid(LA, C18:2delta9,12) into ALA. The <span class="trait">seed</span> oil of Glycine max contains high level of ALA. To investigate the functions of Glycine max omega-3FAD, the cDNA of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C was amplified by RT-PCR from immature seeds, then cloned into the shuttle expression vector p416 to generate the recombinant vector p4GFAD3C. The resulting vector was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae K601 throuth LiAc method. The positive clones were screened on the CM(Ura-) medium and identified by PCR, and then cultured in CM (Ura-) liquid medium with exogenous LA in 20 degrees C for three days. The intracellular fatty acid composition of the engineering strain Kp416 and Kp4GFAD3C was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A novel peak in strain Kp4GFAD3C was detected,which was not detectable in control, Comparison of the retention times of the newly yielded peak with that of authentic standard indicated that the fatty acid is ALA. The <span class="trait">content</span> of ALA reached to 3.1% of the total fatty acid in recombinant strain, the <span class="trait">content</span> of LA correspondingly decreased from 22% to 16.2% by contrast. It was suggested that the <span class="trait">protein</span> encoded by <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C can specifically catalyze 18 carbon PUFA substrate of LA into ALA by taking off hydrogen atoms at delta15 location. In this study, we expressed a Glycine max omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene in S. cerevisiae; An efficient and economical yeast expressing system(K601-p416 system) which is suitable for the expression of FAD was built.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate <span class="gene">(GmMIPS1)</span> gene. We have observed an absence of <span class="trait">seed</span> development in lines in which the presence of <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic reduction of phytate (InsP6) <span class="trait">content</span> was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> gene expression and <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Several methods for extraction and quantification of proteins from lecithins were compared. Extraction with hexane-2-propanol-water followed by amino acid analysis is the most suitable method for isolation and quantification of proteins from lecithins. The detection limit of the method is 15 mg protein/kg lecithin, and the quantification limit is 50 mg protein/kg. The relative repeatability limits for samples containing 0-500 and 500-5000 mg protein/kg sample were 12.6 and 7.5%, respectively. The <span class="trait">protein</span> recovery ranged between 101 and 123%. The <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> has been determined in different kinds of lecithins. The results were as follows: standard soy lecithins (between 232 and 1338 mg/kg), deoiled soy lecithin (342 mg/kg), phosphatydylcholine-enriched soy lecithins (not detectable and 163 mg/kg), sunflower lecithins (892 and 414 mg/kg), and egg lecithin (50 mg/kg). The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis <span class="trait">protein</span> patterns of the standard soy and sunflower lecithins are very similar to those of soy flour. The <span class="trait">protein</span> profile of the egg lecithin shows several bands with a broad range of molecular masses. The molecular masses of the main proteins of soy lecithins and soy flour have been determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and ranged from 10.5 to 52.2 kDa. Most of the major proteins from soy and sunflower lecithins identified by MALDI-MS and electrospray tandem <span class="gene">MS</span> belong to the 11S globulin fraction, which is one of the main fractions of soy and sunflower seeds. In addition, the <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation <span class="trait">protein</span> P34 from the 7S globulin fraction of soy proteins has also been identified in soy lecithins. This <span class="trait">protein</span> has been reported as the most allergenic <span class="trait">protein</span> in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A transgenic approach was used to alter soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> phytate <span class="trait">content</span> by expressing a soybean phytase gene <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> during <span class="trait">seed</span> development to degrade accumulating phytic acid (IP6). An expression vector containing the soybean phytase cDNA controlled by the seed-specific beta-conglycinin promoter (alpha'-subunit) was used to transform embryogenic soybean cultures. Plants from four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for transgene integration and <span class="trait">seed</span> IP6 levels. The reduction in IP6 levels in transgenic seeds compared to control 'Jack' soybeans ranged from 12.6 to 24.8 as determined by HPLC. A low copy transformant was propagated to the T4 generation and examined in more detail for phytase expression and enzyme activity during <span class="trait">seed</span> development. Expression of phytase mRNA and phytase activity increased during <span class="trait">seed</span> development, consistent with the use of an embryo-specific promoter. Ectopic phytase expression during <span class="trait">seed</span> development offers potential as an effective strategy for reducing phytate <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span>

						Four storage conditions including adverse conditions [84% relative humidity (RH), 30 degrees C], mild conditions (57% RH, 20 degrees C), cold conditions (4 degrees C), and uncontrolled ambient conditions were used for storing soybeans. The storage time was 9 months for the adverse conditions and 18 months for the other three conditions. Beta-conglycinin was purified and characterized with respect to its molecular properties. After storage under the adverse conditions, beta-conglycinin showed no significant changes in total sugar <span class="trait">content,</span> surface hydrophobicity, free SH and <span class="gene">SS</span> bonds, and amino acid composition within 6 months; however, it showed a significant decrease in surface hydrophobicity and a significant increase in total free SH and total SH including <span class="gene">SS</span> <span class="trait">content</span> after 6 months. Analysis of the secondary structure showed a significant increase in alpha-helix <span class="trait">content,</span> but a significant decrease in beta-sheet <span class="trait">content</span> after 3 months. For the other three conditions, no significant changes occurred to the structures of beta-conglycinin when compared to the control. The molecular mass of beta-conglycinin remained in the range of 199-212 kDa for all conditions during the entire storage periods.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the presented study the influence of dehulling rapeseed on the composition of rapeseed meal (RM) and rapeseed cake (RC) and on its feed value for piglets and growing-finishing pigs was investigated. Before withdrawal of oil, rapeseed (variety Express) was dehulled applying a procedure developed by SKET <span class="gene">GmbH</span> Magdeburg and the Section Food-Technology of the University Essen. The steps of the dehulling procedure were described. For RM the oil was removed by the prepress-solvent procedure till a crude fat <span class="trait">content</span> of 2.1% in DM. RC was produced by pressing only resulting approximately 13% crude fat in DM. The RM and RC from not dehulled (ND) and dehulled (D) rapeseed were examined analytically. Crude nutrients, sugar and fibre substances, amino acids, some minerals and trace elements, fatty acids, glucosinolates and sinapine, and phytate were determined. By dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> the crude fibre <span class="trait">content</span> was decreased in RM and RC by approximately 40%. The ADF <span class="trait">content</span> declined by 35 and 39%, and the NDF <span class="trait">content</span> by 28% and 40% in RM and RC, respectively. The decrease in ADL <span class="trait">content</span> amounted to 50% and 65% for RM and RC, respectively. On the other hand, the CP <span class="trait">content</span> of RM and RC was increased by 7% and 13%, respectively, by dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> while the amino acid <span class="trait">content</span> of rape <span class="trait">protein</span> increased only slightly. The contents of glucosinolates and sinapine were also increased by dehulling, while the contents of phytate and phytate P were decreased. In digestibility and balance experiments with piglets and intact hybrid breeds of growing-finishing pigs, the digestibility of organic matter and of crude nutrients and the contents of digestible energy and metabolizable energy were estimated. Furthermore, the precaecal digestibility of crude nutrients and amino acids was determined with fistulated mini-pigs. By dehulling the seeds the digestibility of organic matter from RM and RC was improved in piglets and adult pigs by approximately 10%, and the ME contents increased by 13-15%. The precaecal digestibility of the sum of amino acids was increased by approximately 3 and 6 units in RM and RC, respectively. The precaecal digestibility of lysine in RM and RC reached that of soybean oil meal from not dehulled beans.

						Isoflavonoids are biologically active natural products that accumulate in soybean seeds during development. The amount of isoflavonoids present in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> is variable, depending on genetic and environmental factors that are not fully understood. Experiments were conducted to determine whether isoflavonoids are synthesized within <span class="trait">seed</span> tissues during development, or made in other plant organs and transported to the seeds where they accumulate. An analysis of isoflavonoids by HPLC detected the compounds in all organs of soybean plant, but the amount of isoflavonoids present varied depending on the tissue and developmental stage. The greatest concentrations were found in mature seeds and leaves. The 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase genes <span class="gene">IFS1</span> and <span class="gene">IFS2</span> were studied to determine their pattern of expression in different tissues and developmental stages. The highest level of expression of <span class="gene">IFS1</span> was observed in the root and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, while <span class="gene">IFS2</span> was most highly expressed in embryos and pods, and in elicitor-treated or pathogen-challenged tissues. Incorporation of radiolabel into isoflavonoids was observed when developing embryos and other plant organs were fed with [(14)C]phenylalanine. Embryos excised from developing soybean seeds also accumulated isoflavonoids from a synthetic medium. A maternal effect on <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid <span class="trait">content</span> was noted in reciprocal crosses between soybean cultivars that differ in <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoids. From these results, we propose that developing soybean embryos have an ability to synthesize isoflavonoids de novo, but that transport from maternal tissues may in part contribute to the accumulation of these natural products in the <span class="trait">seed.</span>

						A set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from soybean vars. Kefeng No.1 x Nannong 1138-2 was used to construct a genetic linkage map. The two parents exhibit contrasting characteristics for most of the traits that were mapped. Using restricted fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we mapped 452 markers onto 21 linkage groups and covered 3595.9 cM of the soybean genome. All of the linkage groups except linkage group F were consistent with those of the consensus map of Cregan et al. (1999). Linkage group F was divided into two linkage groups, F1 and F2. The map consisted of 189 RFLPs, 219 SSRs, 40 ESTs, three R gene loci and one phenotype marker. Ten agronomic traits-days to flowering, days to maturity, plant height, number of nodes on main stem, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> number of pods per node, <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> 100-seed weight, and plot yield-were studied. Using winqtlcart, we detected 63 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had LOD&gt;3 for nine of the agronomic traits (only exception being <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content)</span> and mapped these on 12 linkage groups. Most of the QTLs were clustered, especially on groups B1 and C2. Some QTLs were mapped to the same loci. This pleiotropism was common for most of the QTLs, and one QTL could influence at most five traits. Seven EST markers were found to be linked closely with or located at the same loci as the QTLs. EST marker <span class="gene">GmKF059a,</span> encoding a repressor <span class="trait">protein</span> and mapped on group C2, accounted for about 20% of the total variation of days to flowering, plant height, <span class="trait">lodging</span> and nodes on the main stem, respectively.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) seeds vary in their surface properties. The lustre, or glossiness, of seeds has been classified into several different phenotypes. Soybean seeds that have a dull lustre or moderate bloom (B) may also have abundant <span class="trait">seed</span> surface <span class="trait">protein,</span> namely, an abundance of the hydrophobic <span class="trait">protein</span> from soybean (HPS). The <span class="trait">seed</span> surface <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="gene">HPS</span> is an allergen (Gly m 1) that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. In this study, <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre and surface <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> are compared among 71 different soybean cultivars and lines. Dull-seeded phenotypes usually possessed abundant surface <span class="trait">protein</span> in comparison to shiny-seeded types, although exceptions were observed. An F2 population of 82 individuals from a cross of OX281 (dull lustre, abundant HPS) and Mukden (shiny lustre, trace amounts of HPS) provided a basis for inheritance studies and genetic mapping analysis. Results indicate that dull <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre (B) and surface <span class="trait">protein</span> (Hps) loci are dominant Mendelian traits that cosegregate and map to soybean linkage group E. Molecular markers were used to construct a genetic map of 28 cM encompassing B and Hps. Two different molecular markers cosegregated with each of the loci. This study provides additional evidence that Hps may play a role in the adhesion of endocarp tissues to the <span class="trait">seed,</span> and offers new methods of selection for <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre and surface <span class="trait">protein</span> composition in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Superior crop cultivars must be identified through multi-environment trials (MET) and on the basis of multiple traits. The objectives of this paper were to describe two types of biplots, the GGE biplot and the GT biplot, which graphically display genotype by environment data and genotype by trait data, respectively, and hence facilitate cultivar evaluation on the basis of <span class="gene">MET</span> data and multiple traits. Genotype main effect plus genotype by environment interaction effect (GGE) biplot analysis of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">yield</span> data for the 2800 crop heat unit area of Ontario for <span class="gene">MET</span> in the period 1994-1999 revealed yearly crossover genotype by site interactions. The eastern Ontario site Winchester showed a different genotype response pattern from the three southwestern Ontario sites in four of the six years. The interactions were not large enough to divide the area into different mega-environments as when analyzed over years, a single cultivar yielded the best in all four sites. The southwestern site, St. Pauls, was found to always group together with at least one of the other three sites; it did not provide unique information on genotype performance. Therefore, in future cultivar evaluations, Winchester should always be used but St. Pauls can be dismissed. Applying GT biplot to the 1994-1999 multiple trait data illustrated that GT biplots graphically displayed the interrelationships among <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> plant height, and days to maturity, among other traits, and facilitated visual cultivar comparisons and selection. It was found that selection for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> alone was not only the simplest, but also the most effective strategy in the early stages of soybean breeding.

						Raffinose oligosaccharides (RO) are the major factors responsible for flatulence following ingestion of soybean derived products. Removal of RO from seeds or soymilk would then have a positive impact on the acceptance of soy-based foods. Enzymic hydrolysis of the RO is accomplished by alpha-galactosidase. While the <span class="trait">content</span> of RO decreases during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination, the activity of alpha-galactosidase increases substantially. Two alpha-galactosidases were isolated from germinating seeds by partition in an aqueous two-phase system followed by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography. One of the enzyme preparations (P1) showed a single <span class="trait">protein</span> with M(r) of 33 kDa, and the second (P2) had two proteins with M(r) of 31 and 33 kDa. Maximal activities against the synthetic substrate rho-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (rhoNPGal) were detected at pH 5.0-5.5 and 45-50 degrees C. Both enzymes were fairly stable at 40 degrees C, but lost most of their activities after 30 min at 50 degrees C. The K(m) values for hydrolysis of rhoNPGal by the <span class="gene">P1</span> and P2 enzymes were 1.55 and 0.76 mM, respectively. The K(m) values determined for hydrolysis of raffinose and melibiose by the P2 enzyme were 5.53 and 5.34 mM, respectively and galactose was a competitive inhibitor (K(i)=0.65 mM). To different extents, both enzymes were sensitive to inhibition by galactose, melibiose, CuSO(4), and SDS. Sucrose and beta-mercaptoethanol showed discrete inhibitory effects on both enzymes.

						Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the major storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. During germination, stored reserves are used as a source of nutrients by the plant seedling. Phytic acid is degraded by the activity of phytases to <span class="trait">yield</span> inositol and free phosphate. Due to the lack of phytases in the non-ruminant digestive tract, monogastric animals cannot utilize dietary phytic acid and it is excreted into manure. High phytic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in manure results in elevated phosphorus levels in soil and water and accompanying environmental concerns. The use of phytases to degrade <span class="trait">seed</span> phytic acid has potential for reducing the negative environmental impact of livestock production. A phytase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cotyledons of germinated soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.). Peptide sequence data generated from the purified enzyme facilitated the cloning of the phytase sequence <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> employing a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The introduction of <span class="gene">GmPhy</span> into soybean tissue culture resulted in increased phytase activity in transformed cells, which confirmed the identity of the phytase gene. It is surprising that the soybean phytase was unrelated to previously characterized microbial or maize (Zea mays) phytases, which were classified as histidine acid phosphatases. The soybean phytase sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity to purple acid phosphatases, a class of metallophosphoesterases.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits of beta-conglycinin was suppressed by sequence-mediated gene silencing in transgenic soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> The resulting seeds had similar total oil and <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and ratio compared with the parent line. The decrease in beta-conglycinin <span class="trait">protein</span> was apparently compensated by an increased accumulation of glycinin. In addition, proglycinin, the precursor of glycinin, was detected as a prominent polypeptide band in the <span class="trait">protein</span> profile of the transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> extract. Electron microscopic analysis and immunocytochemistry of maturing transgenic soybean seeds indicated that the process of storage <span class="trait">protein</span> accumulation was altered in the transgenic line. In normal soybeans, the storage proteins are deposited in pre-existing vacuoles by Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, in transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> with reduced beta-conglycinin levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles were observed that resembled precursor accumulating-vesicles of pumpkin seeds and the <span class="trait">protein</span> bodies accumulated by cereal seeds. Their ER-derived membrane of the novel vesicles did not contain the <span class="trait">protein</span> storage vacuole tonoplast-specific <span class="trait">protein</span> alpha-TIP, and the sequestered polypeptides did not contain complex glycans, indicating a preGolgi and nonvacuolar nature. Glycinin was identified as a major component of these novel <span class="trait">protein</span> bodies and its diversion from normal storage <span class="trait">protein</span> trafficking appears to be related to the proglycinin buildup in the transgenic <span class="trait">seed.</span> The stable accumulation of proteins in a <span class="trait">protein</span> body compartment instead of vacuolar accumulation of proteins may provide an alternative intracellular site to sequester proteins when soybeans are used as <span class="trait">protein</span> factories.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Analysis of globulin-P, the polymerized amaranth globulin, gave a low amount of free sulfhydryls (10.2 +/- 0.5 micromol/g) from which 7 +/- 1 micromol/g was buried inside the molecule. In addition, its disulfide <span class="trait">content</span> was high (51 +/- 1 micromol/g) and similar to soybean 11S globulin <span class="trait">content.</span> The more exposed disulfide bridges were found to be stabilizing polymers, whereas the less reactive bridges were either linking P(20) and P(30) polypeptides or forming intrachain linkages. It was found that the buried bonds participate in the stabilization of folded polypeptides and the quaternary structure of the globulin. In turn, the dissociation of polymers and disruption of the quaternary structure by the action of 2-mercaptoethanol reverted upon removal of the reducing agent. This demonstrates that the polymerized state and the quaternary structure of the molecules are most favorable from the thermodynamic point of view. The similar <span class="trait">content</span> of SH and <span class="gene">SS</span> in globulin-P and globulin-S found in this laboratory suggests that the differences between these proteins may be ascribed to other compositional differences.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A variegated leaf mutant in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has been identified and characterized. E25-10 was derived by exposure of seeds of the "Williams' 82" cultivar to gamma-radiation. In this mutant, yellow leaf sectors contain defective chloroplasts, in which the thylakoid membranes are presented as long, parallel structures with little or no overlap. No starch grains have been detected in the mutant chloroplasts. Small vesicles and plastoglobuli can be found within the defective chloroplasts. Genetic studies revealed that a single nuclear-encoded gene is responsible for the mutation in E25-10. The total chlorophyll <span class="trait">content</span> is reduced in yellow leaf tissue by 70-80%. However, the chlorophyll a/b ratio is not altered. The absorbance spectrum of pigments in the mutant leaf tissue differed from that of the green extracts in the range of 400-500 nm. This reduction in total chlorophyll and the change in the absorbance spectrum pattern in the yellow tissue is related to a loss of certain photosynthetic complexes. Green gel analysis revealed that four major pigment-protein complexes (CP1, LHCP1, LHCP2, and CPa) of the thylakoid membranes were absent in the E25-10 mutant. Lithium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that at least 5-6 polypeptides (51, 44, 25, 15, 13, and 12 kDa) were missing in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts from the yellow tissue. Changes in chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded gene message levels were detected. The <span class="gene">psaA</span> transcripts which code for the P700 apoprotein in PSI were reduced in chloroplasts from the E25-10 mutant yellow tissue. The levels of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and light harvest complex <span class="trait">protein</span> (LHCP) of PSII mRNA appeared to be reduced slightly in the mutant plants. However, a much more significant reduction in the 16S rRNA and the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcS) expression was detected in the yellow leaf sectors. Our results suggest that the possible lesion in E25-10 is located in the photosystem I even though fewer grana were observed in the defective chloroplasts.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The polyunsaturated fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> is one of the major factors influencing the quality of vegetable oils. Edible oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acid provide improved oil stability, flavor, and nutrition for human and animal consumption. In plants, the microsomal omega-6 desaturase-catalyzed pathway is the primary route of production of polyunsaturated lipids. We report the isolation of two different cDNA sequences, <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FAD2-2, encoding microsomal omega-6 desaturase in soybeans and the characterization of their developmental and temperature regulation. The <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is strongly expressed in developing seeds, whereas the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene is constitutively expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. Thus, the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene-encoded omega-6 desaturase appears to be responsible for production of polyunsaturated fatty acids within membrane lipids in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. The seed-specifically expressed <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is likely to play a major role in controlling conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid within storage lipids during <span class="trait">seed</span> development. In both soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> and leaf tissues, linoleic acid and linolenic acid levels gradually increase as temperature decreases. However, the levels of transcripts for FAD2-1, FAD2-2, and the plastidial omega-6 desaturase gene (FAD 6) do not increase at low temperature. These results suggest that the elevated polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in developing soybean seeds grown at low temperature are not due to the enhanced expression of omega-6 desaturase genes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A <span class="gene">Gy4</span> glycinin cDNA was modified and used to produce structurally altered 11S storage <span class="trait">protein</span> subunits. We evaluated these modified subunits for their ability to assemble into oligomers. Alterations made in the acidic polypeptide changed the subunit solubility characteristics but did not eliminate assembly. Modifications in the basic polypeptide usually eliminated assembly of subunits into trimers. A region exhibiting high natural variability located at the COOH terminus of the acidic polypeptide that we have designated the hypervariable region was also studied. Extensive deletions and insertions were tolerated in the hypervariable region without perturbing subunit assembly. Some of the insertions significantly increased the methionine <span class="trait">content</span> in the <span class="gene">Gy4</span> glycinin subunit. Together, our results indicated that the structure of the basic polypeptide was more critical for assembly of trimers than that of the acidic polypeptide, an observation that implies that the basic polypeptides direct trimer formation. The assembly assays described here will be useful in efforts to improve <span class="trait">seed</span> quality. Using them, the effects of modifications to the storage <span class="trait">protein</span> subunits can be rapidly evaluated before introducing the mutated genes into plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Four subunits of beta-conglycinin were purified from soybean cultivar CX 635-1-1-1, and were designated alpha, alpha', beta, and beta' in accordance with nomenclature proposed by Thanh and Shibasaki [(1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 490, 370-384]. Of these subunits, beta' has not previously been reported or characterized. Consistent with the low levels of methionine in these proteins, cyanogen bromide cleavage of alpha', alpha, and beta' subunits produced only a few fragments. The beta subunit contains no methionine and was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits are homologous, and each has valine at its amino terminus. The beta subunit has a very different NH2-terminal sequence from those of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits, and has leucine at its amino terminus. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta' subunit could not be determined, as it appeared to be blocked to Edman degradation. Although alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits have similar NH2-terminal sequences, they differ in the number of methionine residues and so yielded different numbers of cyanogen bromide fragments. Two cyanogen bromide fragments (CB-1 and CB-2) were purified from the alpha subunit. CB-1 originated from the NH2-terminal end of the subunit. The amino acid sequence of CB-2 was identical to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clone pB36. The insert in pB36 encoded 216 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of the alpha subunit and contained a 138-bp trailer sequence which was followed by a poly-(A) tail. Maps showing the relative positions of methionine residues and carbohydrate moieties in the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits were drawn, based on primary sequence data, and the size and carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of the CNBr fragments derived from the subunits.

						Exogenous Spm-treatment in both cultivars decreased <span class="gene">SS</span> activity from 0 to 10 d of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. This decreased percentage was 13%, 23% and 22% in cv. &#x02018;Ladino&#x02019; at 0, 5, and 10 d of treatment, respectively, and 13%, 14% and 14% in cv. &#x02018;Haifa&#x02019;, correspondingly ( <xref rid="pone.0120708.g005" ref-type="fig"> Fig. 5A </xref> ). SPS activity was relatively unchanged or slightly increased in non-treated plants (&#x02018;H&#x02019; or &#x02018;L&#x02019;) during <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, but obviously increased by 69% or 33% in &#x02018;L+Spm&#x02019; or &#x02018;H+Spm&#x02019; treatment after 10 d of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Accordingly, significant differences of SPS activities between Spm-treated plants (&#x02018;L+Spm&#x02019; or &#x02018;H+Spm&#x02019;) and non-treated plants (&#x02018;L&#x02019; or &#x02018;H&#x02019;) were observed at 5 and 10 d of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress ( <xref rid="pone.0120708.g005" ref-type="fig"> Fig. 5B </xref> ).

						Water deficit particularly leads to increase the accumulation of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) including sucrose, fructose, and glucose in plants. Sucrose is critical for energy source and plays an important role in maintaining hydrophilic structures of proteins and stabilization of cell membrane when plant is subject to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref047" ref-type="bibr"> 47 </xref> ]. Fructose and glucose under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress not only has been proved to be important compatible osmolytes involved in decreasing osmotic potential but also could function as raw materials of carbon metabolism, or as initiate signal transduction factors in stress signaling pathway [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref048" ref-type="bibr"> 48 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref049" ref-type="bibr"> 49 </xref> ]. Al Hakimi et al. [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref050" ref-type="bibr"> 50 </xref> ] and Kaur et al. [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref048" ref-type="bibr"> 48 </xref> ] presumed that the accumulation of soluble sugars in wheat was one of the main features to improve <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance. Previous reports have shown that PAs was concerned with carbohydrate metabolism under multiple abiotic stresses. Spd effectively alleviated chill-induced metabolic disturbance of carbohydrate in leaves of spinach [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref051" ref-type="bibr"> 51 </xref> ]. Exogenous Put improved <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance of wheat by increasing accumulation of soluble sugar in leaves [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref052" ref-type="bibr"> 52 </xref> ]. In the current study, Spm application led to accumulation of high levels of WSC, sucrose and fructose in both white clover cultivars under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Exogenous Spm also significantly elevated glucose <span class="trait">content</span> in leaves of drought-resistant cv. &#x02018;Haifa&#x02019;, but had no effect on drought-susceptible cv. &#x02018;Ladino&#x02019;. It suggests that there are differences between drought-resistant and-susceptible white clover cultivars related to Spm regulation of WSC accumulation. Sucrose synthetase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) regulated sucrose metabolism in plants [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref053" ref-type="bibr"> 53 </xref> ]. <span class="gene">SS</span> plays a central role in secondary metabolism of sucrose. When plants are subjected to chilling, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and salt stress, <span class="gene">SS</span> will catalyze the synthesis of sucrose by using glucose and fructose as substrates. However, this catalytic process is reversible, which means <span class="gene">SS</span> also could decompose sucrose into glucose and fructose [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref054" ref-type="bibr"> 54 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref055" ref-type="bibr"> 55 </xref> ]. The activity of <span class="gene">SS</span> changed with duration of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress or degree of water deficit because of the function of <span class="gene">SS</span> in catalyzing both sucrose synthesis and degradation [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref056" ref-type="bibr"> 56 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref057" ref-type="bibr"> 57 </xref> ]. The difference between <span class="gene">SS</span> and SPS is that SPS is located in the cytoplasm, only catalyzes sucrose synthesis and is involved in the most critical synthetic route of sucrose in higher plants. Additionally, SPS is widely implicated in many stress response mechanisms [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref058" ref-type="bibr"> 58 </xref> ]. Yang et al. [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref059" ref-type="bibr"> 59 </xref> ] and Fresneau et al. [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref058" ref-type="bibr"> 58 </xref> ] found that <span class="trait">drought</span> induced an increase in SPS activity of rice and wheat. Under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, exogenous Spm significantly increased SPS activity, but decreased <span class="gene">SS</span> activity in both white clover cultivars. This agrees with the early report of Kaur et al [ <xref rid="pone.0120708.ref048" ref-type="bibr"> 48 </xref> ]: higher sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> along with a higher SPS activity and a lower <span class="gene">SS</span> activity could be responsible for <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance in wheat. Altogether, it may suggest that the increase of Spm-induced sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> depends on SPS under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, while <span class="gene">SS</span> has more possibilities to be involved in the balance between sucrose synthesis and degradation.

In our study, Dof22 and Dof24 genes were upregulated in the HiPro soy line, but no significant difference was seen in the transcript abundance for Dof4 and Dof11 in either genotype (data not shown).
					</p>

						It has long been documented that <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil <span class="trait">content</span> are inversely correlated in the soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61"> 61 </xref> ]. Low oil alleles are consistently cotransmitted with high <span class="trait">protein</span> alleles in many instances [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62"> 62 </xref> ], and attempts to separate these two traits through chromosomal recombination in the NILs used in this study have not been successful [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref> ]. It has been hypothesized that this relationship may be due to either very tight linkage or pleiotropic effects [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref> ]. Whether one phenotype directly or indirectly results in the other is unknown, and the timing of events regarding differential accumulation of contrasting <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil levels in the <span class="trait">seed</span> is uncertain. <span class="gene">GmDof4</span> and <span class="gene">GmDof11</span> transcription factors, however, have been reported to activate genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and simultaneously suppress the expression of storage <span class="trait">protein</span> genes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56"> 56 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We identified 14 genes mapping to the <span class="trait">protein</span> QTL region at LG I that may play a role in the regulation of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil. Thirteen of these 14 genes displayed differentially accumulating transcripts. Of these 13, 11 were found at high levels in the low <span class="trait">protein</span> line with low or no detectable levels in the high <span class="trait">protein</span> line. Based on sequence homology searches to <span class="trait">protein</span> databases, these candidates include a potential regulatory <span class="trait">protein</span> in the <span class="gene">Mov34-1</span> family, a heat shock <span class="trait">protein</span> Hsp22.5, and an ATP synthase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"> 3 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Although the <span class="gene">Mov34-1</span> candidate appeared to possess versatile domains for the potential regulation of multiple processes, transcripts isolated from this candidate region contained numerous stop codons, raising the possibility of non-coding genes. The same was true for a number of the other candidates and may account for the high percentage of genes with no significant E-value returns to the Uniprot <span class="trait">protein</span> database [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86"> 86 </xref> ]. There is increasing evidence for the role of riboregulators, either as long non-protein coding RNAs or processed into small RNAs in plant development [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87"> 87 </xref> ], and these molecules may play a role in <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> and oil accumulation. Two pairs of genes among the candidates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ) were found to possess overlapping transcripts; one possibility is that these overlapping transcripts form double-stranded RNAs that may be processed into small RNAs [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88"> 88 </xref> ].

						In soybean, six independent loci ( <italic> I, T, R, Wp, W1, </italic> and <italic> O </italic> ) control the color and distribution of pigments ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ; <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr"> Palmer and Kilen, 1987 </xref> ; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr"> Gillman et al., 2011 </xref> ). The best characterized <italic> I </italic> locus (for <italic> inhibitor </italic> , ecoding chalcone synthase) inhibits the production and accumulation of anthocyanins and PAs in the epidermal layer of the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> Bernard and Weiss, 1973 </xref> ). An allelic series for the <italic> I </italic> gene is present in soybean, where the absence of pigmentation is controlled by the dominant allele at the <italic> I </italic> locus, whereas the homozygous recessive <italic> ii </italic> genotype produces a totally pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, and the alternate <italic> i <sup> i </sup> </italic> allele results in pigmentation of the hilum ( <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr"> Tuteja et al., 2004 </xref> ). Most cultivated soybean varieties are homozygous for the <italic> I </italic> gene, resulting in a yellow <span class="trait">seed</span> coat. To date, eight chalcone synthase genes have been identified in soybean, all expressed in <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (reviewed in <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr"> Mo&#x000ef;se et al., 2005 </xref> ). Chalcone synthase is the first enzyme of the branched pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ), and it plays a role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites functioning as UV protectants, phytoalexins, insect repellents, and symbiosis initiators in various plant tissues. Another locus, <italic> T </italic> , affects pubescence and hilum colors, and it induces <span class="trait">seed</span> coat cracking. It encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the formation of quercetin from kaempferol ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) and is responsible for the hydroxylation of the 3&#x02032;position of flavonoids, leading to the production of cyanidin pigments ( <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2003 </xref> ). The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> locus controls flower color and affects <span class="trait">seed</span> color only in an <italic> iRT </italic> background, where <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> and <italic> w1 </italic> alleles give imperfect black and buff <span class="trait">seed</span> coat colors, respectively. The <italic> <span class="gene">W1</span> </italic> allele encodes flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase ( <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2007 </xref> ) and causes purple flower. The <italic> Wp </italic> locus was suggested to code for the flavanone 3-hydroxylase ( <bold> Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> </bold> ) based on microarray analysis ( <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr"> Zabala and Vodkin, 2005 </xref> ), where the recessive <italic> wp </italic> allele resulted in change from black ( <italic> iRTWp </italic> ) to light grayish ( <italic> irtwp </italic> ) color. The <italic> O </italic> locus affects the color of brown <span class="trait">seed</span> coat ( <italic> irTO </italic> ) and has been suggested to code for ANR ( <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr"> Yang et al., 2010 </xref> ). Finally, the <italic> R </italic> locus controls the presence ( <italic> R </italic> ) or absence ( <italic> r </italic> ) of anthocyanins in black ( <italic> iRT </italic> ) or brown ( <italic> irT </italic> ) <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, respectively ( <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr"> Nagai, 1921 </xref> ). The up-regulation of anthocyanidin synthase genes suggests that the <italic> R </italic> locus codes for a regulatory factor ( <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr"> Kovinich et al., 2011 </xref> ). Comparably less is known about pigmentation in pea, especially in relation to the testa. Mendel&#x02019;s <italic> A </italic> gene, conferring pea flower color and testa pigmentation, has been recently identified as a bHLH TF, exerting thus pleiotropic effects on flower, leaf axils and testa pigmentation ( <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr"> Hellens et al., 2010 </xref> ). However, these traits can be genetically uncoupled, e.g., pea with colored flowers can have nearly non-pigmented <span class="trait">seed</span> coat (Sm&#x000fd;kal, unpublished). The <italic> b </italic> gene of pea was shown to encode a defective flavonoid 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-hydroxylase, conferring pink flower color ( <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr"> Moreau et al., 2012 </xref> ). However, none of these two mutations result in alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy, since they have been identified in cultivated pea lines. Also in lupin, besides the hard-seeded gene <italic> Mollis </italic> , the blue flower and dark <span class="trait">seed</span> color gene <italic> Leucospermus </italic> ( <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr"> Clements et al., 2005 </xref> ) confers domestication trait. Although truly wild <italic> Vicia faba </italic> has not identified, a locus was found to be involved in <span class="trait">seed</span> dormancy (i.e., <italic> doz </italic> ) linked to a locus controlling anthocyanin and pro-anthocyanidin synthesis (i.e., <italic> sp-v </italic> ; <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr"> Ramsay, 1997 </xref> ). Finally, in <italic> Trifolium subterraneum </italic> seeds, a relationship between color, phenolic <span class="trait">content</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat impermeability was found ( <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr"> Slattery et al., 1982 </xref> ).

						Due to their high <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and relatively low cost, soybeans ( <italic> Glycine max </italic> (L.) Merr.) are used as an animal feed throughout the world. <span class="trait">Protein</span> accounts for about 40% of the dry weight of soybean seeds. The abundant storage proteins of soybean are the salt-soluble globulins, the 7S &#x003b2;-conglycinin and the 11S glycinin, which together could account for about 70% of the total <span class="trait">seed</span> proteins (Nielsen, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr"> 1996 </xref> ; Nielsen and Nam, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr"> 1999 </xref> ; Krishnan, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr"> 2000 </xref> ). Both these classes of proteins are encoded by multiple gene families (Harada et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> ; Nielsen et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> ). Glycinins are hexameric proteins that are classified into two groups based on DNA sequence similarities (Nielsen et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> ). Group-1 glycinins contain three genes, <italic> <span class="gene">Gy1</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">Gy2</span> </italic> , and <italic> Gy3 </italic> , while group-2 glycinins include two genes, <italic> <span class="gene">Gy4</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Gy5</span> </italic> . In addition, two genes, <italic> <span class="gene">Gy7</span> </italic> and <italic> Gy6 </italic> , resembling group-1 glycinins are also present (Beilinson et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> 2002 </xref> ). The expression of <italic> <span class="gene">Gy7</span> </italic> gene is significantly lower than other <italic> Gy </italic> genes while the Gy6 has been identified as a pseudogene (Beilinson et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> 2002 </xref> ). Each of the glycinins is synthesized as a precursor <span class="trait">protein</span> that is subsequently cleaved into acidic and basic subunits (Staswick et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"> 1984 </xref> ). &#x003b2;-conglycinin consists &#x003b1;&#x02032;, &#x003b1;, and &#x003b2; subunits (Coates et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> 1985 </xref> ). Unlike the glycinins, the &#x003b2;-conglycinins are glycoproteins (Thanh and Shibasaki, <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr"> 1978 </xref> ). Because of their abundance, the 7S and 11S globulins are mainly responsible for the nutritional quality of soybeans.

						Mapping markers have evolved from morphological markers to isoenzyme marker to random DNA markers and now to gene targeted functional markers developed from polymorphic sites within genes. Although the use of some recently developed marker techniques in plant sciences is not yet as extensive as that of well established methods such as SSR markers, the number of studies utilizing these advanced methods is rapidly increasing [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"> 5 </xref> ]. In this report, we demonstrate four interesting features of miR1511-InDel marker. Firstly, miR1511-InDel is part of a new class of small RNAs (miRNAs) that are single copy number and from which we were able to make inferences about genetic diversity within the subgenus Glycine. Secondly, marker developed from miRNA can be developed easily with efficient detection though detection of miRNA is difficult. It is evidence that this miR1511-InDel marker could be distinguished on the presence or absence of miR1511 due to allelic variation within the pre-miR1511 in soybean germplasm. Thirdly, miR1511-InDel is a functional marker as miRNAs play in functional roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotes and viruses [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"> 26 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36"> 36 </xref> ]. In addition, it has been confirmed that there are anti co-expression between miR1511 and <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4a</span> </italic> in different tissue [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ]. In addition, there are anti co-expression between miR1511/miR1511* and <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4a</span> </italic> under <span class="trait">drought</span> treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media"> 4 </xref> : Figure S4). Recently, it has been reported that loss-of-function mutants of <italic> RPL4A </italic> , rpl4a, which were initially identified as a mutant with altered trafficking of vacuolar targeted proteins, display auxin-related developmental defect phenotypes such as narrow pointed first leaves and retarded growth [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37"> 37 </xref> ]. Fourthly, miR1511-InDel is soybean-specific as confirmed by the existence of complementary strand of miR1511 (miR1511*) and verified by its target cleavage site ( <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4a</span> </italic> ) [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ] yet found in any other crop. <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4a</span> </italic> belongs to 60S ribosomal <span class="trait">protein</span> L4 family and is homologous to <italic> RPL4a </italic> in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> which is involved in plastid transcriptional regulation [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38"> 38 </xref> ]. Furthermore, there was no sequence match for pre-miR1511 in <italic> P. vulgaris </italic> (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media"> 3 </xref> : Figure S3) and the flanking region of target gene cleavage site in <italic> P. vulgaris </italic> was diverged from that of soybean. Moreover, there was no sequence match to mature miR1511 in <italic> P.valgaris </italic> and there were three SNPs at miR1511* (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media"> 5 </xref> : Figure S5).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The first miRNAs, Lin-4 and Let-7, were discovered as the components of developmental pathways in <italic> Caenorhabditis elegans </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39"> 39 </xref> &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41"> 41 </xref> ]. Since then many studies have found and elucidated the roles of miRNAs in diverse species, including plants. The evolutionary history of miRNA genes has been well characterized in animals, for example the formation of the miR-17 cluster [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42"> 42 </xref> ] and the imprinted miR-134 gene cluster at human locus 14q32 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43"> 43 </xref> &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45"> 45 </xref> ]. With the increasing number of identified miRNAs by bioinformatics prediction and deep sequencing, species specific or non conserved miRNAs have been found in rice [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46"> 46 </xref> ], <italic> Medicago truncatula </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47"> 47 </xref> ] and soybean [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"> 31 </xref> ]. It has been suggested that as the majority of these are restricted to closely related species and many could be species specific. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that plants harbor relatively large numbers of recently born miRNA loci [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48"> 48 </xref> ]. In plants, some miRNAs and their target genes have been conserved since the last common ancestor of bryophytes and <span class="trait">seed</span> plants more than 400 million years ago [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49"> 49 </xref> ]. Evolution of miRNA genes in plant are thought to originate via three modes: i) produced by inverted duplication of target gene sequences [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref> ]; ii) generated from inverted repeat transposable elements [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51"> 51 </xref> ]; and iii) spawned from random foldback sequences (&#x0201c;spontaneous evolution&#x0201d;) [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52"> 52 </xref> ]. In this study, the miR1511 foldback lack extended similarity or complementary to the target gene, <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4a</span> </italic> , [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ] or any other of the predicted target gene sequence. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the hypothesis of inverted duplication in which the foldback arms of recently evolved miRNA genes containing relatively long sequences similar to target gene sequences [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref> ]. Transposable element-derived miRNAs have the potential to regulate multiple genes via homologous target sites dispersed throughout the genome [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51"> 51 </xref> ]. The target gene of miR1511 has another copy, <italic> <span class="gene">GmRPL4d</span> </italic> , that was not cleaved by miR1511, as determined by 5' RACE [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ], and thus may not be derived from a transposon. It is possible that miR1511 could be derived from random foldback sequences. Thus, by chance, miR1511 could be a newly spawned and species-specific miRNA as even some of the closely related wild species, <italic> miR1511-InDel-1a </italic> , lack the mature miR1511 sequence (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1 </xref> ).

						In our previous study [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref040" ref-type="bibr"> 40 </xref> ], <italic> GsCML27 </italic> was identified as a putative bicarbonate stress (50mM NaHCO <sub> 3 </sub> , pH8.5) responsive gene, by transcriptome sequencing data of the wild type soybean <italic> Glycine soja </italic> G07256 ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material"> S1 Fig </xref> ). In this study, the full-length CDS of <italic> GsCML27 </italic> was obtained by homologous cloning with gene-specific primers designed according to the transcript sequence of <italic> Glycine max </italic> homolog <span class="gene">(Glyma08g05810).</span> <italic> GsCML27 </italic> contains an open reading frame of 543 bp that encoded a <span class="trait">protein</span> of 181 residues with a predicted molecular weight of 19.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.32.

						We firstly performed the plate germination assays to determine the stress tolerance of WT and <italic> GsCML27 </italic> ectopic expression <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> lines ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4B </xref> ). Under standard culture conditions, <italic> GsCML27 </italic> ectopic expression lines exhibited similar <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and early seedling growth with WT, suggesting that <italic> GsCML27 </italic> did not affect <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and early seedling development ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4C </xref> ). However, under 10 mM NaHCO <sub> 3 </sub> stress treatment, <italic> GsCML27 </italic> ectopic expression lines displayed higher <span class="trait">seed</span> germination rates ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4C </xref> ) and more seedlings with open and green leaves ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4D </xref> ) than WT. Unexpectedly, on 1/2 <span class="gene">MS</span> medium containing 125 mM NaCl or 300 mM mannitol, WT exhibited better at <span class="trait">seed</span> germination ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4C </xref> ) and seedlings growth ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g004" ref-type="fig"> Fig 4D </xref> ), as evidenced by higher <span class="trait">seed</span> germination rates and more seedlings with open and green leaves than ectopic expression lines. These results demonstrated that <italic> GsCML27 </italic> enhanced plant tolerance to bicarbonate stress, but decreased the salt and osmotic tolerance.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Studies have revealed both <italic> GsTIFY10 </italic> and <italic> AtTIFY10 </italic> have positive function in alkaline responses [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref052" ref-type="bibr"> 52 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref053" ref-type="bibr"> 53 </xref> ]. Overexpression of <italic> GhWRKY25 </italic> in <italic> Nicotiana benthamiana </italic> enhances plant tolerance to salt stress [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref054" ref-type="bibr"> 54 </xref> ], overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">WRKY25</span> </italic> is also sufficient to increase <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> NaCl tolerance [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref055" ref-type="bibr"> 55 </xref> ]. In this study, GsCML27 shared the highest amino acid similarity with AtCML27 (61.7%) among the 50 CML proteins in reference plant <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref033" ref-type="bibr"> 33 </xref> ]. Similar to AtCML27 and other <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> CMLs proteins, GsCML27 contains four conserved EF-hand motifs ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g001" ref-type="fig"> Fig 1A </xref> ). So we indicate that <italic> AtCML27 </italic> may have similar function with <italic> GsCML27 </italic> . Studies have shown <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> CML8 [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref056" ref-type="bibr"> 56 </xref> ] and CML24 [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref057" ref-type="bibr"> 57 </xref> ] have Ca <sup> 2+ </sup> -binding ability so that they can take part in signaling transduction in response to diverse stimuli. As expected, we also verified the Ca <sup> 2+ </sup> -binding property of GsCML27 <span class="trait">protein</span> through the far-UV CD spectroscopy ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g002" ref-type="fig"> Fig 2A </xref> ).

						Salinity exerts negative impact mainly by disrupting the cell ionic and osmotic equilibrium [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref068" ref-type="bibr"> 68 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref069" ref-type="bibr"> 69 </xref> ]. The decreased tolerance under osmotic stress suggested that <italic> GsCML27 </italic> was involved in osmotic regulation under salt stress. To explore whether <italic> GsCML27 </italic> affected salt tolerance only by osmotic regulation or by both ionic and osmotic regulation, we carried out the plate germination assays under KCl and LiCl treatments ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g005" ref-type="fig"> Fig 5 </xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141888.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material"> S2 Fig </xref> ). Our results revealed that besides osmotic regulation, <italic> GsCML27 </italic> might also affect plant tolerance by modifying intracellular Na <sup> + </sup> /K <sup> + </sup> <span class="trait">content</span> [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref018" ref-type="bibr"> 18 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref070" ref-type="bibr"> 70 </xref> ]. In line with our studies, <italic> CML24 </italic> was found to participate in plant responses to ion stress [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref035" ref-type="bibr"> 35 </xref> ]. AtCML18 interacted with AtNHX1 (a vacuolar Na <sup> + </sup> /H <sup> + </sup> antiporter) in a Ca <sup> 2+ </sup> /pH-dependent manner, and repressed the Na <sup> + </sup> /H <sup> + </sup> exchange activity [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref036" ref-type="bibr"> 36 </xref> ]. The expression levels of <italic> CML37 </italic> , <italic> CML38 </italic> and <italic> CML39 </italic> also induced by osmotic stress [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref038" ref-type="bibr"> 38 </xref> ]. Moreover, we showed that <italic> GsCML27 </italic> ectopic expression also down-regulated expression of osmotic responsive genes, such as <italic> <span class="gene">P5CS</span> </italic> , <italic> COR47 </italic> , and <italic> RD22 </italic> ( <xref rid="pone.0141888.g006" ref-type="fig"> Fig 6 </xref> ). It is not known, however, how important the mechanisms under salt stress will be an important area for further studies.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						All <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> seeds were surfaced-sterilized as described [ <xref rid="pone.0141888.ref082" ref-type="bibr"> 82 </xref> ]. During the <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and early seedling growth stage, the wild-type (WT) and ectopic expression seeds were sown on either normal 1/2 agar <span class="gene">MS</span> medium, or 1/2 <span class="gene">MS</span> medium, supplemented with either 10 mM NaHCO <sub> 3 </sub> , or 125 mM NaCl, or 300 mM mannitol, or KCl (50, 100, 150 mM) or LiCl (10, 20, 30 mM). The germination rates were recorded for consecutive 6 days after sowing. On the 7 <sup> th </sup> day, photos were taken to show the seedling growth performance, and the numbers of seedlings with open and green leaves were recorded.

						For sucrose a similar procedure of <span class="trait">seed</span> grinding was followed as indicated above. Briefly, about 25 g of <span class="trait">seed</span> from each replicate were ground by a Laboratory Mill 3600 (Perten, Springfield, IL). <span class="trait">Seed</span> sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> was determined by <span class="gene">NIR</span> (Wilcox and Shibles, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr"> 2001 </xref> ; Bellaloui et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> 2010b </xref> ). The calibration equation was developed by the Department of Agronomy and Plant Genetics, University of Minnesota St Paul, MN, using Thermo Galactic Grams PLS IQ software, and developed by Perten company (Perten, Springfield, IL) based on methods of Biermann and McGinnis ( <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> ) and Churms et al. ( <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> 1982 </xref> ). This method was based on the conversion of sucrose to fructose and glucose using enzyme Invertase (&#x003b2;-fructosidase), and then the glucose produced measured by the hexokinase methods (Biermann and McGinnis, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> 1989 </xref> ). Sucrose measurement was based on dry matter basis (Wilcox and Shibles, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr"> 2001 </xref> ; Boydak et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"> 2002 </xref> ; Bellaloui et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> 2010b </xref> ).

						<span class="trait">Seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> and oleic acid were higher in the breeding lines with HG (34-3-1-2-4-1, 30-1-4-1-1, 25-1-1-1-1-4, and 24-2-1-2-1-2) than in the non-exotic checks for the non-delayed harvest (H1) in 2010 and 2011 (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"> 5 </xref> ). The HG lines showed different levels of <span class="trait">seed</span> composition components in 2010 and 2011(Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"> 5 </xref> ). Harvest time showed effects on oleic acid, as it declined for all lines, except LD00-3309 between H2 and H3, after delayed harvests, especially at <span class="gene">H3</span> (28 days after initial harvest). <span class="trait">Seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> decline was observed in only some genotypes. Total B (TB) and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat B (SCB) were higher in the HG breeding lines (34-3-1-2-4-1, 30-1-4-1-1, 25-1-1-1-1-4, and 24-2-1-2-1-2) compared to the non-exotic checks, and all parents (PI587982A, DT98-9102, DT97-4290, PI603756, and 5601T) for the <span class="gene">H1</span> harvest in 2010 and 2011 (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"> 5 </xref> ). Generally, TB and SCB decreased in all genotypes after delays in harvest, especially after 28 days of delayed harvest (H3). However, the level of SCB in HG lines was higher after <span class="gene">H3</span> compared with the non-exotic checks (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5"> 5 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						When the data were expressed based on the two genotypic backgrounds (exotic genotypic background vs. and non-exotic genotypic background), the results showed that <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein,</span> oleic acid, TB, SCB, Lig, fructose, germination, and accelerated aging were higher in the exotic lines compared to the non-exotic lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> ). Oil was higher in the non-exotic lines than in the exotic lines. Differences in sucrose were not significant at the <span class="gene">H1</span> or H2 harvests; however, it was higher in exotic breeding lines compared to check varieties at 28 after harvest maturity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"> 2 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The role of <span class="trait">seed</span> coat lignin (lig) for <span class="trait">seed</span> composition, germination, vigor, and <span class="trait">seed</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat physical and chemical properties was previously reported by Pereira et al. ( <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr"> 1985 </xref> ), Alvarez et al. ( <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> 1997 </xref> ), Romkaew et al. ( <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr"> 2008 </xref> ), Bellaloui et al. ( <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> 2012b </xref> ), Baldoni et al. ( <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> 2013 </xref> ), and de Oliveira et al. ( <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> 2014 </xref> ). However, in these studies, there were no lines with HG. Therefore, the objective of this research was to advance our knowledge of boron nutrition and further understand the relationships between <span class="trait">seed</span> coat B and Lig to <span class="trait">seed</span> nutrition and <span class="trait">seed</span> germinability under high heat conditions using HG lines. Our results show that all HG lines had high Lig at full maturity, but the <span class="trait">content</span> of Lig declined with delays in harvest even in the HG lines, being the lowest at 28 days after initial harvest. However, the <span class="trait">content</span> of Lig in the HG lines was significantly higher than that in the non-exotic checks, even after 28 days from initial harvest, indicating that Lig could be associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and health of the <span class="trait">seed.</span> <span class="trait">Seed</span> coat lignin in HG lines was accompanied by significantly less <span class="trait">seed</span> coat wrinkling at the <span class="gene">H1</span> harvest compared with the non-exotic checks, even at 28 days after initial harvest. <span class="trait">Seed</span> coat lignin <span class="trait">content</span> was different between lines due to genotypic differences.

						This study analysed the contribution of each omega-3 desaturase to the cold response in soybean. Exposure to cold temperatures (5 &#x000b0;C) did not result in great modifications of the linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in leaf membrane lipids. However, an increase in the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> </italic> transcripts was observed both in plant leaves and soybean cells whereas no changes in <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3B</span> </italic> or <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3C</span> </italic> expression levels were detected. This increase was reversible and accompanied by the accumulation of an mRNA encoding a truncated form of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A-T</span> </italic> ), which originated from alternative splicing of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> </italic> in response to cold. When the expression of plastidial omega-3 desaturases was analysed, a transient accumulation of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD7-2</span> </italic> mRNA was detected upon cold exposure in mature soybean trifoliate leaves while <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD7-1</span> </italic> transcripts remained unchanged. No modification of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD8-2</span> </italic> transcripts was observed. The functionality of <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A, <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3B, <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3C</span> and <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A-T was examined by heterologous expression in yeast. No activity was detected with <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A-T, consistent with the absence of one of the His boxes necessary for desaturase activity. The linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> of <italic> Sacharomyces cerevisiae </italic> cells overexpressing <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> or <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> was higher when the cultures were incubated at cooler temperatures, suggesting that reticular desaturases of the <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3</span> family, and more specifically <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A, may play a role in the cold response, even in leaves. The data point to a regulatory mechanism of omega-3 fatty acid desaturases in soybean affecting specific isoforms in both the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum to maintain appropriate levels of linolenic acid under low temperature conditions.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The additional transcript bands detected during the course of the expression analysis of the genes encoding omega-3 desaturases in response to low temperatures were also studied. To analyse their molecular origin in detail, these bands were excised from the agarose gels, purified, cloned in a pGEM-T-Easy vector, and sequenced. In the case of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> </italic> , analysis of the lower size band revealed that the only difference between the two bands was the processing of a small intron (130bp) present in the 5'-untranscribed region, 5bp upstream of the ATG of the <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD8-1</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> Fig. 5A </xref> ). The splicing of this intron might eliminate a canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence located 7bp upstream of the ATG, suggesting that it could be related with control of the translation of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> </italic> mRNA. This splicing mechanism seemed to operate independently of temperature since the intron was detected both in control and cold-exposed samples.

						Yeast has been proven as a suitable heterologous expression system for studying the functionality of endoplasmic reticulum desaturases such as <span class="gene">FAD3</span> ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009"> Dyer <italic> et al. </italic> , 2001 </xref> ). In the presence of the appropriate substrates (18:2), the <span class="gene">FAD3</span> enzymes expressed in yeast can obtain reducing power and electrons for the omega-3 desaturase activity ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009"> Dyer <italic> et al. </italic> , 2001 </xref> ). Unfortunately, these studies are not suited for the analysis of plastid desaturases as they require electron transport chains from the chloroplast ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035"> Shanklin <italic> et al. </italic> , 1994 </xref> ). The current study decided to take advantage of the yeast system to further analyse the functionality of <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A, <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3B, <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3C, and <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A-T as a function of temperature. To this end, these four isoforms of <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3</span> were expressed in <italic> S. cerevisiae </italic> under the galactose-inducible yeast promoter of the pYES2 vector. The fatty acid analysis of transformed yeast cells revealed a high quantity of linoleic acid (18:2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hwmaint.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content-embargo/full/ers174/DC1"> Supplementary Fig. S2 </ext-link> ), which was not present in the wild-type yeast (data not shown), showing a correct uptake of the supplemented substrate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> shows the fatty acid compositions of yeast cells transformed with <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3B,</span> <span class="gene">GmFAD3C</span> </italic> , and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A-T</span> </italic> using the pYES2 vector. The fatty acid analysis of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A-</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3B-</span> </italic> transformed yeast cells showed the presence of linolenic acid (18:3) that was present neither in wild-type yeast nor in cells transformed with the empty vector. The percentage of 18:3 obtained with the inducible pYES2 vector at normal yeast growth temperature (30 &#x000b0;C) was 3.8, 6.2, and 0.9% for <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3A, <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3B, and <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3C, respectively ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> ). The percentage of 18:3 obtained was consistent with similar data from the literature ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009"> Dyer <italic> et al. </italic> , 2001 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031"> O&#x02019;Quin <italic> et al. </italic> , 2010 </xref> ). These results indicate that the expression of the three genes is functional, as they code for isoforms capable of desaturating exogenous substrate to produce the corresponding 18:3. Under the experimental conditions, the 18:3 <span class="trait">content</span> of yeast cells overexpressing <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> was slightly higher than that obtained for <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> at yeast growth temperature ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> ). By contrast, in the case of <italic> Gm </italic> FAD3C, it was always significantly lower than that obtained in yeast transformed with <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> or <italic> Gm </italic> <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> under the same experimental conditions ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> ). No production of 18:3 was detected in yeast cells transformed with <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A-T</span> </italic> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> Table 1 </xref> ), even though the 18:2 levels were similar to those from yeast cells transformed with <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3A,</span> <span class="gene">GmFAD3B</span> </italic> , or <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3C</span> </italic> , indicating that the absence of 18:3 was not due to the low availability of 18:2 as a substrate. Similar results were obtained with the pVT102-U vector, which carries a constitutive promoter ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0041"> Vernet <italic> et al. </italic> , 1987 </xref> ), except that lower 18:3 percentages were routinely obtained (data not shown).
