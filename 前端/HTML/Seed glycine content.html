				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is the world's most important leguminous crop producing high-quality protein and oil. Elevating oil accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> is always many researchers' goal. WRINKLED1 (WRI1) encodes a transcription factor of the APETALA2/ethylene responsive element-binding protein (AP2/EREBP) family that plays important roles during plant <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation. In this study, we isolated and characterized three distinct orthologues of <span class="gene">WRI1</span> in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) that display different organ-specific expression patterns, among which <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> was highly expressed in maturing soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> protein was capable of binding to AW-box, a conserved sequence in the proximal upstream regions of many genes involved in various steps of oil biosynthesis. Transgenic soybean seeds overexpressing <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter showed the increased total oil and fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> and the changed fatty acid composition. Furthermore, basing on the activated expressions in transgenic soybean seeds and existence of AW-box element in the promoter regions, direct downstream genes of <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> were identified, and their products were responsible for fatty acid production, elongation, desaturation and export from plastid. We conclude that <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> transcription factor can positively regulate oil accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> by a complex gene expression network related to fatty acid biosynthesis.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						During ongoing proteomic analysis of the soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr) germplasm collection, PI 603408 was identified as a landrace whose seeds lack accumulation of one of the major <span class="trait">seed</span> storage glycinin protein subunits. Whole genomic resequencing was used to identify a two-base deletion affecting glycinin 5 The newly discovered deletion was confirmed to be causative through immunological, genetic, and proteomic analysis, and no significant differences in total <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> were found to be due to the glycinin 5 loss-of-function mutation per se In addition to focused studies on this one specific glycinin subunit-encoding gene, a total of 1,858,185 nucleotide variants were identified, of which 39,344 were predicted to affect protein coding regions. In order to semiautomate analysis of a large number of soybean gene variants, a new SIFT 4G (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerated 4 Genomes) database was designed to predict the impact of nonsynonymous single nucleotide soybean gene variants, potentially enabling more rapid analysis of soybean resequencing data in the future.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.] is the number one oil and protein crop in the United States, but the <span class="trait">seed</span> contains several anti-nutritional factors that are toxic to both humans and livestock. RNA interference technology has become an increasingly popular technique in gene silencing because it allows for both temporal and spatial targeting of specific genes. The objective of this research is to use RNA-mediated gene silencing to down-regulate the soybean gene raffinose synthase 2 (RS2), to reduce total raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> in mature <span class="trait">seed.</span> Raffinose is a trisaccharide that is indigestible to humans and monogastric animals, and as monogastric animals are the largest consumers of soy products, reducing raffinose would improve the nutritional quality of soybean. An RNAi construct targeting <span class="gene">RS2</span> was designed, cloned, and transformed to the soybean genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Resulting plants were analyzed for the presence and number of copies of the transgene by PCR and Southern blot. The efficiency of mRNA silencing was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Total raffinose <span class="trait">content</span> was determined by HPLC analysis. Transgenic plant lines were recovered that exhibited dramatically reduced levels of raffinose in mature <span class="trait">seed,</span> and these lines were further analyzed for other phenotypes such as development and <span class="trait">yield.</span> Additionally, a precision-fed rooster assay was conducted to measure the true metabolizable energy (TME) in full-fat soybean meal made from the wild-type or transgenic low-raffinose soybean lines. Transgenic low-raffinose soy had a measured TME of 2,703 kcal/kg, an increase as compared with 2,411 kcal/kg for wild-type. As low digestible energy is a major limiting factor in the percent of soybean meal that can be used in poultry diets, these results may substantiate the use of higher concentrations of low-raffinose, full-fat soy in formulated livestock diets.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) 'Forrest' was screened to identify mutants within the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutants were identified to have high levels of <span class="trait">seed,</span> nodule, and leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid <span class="trait">content,</span> and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C.</span> Finally, we report that <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In recent years, the application of natural substances on crops has been intensified in order to increase the <span class="trait">resistance</span> and <span class="trait">yield</span> of the soybean crop. Among these products are included plant biostimulants that may contain algae extracts, amino acids, and plant regulators in their composition. However, there is little information on the isolated effect of each of these constituents. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the application of isolated amino acids on the antioxidant metabolism of the soybean crop. Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with the application of the amino acids glutamate, phenylalanine, cysteine, <span class="trait">glycine</span> in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment, and foliar application at V4 growth stage. Antioxidant metabolism constituents evaluated were superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide <span class="trait">content,</span> proline, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, <span class="trait">resistance</span> enzymes as polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were evaluated. In both experiments, the use of cysteine, only in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and in both <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> and catalase. Also in both experiments, the use of phenylalanine increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> when the application was carried out as foliar application or both in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. In the field experiment, the application of glutamate led to an increase in the activity of the catalase and <span class="gene">PAL</span> enzymes for <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. The use of the set of amino acids was only efficient in foliar application, which led to a greater activity of the enzymes peroxidase, PAL, and polyphenol oxidase. The other enzymes as well as lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide presented different results according to the experiment. Therefore, glutamate, cysteine, phenylalanine, and <span class="trait">glycine</span> can act as signaling amino acids in soybean plants, since small doses are enough to increase the activity of the antioxidant enzymes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Many plants have undergone whole genome duplication (WGD). However, how regulatory networks underlying a particular trait are reshaped in polyploids has not been experimentally investigated. Here we show that the regulatory pathways modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> which involve WRINKLED1 (WRI1), LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), and LEC2 in Arabidopsis, have been modified in the palaeopolyploid soybean. Such modifications include functional reduction of <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a/GmWRI1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to WRI1, complementary non-allelic dosage effects of the <span class="gene">GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to LEC1, pseudogenization of the singleton <span class="gene">GmLEC2</span> relevant to LEC2, and the rise of the LEC2-like function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b,</span> contrasting to its homoeolog <span class="gene">GmABI3a,</span> which maintains the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)-like function in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation and dormancy. The function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b</span> in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil biosynthesis was fulfilled by direct binding to a RY (CATGCA) cis-regulatory element in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> promoter, which was absent in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> promoter, resulting in reduction of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> expression. Nevertheless, the three regulators each exhibited similar intensities of purifying selection to their respective duplicates since these pairs were formed by a WGD event that is proposed to have occurred approximately 13 million years ago (mya), suggesting that the differentiation in spatiotemporal expression between the duplicated genes is more likely to be the outcome of neutral variation in regulatory sequences. This study thus exemplifies the plasticity, dynamics, and novelty of regulatory networks mediated by WGD.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean were characterized phylogenetically as members of a distinct group in the genus Ensifer based on 16S rRNA gene comparisons. They were also verified as a separated group by the concatenated sequence analyses of recA, <span class="gene">atpD</span> and <span class="gene">glnII</span> (with similarities ≤93.9% to the type strains for defined species), and by the average nucleotide identities (ANI) between the whole genome sequence of the representative strain CCBAU 251167T and those of the closely related strains in Ensifer glycinis and Ensifer fredii (90.5% and 90.3%, respectively). Phylogeny of symbiotic genes (nodC and nifH) grouped these two strains together with some soybean-nodulating strains of E. fredii, E. glycinis and Ensifer sojae. Nodulation tests indicated that the representative strain CCBAU 251167T could form root nodules with capability of nitrogen fixing on its host plant and <span class="trait">Glycine</span> soja, Cajanus cajan, Vigna unguiculata, Phaseolus vulgaris and Astragalus membranaceus, and it formed ineffective nodules on Leucaena leucocephala. Strain CCBAU 251167T contained fatty acids 18:1 ω9c, 18:0 iso and 20:0, differing from other related strains. Utilization of l-threonine and d-serine as carbon source, growth at pH 6.0 and intolerance of 1% (w/v) NaCl distinguished strain CCBAU 251167T from other type strains of the related species. The genome size of CCBAU 251167T was 6.2Mbp, comprising 7,581 predicted genes with DNA G+C <span class="trait">content</span> of 59.9mol% and 970 unique genes. Therefore, a novel species, Ensifer shofinae sp. nov., is proposed, with CCBAU 251167T (=ACCC 19939T=LMG 29645T) as type strain.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Seed</span> oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <span class="gene">GmZF351,</span> encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating WRINKLED1, BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2, 3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III, DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1, and OLEOSIN2 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation. The ZF351 haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> soja) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <span class="trait">seed</span> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> expression leads to increased <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content</span> in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.

						Plant organs, such as seeds, are primary sources of food for both humans and animals. <span class="trait">Seed</span> size is one of the major agronomic traits that have been selected in crop plants during their domestication. Legume seeds are a major source of dietary proteins and oils. Here, we report a conserved role for the BIG SEEDS1 (BS1) gene in the control of <span class="trait">seed</span> size and weight in the model legume Medicago truncatula and the grain legume soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max). <span class="gene">BS1</span> encodes a plant-specific transcription regulator and plays a key role in the control of the size of plant organs, including seeds, <span class="trait">seed</span> pods, and leaves, through a regulatory module that targets primary cell proliferation. Importantly, down-regulation of <span class="gene">BS1</span> orthologs in soybean by an artificial microRNA significantly increased soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> size, weight, and amino acid <span class="trait">content.</span> Our results provide a strategy for the increase in <span class="trait">yield</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> quality in legumes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Increasing the production of plant oils such as soybean oil as a renewable resource for food and fuel is valuable. Successful breeding for higher oil levels in soybean, however, usually results in reduced protein, a second valuable <span class="trait">seed</span> component. This study shows that by manipulating a highly active acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) the hydrocarbon flux to oil in oilseeds can be increased without reducing the protein component. Compared to other plant DGATs, a <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from Vernonia galamensis (VgDGAT1A) produces much higher oil synthesis and accumulation activity in yeast, insect cells, and soybean. Soybean lines expressing VgDGAT1A show a 4% increase in oil <span class="trait">content</span> without reductions in <span class="trait">seed</span> protein contents or <span class="trait">yield</span> per unit land area. Incorporation of this trait into 50% of soybeans worldwide could result in an increase of 850 million kg oil/year without new land use or inputs and be worth ∼U.S.$1 billion/year at 2012 production and market prices.

						Kinetically improved diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) variants were created to favorably alter carbon partitioning in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) seeds. Initially, variants of a type 1 <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from a high-oil, high-oleic acid plant <span class="trait">seed,</span> Corylus americana, were screened for high oil <span class="trait">content</span> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nearly all <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants examined from high-oil strains had increased affinity for oleoyl-CoA, with S0.5 values decreased as much as 4.7-fold compared with the wild-type value of 0.94 µm Improved soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants were then designed to include amino acid substitutions observed in promising C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants. The expression of soybean and C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants in soybean somatic embryos resulted in oil contents as high as 10% and 12%, respectively, compared with only 5% and 7.6% oil achieved by overexpressing the corresponding wild-type DGATs. The affinity for oleoyl-CoA correlated strongly with oil <span class="trait">content.</span> The soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variant that gave the greatest oil increase contained 14 amino acid substitutions out of a total of 504 (97% sequence identity with native). Seed-preferred expression of this soybean <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> variant increased oil <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean seeds by an average of 3% (16% relative increase) in highly replicated, single-location field trials. The <span class="gene">DGAT</span> transgenes significantly reduced the soluble carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of mature seeds and increased the <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> of some events. This study demonstrated that engineering of the native <span class="gene">DGAT</span> enzyme is an effective strategy to improve the oil <span class="trait">content</span> and value of soybeans.

						KEY MESSAGE: Identification and characterization of a 254-kb genomic deletion on a duplicated chromosome segment that resulted in a low level of palmitic acid in soybean seeds using transcriptome sequencing. A large number of soybean genotypes varying in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil composition and <span class="trait">content</span> have been identified. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these variations is important for breeders to effectively utilize them as a genetic resource. Through design and application of a bioinformatics approach, we identified nine co-regulated gene clusters by comparing <span class="trait">seed</span> transcriptomes of nine soybean genotypes varying in oil composition and <span class="trait">content.</span> We demonstrated that four gene clusters in the genotypes M23, Jack and N0304-303-3 coincided with large-scale genome rearrangements. The co-regulated gene clusters in M23 and Jack mapped to a previously described 164-kb deletion and a copy number amplification of the <span class="gene">Rhg1</span> locus, respectively. The coordinately down-regulated gene clusters in N0304-303-3 were caused by a 254-kb deletion containing 19 genes including a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B gene (FATB1a). This deletion was associated with reduced palmitic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds and was the molecular cause of a previously reported nonfunctional <span class="gene">FATB1a</span> allele, fap nc . The M23 and N0304-304-3 deletions were located in duplicated genome segments retained from the Glycine-specific whole genome duplication that occurred 13 million years ago. The homoeologous genes in these duplicated regions shared a strong similarity in both their encoded protein sequences and transcript accumulation levels, suggesting that they may have conserved and important functions in seeds. The functional conservation of homoeologous genes may result in genetic redundancy and gene dosage effects for their associated <span class="trait">seed</span> traits, explaining why the large deletion did not cause lethal effects or completely eliminate palmitic acid in N0304-303-3.

						Compared to β-conglycinin, glycinin contains 3-4 times the methionine and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the glycinin and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for glycinin (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of glycinin and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of glycinin. These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.

						Isoflavone reductase (IFR) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of isoflavonoid phytoalexin in plants. IFRs are unique to the plant kingdom and are considered to have crucial roles in plant response to various biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. Here, we report the characterization of a novel member of the soybean isoflavone reductase gene family <span class="gene">GmIFR.</span> Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmIFR</span> transgenic soybean exhibited enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> to Phytophthora sojae. Following stress treatments, <span class="gene">GmIFR</span> was significantly induced by P. sojae, ethephon (ET), abscisic acid (placeCityABA), salicylic acid (SA). It is located in the cytoplasm when transiently expressed in soybean protoplasts. The daidzein levels reduced greatly for the seeds of transgenic plants, while the relative <span class="trait">content</span> of glyceollins in transgenic plants was significantly higher than that of non-transgenic plants. Furthermore, we found that the relative expression levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of transgenic soybean plants were significantly lower than those of non-transgenic plants after incubation with P. sojae, suggesting an important role of <span class="gene">GmIFR</span> might function as an antioxidant to reduce ROS in soybean. The enzyme activity assay suggested that <span class="gene">GmIFR</span> has isoflavone reductase activity.

						Microsomal omega-6 fatty acid desaturase (FAD2-1B) is an enzyme that regulates the polyunsaturated fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybeans <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max). In this study, the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> gene was determined to be highly expressed in soybean seeds using quantitative real-time PCR(qRT-PCR). To investigate the expression pattern and activity of the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> promoter, a 1929 bp 5'-upstream genomic DNA fragment, named PF, was isolated according to the soybean genomic sequence. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of many motifs related to seed-specific promoters in the PF fragment, such as E-box, SEF4, Skn-1 motif, AACACA, AATAAA and so on. Tobacco transgenics carrying the gus reporter gene driven by the PF and/or 35S promoters were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR. qRT-PCR and histochemical GUS assays showed that the PF promoter could regulate gus gene accumulation in seeds and the expression level was higher than in other organs. In the meantime, it exhibited similar activity to the 35S promoter in seeds, which could be associated with seed-related cis-elements found in the 1-248 bp, 451-932 bp, and 1627-1803 bp regions of the promoter.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Hardness of cooked soybeans <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L). Merr.] is an important attribute in food processing. We found one candidate gene, <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> to be associated with the hardness of cotyledons of cooked soybeans, based on a quantitative trait locus and fine-scale mapping analyses using a recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between two Japanese cultivars, "Natto-shoryu" and "Hyoukei-kuro 3". Analysis of the DNA sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360,</span> a pectin methylesterase gene homologue, revealed three patterns of mutations, two of which result in truncated proteins and one of which results in an amino acid substitution. The truncated proteins are presumed to lack the enzymatic activity of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> We classified 24 cultivars into four groups based on the sequence of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360.</span> The texture analysis using the 22 cultivars grown in different locations indicated that protein truncation of <span class="gene">Glyma03g03360</span> resulted in softer cotyledons of cooked soybeans, which was further confirmed by texture analysis performed using F2 populations of a cross between "Enrei" and "LD00-3309", and between "Satonohohoemi" and "Sakukei 98". A positive correlation between hardness and calcium <span class="trait">content</span> implies the possible effect of calcium binding to pectins on the hardness of cooked soybean cotyledons.

						BACKGROUND: SWEET (MtN3_saliva) domain proteins, a recently identified group of efflux transporters, play an indispensable role in sugar efflux, phloem loading, plant-pathogen interaction and reproductive tissue development. The SWEET gene family is predominantly studied in Arabidopsis and members of the family are being investigated in rice. To date, no transcriptome or genomics analysis of soybean SWEET genes has been reported. RESULTS: In the present investigation, we explored the evolutionary aspect of the SWEET gene family in diverse plant species including primitive single cell algae to angiosperms with a major emphasis on <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max. Evolutionary features showed expansion and duplication of the SWEET gene family in land plants. Homology searches with BLAST tools and Hidden Markov Model-directed sequence alignments identified 52 SWEET genes that were mapped to 15 chromosomes in the soybean genome as tandem duplication events. Soybean SWEET <span class="gene">(GmSWEET)</span> genes showed a wide range of expression profiles in different tissues and developmental stages. Analysis of public transcriptome data and expression profiling using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that a majority of the <span class="gene">GmSWEET</span> genes were confined to reproductive tissue development. Several natural genetic variants (non-synonymous SNPs, premature stop codons and haplotype) were identified in the <span class="gene">GmSWEET</span> genes using whole genome re-sequencing data analysis of 106 soybean genotypes. A significant association was observed between SNP-haplogroup and <span class="trait">seed</span> sucrose <span class="trait">content</span> in three gene clusters on chromosome 6. CONCLUSION: Present investigation utilized comparative genomics, transcriptome profiling and whole genome re-sequencing approaches and provided a systematic description of soybean SWEET genes and identified putative candidates with probable roles in the reproductive tissue development. Gene expression profiling at different developmental stages and genomic variation data will aid as an important resource for the soybean research community and can be extremely valuable for understanding sink unloading and enhancing carbohydrate delivery to developing seeds for improving <span class="trait">yield.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.) oil typically contains 8% α-linolenic acid that is highly unstable and easily oxidized. This property is undesirable in many food and industrial applications. Genetic strategies for reducing α-linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> would enhance the commercial value. However, genetic resources for low α-linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> are limited among natural soybean variations. Microsomal omega-3-fatty acid desaturase (FAD3) is responsible for the synthesis of α-linolenic acid in the polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway. There are four <span class="gene">FAD3</span> homologs <span class="gene">(Glyma02g39230,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma11g27190,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma14g37350</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma18g06950)</span> in the soybean genome. While non-functional alleles have been reported for <span class="gene">Glyma02g39230</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1a)</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma14g37350</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1b),</span> little variation is seen in <span class="gene">Glyma18g06950</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-2a).</span> We isolated seven mutant <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a</span> alleles, each containing a single-nucleotide substitution, from 39,100 independent mutant lines by using targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING). Analysis of <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a</span> transcripts and enzyme activities revealed that one missense mutant, 'P1-A9', contains a non-functional allele of <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a.</span> By combining three non-functional alleles <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1a,</span> <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1b,</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a),</span> we generated soybean lines containing &lt;2% α-linolenic acid in their seeds. The reverse-genetics-based development of novel mutant alleles in the fatty acid metabolic pathway will allow the improvement of soybean with better oil quality through conventional breeding.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy protein is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the acidic (A) polypeptides of glycinin, basic (B) polypeptides of glycinin, and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in glycinin (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of glycinin and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in glycinin subunit, and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in glycinin subunit when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in glycinin subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soya bean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) plants overexpressing a seed-specific bacterial phytoene synthase gene from Pantoea ananatis modified to target to plastids accumulated 845 μg β carotene g(-1) dry <span class="trait">seed</span> weight with a desirable 12:1 ratio of β to α. The β carotene accumulating seeds exhibited a shift in oil composition increasing oleic acid with a concomitant decrease in linoleic acid and an increase in <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> by at least 4% (w/w). Elevated β-carotene accumulating soya bean cotyledons contain 40% the amount of abscisic acid compared to nontransgenic cotyledons. Proteomic and nontargeted metabolomic analysis of the mid-maturation β-carotene cotyledons compared to the nontransgenic did not reveal any significant differences that would account for the altered phenotypes of both elevated oleate and protein <span class="trait">content.</span> Transcriptomic analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR, revealed a number of significant differences in ABA-responsive transcripton factor gene expression in the <span class="gene">crtB</span> transgenics compared to nontransgenic cotyledons of the same maturation stage. The altered <span class="trait">seed</span> composition traits seem to be attributed to altered ABA hormone levels varying transcription factor expression. The elevated β-carotene, oleic acid and protein traits in the β-carotene soya beans confer a substantial additive nutritional quality to soya beans.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) seeds are the primary source of edible oil in the United States. Despite its widespread utility, soybean oil is oxidatively unstable. Until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent chemical hydrogenation, a process which also generates trans fats. An alternative to chemical hydrogenation is genetic modification of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil through identification and introgression of mutant alleles. One target for improvement is the elevation of a saturated fat with no negative cardiovascular impacts, stearic acid, which typically constitutes a minute portion of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil (~3%). RESULTS: We examined radiation induced soybean mutants with moderately increased stearic acid (10-15% of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil, ~3-5 X the levels in wild-type soybean seeds) via comparative whole genome hybridization and genetic analysis. The deletion of one <span class="gene">SACPD</span> isoform encoding gene (SACPD-C) was perfectly correlated with moderate elevation of <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> However, <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion lines were also found to have altered nodule fatty acid composition and grossly altered morphology. Despite these defects, overall nodule accumulation and nitrogen fixation were unaffected, at least under laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Although no <span class="trait">yield</span> penalty has been reported for moderate elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds, our results demonstrate that genetic alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> traits can have unforeseen pleiotropic consequences. We have identified a role for fatty acid biosynthesis, and <span class="gene">SACPD</span> activity in particular, in the establishment and maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, soy proteins were reduced with 0.1-10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to obtain an increasing number of sulphydryl groups (SH) with a similar particle size. Aggregation was promoted by increasing the degree of reduction when heated (100°C, 30min), resulting in larger sized aggregates (from 40 to 70nm) and a higher viscosity of the aggregate dispersion. The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of acidic (A) polypeptide of glycinin, basic (B) polypeptides of glycinin, and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation. The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of glycinin and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on protein aggregates formation.

						KEY MESSAGE: Two new sources of elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> stearic acid were identified and the feasibility of an elevated stearic acid, high oleic acid germplasm was studied. Soybean <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.] oil typically contains 2-4% stearic acid. Oil with at least 20% stearic acid is desirable because of its improved baking properties and health profile. This study identifies two new sources of high stearic acid and evaluates the interaction of high stearic and oleic acid alleles. TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755, high stearic acid 'Holladay' mutants, were crossed to FAM94-41-3, a line containing a point mutation in a seed-specific isoform of a Δ9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (SACPD-C). F2-derived lines were evaluated for fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in four field environments. Sequencing of SACPDs in TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755 revealed distinct deletions of at least one megabase encompassing <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> in both lines. After genotyping, the additive effect for stearic acid was estimated at +1.8% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> point mutation and +4.1% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletions. Average stearic acid in lines homozygous for the deletions was 12.2%. A FAM94-41-3-derived line and TCHM08-1087-11, a selection from TCHM08-1087, were crossed to S09-2902-145, a line containing missense mutations in two fatty acid desaturases (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). F1 plants were grown in a greenhouse and individual F2 <span class="trait">seed</span> were genotyped and phenotyped. No interaction was observed between either <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> or <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> and any of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutant alleles. <span class="trait">Seed</span> homozygous mutant for SACPD-C/FAD2-1A/FAD2-1B contained 12.7% stearic acid and 65.5% oleic acid while <span class="trait">seed</span> homozygous for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion and mutant for <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> averaged 10.4% stearic acid and 75.9% oleic acid.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The reaction catalyzed by squalene synthase (EC.2.5.1.21) that converts two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene represents a crucial branch point of the isoprenoid pathway in diverting carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of sterols. In the present study two soybean squalene synthase genes, <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> and <span class="gene">GmSQS2,</span> were identified in the soybean genome and functionally characterized for their roles in sterol biosynthesis. Both genes encode a deduced protein of 413 amino acids. Complementation assays showed that the two genes were able to convert yeast sterol auxotrophy erg9 mutant to sterol prototrophy. Expression of <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> and <span class="gene">GmSQS2</span> was ubiquitous in roots, stem, leaves, flower and young seeds of soybean, however <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> transcript was preferential in roots while <span class="gene">GmSQS2</span> transcript was more in leaves. Their expression was lower in response to dehydration treatments suggesting they might be negative regulators of water stress adaptation. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> driven by either constitutive or seed-specific promoters showed increases in the major end product sterols: campesterol, sitosterol and stigmasterol, which resulted in up to 50% increase in total sterol <span class="trait">content</span> in the seeds. The increase in the end product sterols by <span class="gene">GmSQS1</span> overexpression was at the level achievable by previously reported overexpression of individual or combination of other key enzymes in the sterol pathway. Together the data demonstrate that soybean SQS genes play an important role in diverting carbon flux to the biosynthesis of the end product sterols in the seeds.

						We analyzed the molecular mechanism controlling ω-3 fatty acid desaturases during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and leaf development in soybean. During germination, soybean seeds were characterized by a high 18:2(Δ9,12) level (more than 50%) and reduced 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> (10%). Interestingly, transcripts from all endoplasmic reticulum <span class="gene">(GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B)</span> and plastidial <span class="gene">(GmFAD7-1/GmFAD7-2</span> or <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1/GmFAD8-2)</span> desaturase genes were detected during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination. Upon germination, soybean trifoliate leaf development was accompanied by an increase in linolenic acid (18:3(Δ9,12,15)). Our data showed that transcripts corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B</span> decreased with leaf development. No changes in the expression profile of the plastidial ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD7-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD7-2</span> genes were detected. On the contrary, <span class="gene">GmFAD8-2</span> transcript levels increased while <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> transcripts decreased during leaf development. Given this expression profile, our data suggested the existence of a temporal regulatory mechanism controlling ω-3 desaturases during leaf development in which the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases would be more important in young leaves while plastidial ω-3 desaturases might contribute to 18:3(Δ9,12,15) production in mature leaves. Photosynthetic cell cultures showed 18:3(Δ9,12,15) levels similar to those from leaves. No changes in the 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> or expression of the ω-3 desaturase genes were detected along the cell culture cycle. A comparison of our data with those available in Arabidopsis or wheat suggested that the regulatory mechanism controlling the expression and activity of both endoplasmic reticulum and plastidial desaturases during leaf development might differ among plant species.

						Cinnamic acid is a known allelochemical that affects <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and plant root growth and therefore influences several metabolic processes. In the present work, we evaluated its effects on growth, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) oxidase and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) activities and lignin monomer composition in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) roots. The results revealed that exogenously applied cinnamic acid inhibited root growth and increased IAA oxidase and <span class="gene">C4H</span> activities. The allelochemical increased the total lignin <span class="trait">content,</span> thus altering the sum and ratios of the p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) lignin monomers. When applied alone or with cinnamic acid, piperonylic acid (PIP, a quasi-irreversible inhibitor of C4H) reduced <span class="gene">C4H</span> activity, lignin and the H, G, S monomer <span class="trait">content</span> compared to the cinnamic acid treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that exogenously applied cinnamic acid can be channeled into the phenylpropanoid pathway via the <span class="gene">C4H</span> reaction, resulting in an increase in H lignin. In conjunction with enhanced IAA oxidase activity, these metabolic responses lead to the stiffening of the cell wall and are followed by a reduction in soybean root growth.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low phosphorus (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved P efficiency in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and P <span class="trait">content,</span> respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P efficiency could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds accumulate large amounts of isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and glycitein), secondary metabolites known for their phytoestrogenic activities. Isoflavone composition depends on the <span class="trait">seed</span> part and glycitein is almost found exclusively in hypocotyls. Moreover, two major phenotypes are encountered in soybean cultivars, with either low (35 %) or high (55 %) levels of glycitein in their hypocotyls. This trait was under a quasi-mendelian heredity, implicating at most one or two genes. A <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> cDNA displaying a flavonoid 6-hydroxylase (F6H) activity had previously been isolated from elicitor-induced soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max L.) cells. This enzyme allows the synthesis of the glycitein flavanone intermediate (6,7,4'- trihydroxyflavanone) by catalyzing the A-ring hydroxylation of liquiritigenin. In this study, the <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> gene (F6H1) and two other candidates (F6H2 and F6H3) were studied using contrasted soybean cultivars for glycitein <span class="trait">content</span> (0, 35, 55 and 80 %). Their expression was observed in chitosan elicited leaves. They encode <span class="gene">P450</span> proteins of 496, 469 and 481 amino acids respectively and were expressed in leaves with or without elicitation. The expression patterns of these three genes were performed in cotyledons and hypocotyls at different developmental stages. <span class="gene">F6H1</span> and <span class="gene">F6H2</span> were not expressed in the developing <span class="trait">seed.</span> <span class="gene">F6H3</span> was only expressed in hypocotyls. Its expression levels did not correlate with hypocotyls glycitein <span class="trait">content,</span> but it was not expressed in the null mutant for glycitein. Thus, this <span class="gene">F6H3</span> gene is a good potential candidate for glycitein biosynthesis in soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Palmitic acid is the most abundant (approx. 11% of total fatty acids) saturated fatty acid in conventional soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> oil. Increasing the saturated acid <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean oil improves its oxidative stability and plasticity. We have developed three soybean mutants with high palmitic acid <span class="trait">content</span> by X-ray irradiation. In this study, we successfully identified the mutated sites of two of these high-palmitic-acid mutants, J10 and M22. PCR-based mutant analysis revealed that J10 has a 206,203-bp-long deletion that includes the <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> gene and 16 other predicted genes, and M22 has a 26-bp-long deletion in the sixth intron of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB.</span> The small deletion in M22 causes mis-splicing of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> transcripts, which should result in nonfunctional products. In addition, we designed co-dominant marker sets for these mutant alleles and confirmed the association of genotypes and palmitic acid contents in F(2) seeds of J10 X M22. This information will be useful in breeding programs to develop novel soybean cultivars with improved palmitic acid <span class="trait">content.</span> However, in the third mutant, KK7, we found no polymorphism in either <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> or <span class="gene">GmKASIIB,</span> which suggests that several unknown genes in addition to <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> and <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> may be involved in elevating the palmitic acid <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> oil.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max L. [Merr]) plants export nitrogen from the nodules as ureides during symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation. Ureides also play a role as nitrogen storage compounds in the seeds and are broken down in germinating seedlings. In this work we identified four soybean genes encoding allantoinase (E.C. 3.5.2.5), an enzyme involved in both ureide production in nodules and ureide catabolism in leaves and other sink tissues. We examined ureide <span class="trait">content,</span> allantoinase enzyme activity and expression of these genes, which we term <span class="gene">GmALN1</span> through <span class="gene">GmALN4,</span> in germinating seedlings and in vegetative tissues from 45 day old soybean plants. <span class="gene">GmALN1</span> and <span class="gene">GmALN2</span> transcripts were measured in all tissues, but similar levels of expression of <span class="gene">GmALN3</span> and <span class="gene">GmALN4</span> was only observed in nodules. The soybean allantoinase genes seem to have arisen through tandem gene duplication followed by a whole genome duplication. We looked for evidence of the tandem duplication in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and present evidence that it occured sometime in the bean lineage before these two species diverged, but before soybean became a tetraploid.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Urea is the nitrogen fertilizer most utilized in crop production worldwide. Understanding all factors involved in urea metabolism in plants is an essential step towards assessing and possibly improving the use of urea by plants. Urease, the enzyme responsible for urea hydrolysis, and its accessory proteins, necessary for nickel incorporation into the enzyme active site and concomitant activation, have been extensively characterized in bacteria. In contrast, little is known about their plant counterparts. This work reports a detailed characterization of <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max UreG <span class="gene">(GmUreG),</span> a urease accessory protein. Two forms of native <span class="gene">GmUreG,</span> purified from seeds, were separated by metal affinity chromatography, and their properties (GTPase activity in absence and presence of Ni(2+) or Zn(2+), secondary structure and metal <span class="trait">content)</span> were compared with the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. The binding affinity of recombinant <span class="gene">GmUreG</span> (rGmUreG) for Ni(2+) and Zn(2+) was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. rGmUreG binds Zn(2+) or Ni(2+) differently, presenting a very tight binding site for Zn(2+) (K (d) = 0.02 ± 0.01 μM) but not for Ni(2+), thus suggesting that Zn(2+) may play a role on the plant urease assembly process, as suggested for bacteria. Size exclusion chromatography showed that Zn(2+) stabilizes a dimeric form of the rGmUreG, while NMR measurements indicate that rGmUreG belongs to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins. A homology model for the fully folded <span class="gene">GmUreG</span> was built and compared to bacterial UreG models, and the possible sites of interaction with other accessory proteins were investigated.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max (L.) Merrill) is a salt-sensitive crop, and its production is severely affected by saline soils. Therefore, the response of soybean seeds to salt stress during germination was investigated at both physiological and proteomic levels. The salt-tolerant cultivar Lee68 and salt-sensitive cultivar N2899 were exposed to 100 mmol/L NaCl until radicle protrusion from the <span class="trait">seed</span> coat. In both cultivars, the final germination percentage was not affected by salt, but the mean germination times of Lee68 and N2899 were delayed by 0.3 and 1.0 d, respectively, compared with controls. In response to salt stress, the abscisic acid <span class="trait">content</span> increased, and gibberellic acid (GA₁+₃) and isopentenyladenosine decreased. Indole-3-acetic acid increased in Lee68, but remained unchanged in N2899. The proteins extracted from germinated seeds were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), followed by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 staining. About 350 protein spots from 2-DE gels of pH range 3 to 10 and 650 spots from gels of pH range 4 to 7 were reproducibly resolved, of which 18 protein spots showed changes in abundance as a result of salt stress in both cultivars. After matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis of the differentially expressed proteins, the peptide mass fingerprint was searched against the soybean UniGene database and nine proteins were successfully identified. Ferritin and 20S proteasome subunit β-6 were up-regulated in both cultivars. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase (GST) 9, <span class="gene">GST</span> 10, and <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation protein PM36 were down-regulated in Lee68 by salt, but still remained at a certain level. However, these proteins were present in lower levels in control N2899 and were up-regulated under salt stress. The results indicate that these proteins might have important roles in defense mechanisms against salt stress during soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> germination.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean seeds contain substantial amount of diverse triterpenoid saponins that influence the <span class="trait">seed</span> quality, although little is known about the physiologic functions of saponins in plants. We now describe the modification of saponin biosynthesis by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing targeted to β-amyrin synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of a common aglycon of soybean saponins. We identified two putative β-amyrin synthase genes in soybean that manifested distinct expression patterns with regard to developmental stage and tissue specificity. Given that one of these genes, <span class="gene">GmBAS1,</span> was expressed at a much higher level than the other <span class="gene">(GmBAS2)</span> in various tissues including the developing seeds, we constructed two RNAi vectors that encode self-complementary hairpin RNAs corresponding to the distinct regions of <span class="gene">GmBAS1</span> under the control of a seed-specific promoter derived from the soybean gene for the α' subunit of the <span class="trait">seed</span> storage protein β-conglycinin. These vectors were introduced independently into soybean. Six independent transgenic lines exhibited a stable reduction in <span class="trait">seed</span> saponin <span class="trait">content,</span> with the extent of saponin deficiency correlating with the β-amyrin synthase mRNA depletion. Although some transgenic lines produced seeds almost devoid of saponins, no abnormality in their growth was apparent and the antioxidant activity of their seeds was similar to that of control seeds. These results suggest that saponins are not required for <span class="trait">seed</span> development and survival, and that soybean seeds may therefore be amenable to the modification of triterpenoid saponin <span class="trait">content</span> and composition through molecular biologic approaches.

						Experiments were conducted to investigate the role of a newly isolated endophytic fungus <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> on physiology of host plant <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max. L cv. Hwangkeum-kong) growing under salinity stress. <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> was identified as a new strain of Penicillium funiculosum on the basis of sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis of D1/D2 regions of 28S rDNA. Preliminary screening experiment showed that the culture filtrate (CF) of <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> promoted the growth of Waito-C, a dwarf gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis mutant rice cultivar. Analysis of fungal CF revealed the presence of GAs (GA₁ 1.53 ng/ml; GA₄ 9.34 ng/ml; GA₈ 1.21 ng/ml; GA₉ 37.87 ng/ml) and indole acetic acid (14.85 μg/ml). <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> also showed high phosphate solubilization of tricalcium phosphate. Besides that, <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> application enhanced soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> germination as compared to control. Under salinity stress (70 and 140 mM), <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> significantly promoted the soybean growth attributes (shoot length, shoot fresh/dry biomass, chlorophyll <span class="trait">content,</span> photosynthesis rate and leaf area) in comparison to control treatments. We also observed low endogenous abscisic acid and elevated jasmonic acid contents in <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> treated plants under salt stress. <span class="gene">GMC-2A</span> treatment significantly enhanced levels of isoflavones (34.22% and 75.37%) under salinity stress as compared to control. In conclusion, P. funiculosum LHL06 has significantly ameliorated the adverse effects of salinity induced abiotic stress, and re-programmed soybean to higher growth and isoflavone biosynthesis.

						Linolenic acid (LN) in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max L. Merr.) <span class="trait">seed</span> mainly contributes to the undesirable odors and flavors commonly associated with poor oil quality. LN deposition at various stages of soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> development had not been reported by 2010. The objects of this study were (1) to identify and measure quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying LN <span class="trait">content</span> and (2) to estimate the QTL effects expressed from earlier <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages to drying <span class="trait">seed</span> of soybean. One hundred and twenty-five F(5:8) and F(5:9) recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of soybean cultivars 'Hefeng 25' and 'Dongnong L5' were used for the identification of QTL underlying LN <span class="trait">content</span> from the 37 day (D) to 86D stages after flowering, at Harbin in 2008 and 2009. QTL × Environment interactions (QE) effects were evaluated using a mixed genetic model (Zhu in J Zhejiang Univ (Natural Science) 33:327-335, 1999). Twelve unconditional QTL and 12 conditional QTL associated with LN <span class="trait">content</span> were identified at different developmental stages. Most of the QTL explained &lt;10% of phenotypic variation of LN <span class="trait">content.</span> Unconditional QTL QLNF-1, QLNC2-1, QLND1b-1, QLNA2-1 and QLNH-1 influenced LN <span class="trait">content</span> across different development stages and environments. Conditional QTL QLNF-1, QLNC2-1 and QLNH-1 were identified in multiple developmental stages and environments. Conditional and unconditional QTL clustered in neighboring intervals on linkage groups A2, <span class="gene">C2</span> and D1b. Ten QTL with conditional additive main effects (a) and/or conditional additive × environment interaction effects (ae) at specific developmental stage were identified on nine linkage groups. Of them, six QTL only possessed additive main effects and seven QTL had significant ae effects in different developmental stages. A total of 13 epistatic pairwise QTL were identified by conditional mapping in different developmental stages. Two pairs of QTL only showed aa effects and five pairs of QTL only showed aae effects at different developmental stages. QTL with aa effects, as well as their environmental interaction effects, appeared to vary at different developmental stages.

						Mutagenized populations have become indispensable resources for introducing variation and studying gene function in plant genomics research. In this study, fast neutron (FN) radiation was used to induce deletion mutations in the soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) genome. Approximately 120,000 soybean seeds were exposed to FN radiation doses of up to 32 Gray units to develop over 23,000 independent M2 lines. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this population for phenotypic screening and associated genomic characterization of striking and agronomically important traits. Plant variation was cataloged for <span class="trait">seed</span> composition, maturity, morphology, pigmentation, and nodulation traits. Mutants that showed significant increases or decreases in <span class="trait">seed</span> protein and oil <span class="trait">content</span> across multiple generations and environments were identified. The application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to lesion-induced mutants for deletion mapping was validated on a midoleate x-ray mutant, M23, with a known <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> (for fatty acid desaturase) gene deletion. Using CGH, a subset of mutants was characterized, revealing deletion regions and candidate genes associated with phenotypes of interest. Exome resequencing and sequencing of PCR products confirmed FN-induced deletions detected by CGH. Beyond characterization of soybean FN mutants, this study demonstrates the utility of CGH, exome sequence capture, and next-generation sequencing approaches for analyses of mutant plant genomes. We present this FN mutant soybean population as a valuable public resource for future genetic screens and functional genomics research.

						Numerous environmental factors influence isoflavone accumulation and have long hampered their genetic dissection. Temperature and water regimes are two of the most significant abiotic factors. However, while the effects of temperature have been widely studied, little is known about how water scarcity might affect isoflavone concentration in seeds. Studies have shown that accumulation of isoflavones is promoted by well-watered conditions, but the molecular basis remains elusive. The length and severity of the water stress required to induce changes are also still unknown. In the present work, several intensities of water stress were evaluated at various critical stages for soybean <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">seed</span> development, in both field and controlled environments. The results suggested that only long-term progressive <span class="trait">drought,</span> spanning most of the <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages, significantly decreased isoflavone <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds. The reduction is proportional to the intensity of the stress and appears to occur in a genotype-dependent manner. However, regardless of water regime, isoflavone compounds were mainly accumulated in the later <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages. Transcripts of the most important genes for isoflavone biosynthesis were also quantified from samples collected at key <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages under well-watered and long-term water deficit conditions. Expression of CHS7, CHS8 and <span class="gene">IFS2</span> correlated with isoflavone accumulation under well-watered conditions. Interestingly, we found that the two isoflavone synthase genes in soybean (IFS1 and IFS2) showed different patterns of expression. The abundance of <span class="gene">IFS1</span> transcripts was maintained at a constant rate, whereas <span class="gene">IFS2</span> was down-regulated and highly correlated with isoflavone accumulation under both water deficit and well-watered conditions, suggesting <span class="gene">IFS2</span> as a main contributor to isoflavone diminution under <span class="trait">drought.</span>

						Chilling tolerance is an important trait of soybeans <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.] produced in cool climates. We previously isolated a soybean flavonoid 3' hydroxylase (F3'H) gene corresponding to the T locus, which controls pubescence and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat color. A genetic link between the T gene and chilling tolerance has been reported, although the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using the soybean near-isogenic lines (NILs) To7B (TT) and To7G (tt), we examined the relationship between chilling injury, antioxidant activity and flavonoid profiles associated with chilling treatment (15°C). Chilling injury was more severe in the second trifoliate leaves of To7G than in those of To7B. Hydrogen peroxide accumulation and lipid peroxidation were enhanced by chilling in To7G. Chilling-induced enhancement of antioxidant activity was more prominent in To7B than in To7G. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the contents of quercetin glycosides and isorhamnetin glycosides (3',4'-dihydroxylated flavonol derivatives) increase in the second trifoliate leaves of To7B after chilling treatment, whereas the same treatment increased kaempferol glycoside (4'-monohydroxylated flavonol derivatives) <span class="trait">content</span> in the corresponding leaves of To7G. Histochemical staining also demonstrated chilling-induced flavonoid accumulation. Microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the transcript levels of soybean <span class="gene">F3'H</span> are upregulated by chilling. The differences in chilling injury, antioxidant activity and flavonoid species between the two NILs support the notion that soybean <span class="gene">F3'H</span> affects chilling tolerance by increasing antioxidant activity via production of 3',4'-dihydroxylated flavonol derivatives.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sterol 24C-methyltransferases (SMTs) constitute a group of sequence-related proteins that catalyze the distinct patterns of 24-alkyl sterols that occur throughout nature. Two SMT cDNAs (SMT2-1 and SMT2-2) were cloned by homology based PCR methods from young leaves of <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max (soybean) and the corresponding enzymes were expressed functionally in Escherichia coli. The full-length cDNA for <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> have open reading frames of 1086 bp and 1092 bp, respectively, and encode proteins of 361 and 363 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 40.3 and 40.4 kDa, respectively. The substrate preference of the two isoforms was similar yet they differed from SMT1; kinetically <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> generated k(cat) values for the optimal substrate 24(28)methylene lophenol of 0.8 min(-1) and 1.34 min(-1), respectively, compared to the activity of SMT1 that generated a k(cat) for the optimal substrate cycloartenol of 0.6 min(-1). <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> was purified to homogeneity and the subunit organization shown to be tetrameric in similar fashion to other cloned SMTs. Analysis of the accumulated products catalyzed by the recombinant enzymes demonstrated that soybean <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> and <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> operate transalkylation activities analogous to the soybean plant SMT1. Metabolite analyses correlated with transcript profiling of the three SMT isoforms during soybean maturation clearly demonstrated that SMT isoform expression determines specific C24-methyl to C24-ethyl ratios to flowering whereas with <span class="trait">seed</span> development there is a disconnection such that the SMT transcript levels decrease against an increase in sterol <span class="trait">content;</span> generally <span class="gene">SMT2-2</span> is expressed more than <span class="gene">SMT2-1</span> or SMT1. These observations suggest that the genes that encode SMT1 and SMT2 in sitosterol biosynthesis may have undergone divergent evolution. In support of this proposition, the genomic organization for SMT1 of fungi and protozoa align very closely with one another and to those of the plant SMT2; both sets of SMTs lack introns. Unexpectedly, the SMT1 from <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max and other embryophytes of diverse origin possess disparate intron-exon characteristics that can be shown relates back to the algae. Our results suggest that the order of SMT1 appearing before SMT2 in phytosterol synthesis arose recently in plant evolution in response to duplication of a more primitive SMT gene likely to have been bifunctional and catalytically promiscuous.

Two <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> QTLs were detected under both well-watered and drought-stressed conditions in the field on molecular linkage group H and D1b, while two <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> QTLs on molecular linkage group <span class="gene">C2</span> were found under greenhouse conditions. Several QTLs for traits associated with plant water status were identified in both field and greenhouse trials, including two leaf wilting coefficient QTLs on molecular linkage group A2 and one excised leaf water loss QTL on molecular linkage group H. Phenotypic correlations of traits suggested several QTLs had pleiotropic or location-linked associations. These results will help to elucidate the genetic basis of <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance in soybean, and could be incorporated into a marker-assisted selection breeding program to develop high-yielding soybean cultivars with improved tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress.

						Reduction of phytic acid in soybean seeds has the potential to improve the nutritional value of soybean meal and lessen phosphorus pollution in large scale animal farming. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of two new low phytic acid (LPA) mutations on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits. Multilocation/season comparative analyses showed that the two mutations did not affect the concentration of crude protein, any of the individual amino acids, crude oil, and individual saturated fatty acids. Among other traits, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW75-1</span> had consistently higher sucrose contents (+47.4-86.1%) and lower raffinose contents (-74.2 to -84.3%) than those of wild type (WT) parent Taiwan 75; <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had higher total isoflavone contents (3038.8-4305.4 microg/g) than its parent Zhechun # 3 (1583.6-2644.9 microg/g) in all environments. Further tests of homozygous F(3) progenies of the cross <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> x Wuxing # 4 (WT variety) showed that LPA lines had a mean <span class="trait">content</span> of total isoflavone significantly higher than WT lines. This study demonstrated that two LPA mutant genes have no negative effects on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits; they instead have the potential to improve a few other properties. Therefore, these two mutant genes are valuable genetic resources for breeding high quality soybean varieties.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is important to the nutritional quality of soybean meal. Organic phosphorus (P) in PA is indigestible in humans and non-ruminant animals, which affects nutrition and causes P pollution of ground water from animal wastes. Two novel soybean <span class="trait">[(Glycine</span> max L. (Merr.)] low phytic acid (lpa) mutations were isolated and characterized. <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a phytic acid P (PA-P) reduction of 66.6% and a sixfold increase in inorganic P (Pi), and <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had a PA-P reduction of 46.3% and a 1.4-fold increase in Pi, compared with their respective non-mutant progenitor lines. The reduction of PA-P and increase of Pi in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> were molar equivalent; the decrease of PA-P in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> however, was accompanied by the increase of both Pi and lower inositol phosphates. In both mutant lines, the total P <span class="trait">content</span> remained similar to their wild type parents. The two lpa mutations were both inherited in a single recessive gene model but were non-allelic. Sequence data and progeny analysis indicate that <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> lpa mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in the soybean D: -myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1 EC 5.5.1.4) gene 1 (MIPS1). The lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was mapped on LG B2, closely linked with microsatellite loci Satt416 and Satt168, at genetic distances of approximately 4.63 and approximately 9.25 cM, respectively. Thus this mutation probably represents a novel soybean lpa locus. The <span class="trait">seed</span> emergence rate of <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was similar to its progenitor line and was not affected by <span class="trait">seed</span> source and its lpa mutation. However, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a significantly reduced field emergence when seeds were produced in a subtropic environment. Field tests of the mutants and their progenies further demonstrated that the lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> does not negatively affect plant <span class="trait">yield</span> traits. These results will advance understanding of the genetic, biochemical and molecular control of PA synthesis in soybean. The novel lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> together with linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, will be of value for breeding productive lpa soybeans, with meal high in digestible Pi eventually to improve animal nutrition and lessen environmental pollution.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We have used cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression during embryo development in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) and to compare gene expression profiles of two soybean cultivars that differ in <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid <span class="trait">content.</span> The analysis identified 5,910 genes that were differentially expressed in both soybean cultivars grown at two different locations for two consecutive years in one of the five different stages of embryo development. An ANOVA analysis with P value &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01 indicated that gene expression changes due to environmental factors are greater than those due to cultivar differences. Most changes in gene expression occurred at the stages when the embryos were at 30 or 70 d after pollination. A significantly larger fraction of genes (48.5%) was expressed throughout the development and showed little or no change in expression. Transcript accumulation for genes related to the biosynthesis of storage components in soybean embryos showed several unique temporal expressions. Expression patterns of several genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis, such as Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase, Chalcone Synthase (CHS) 7, CHS8, and Isoflavone Synthase2, were higher at 70 d after pollination in both the cultivars. Thus, expression of these genes coincides with the onset of accumulation of isoflavonoids in the embryos. A comparative analysis of genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in RCAT Angora (high <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) and Harovinton (low <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) revealed that <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 were expressed at significantly greater level in RCAT Angora than in Harovinton. Our study provides a detailed transcriptome profiling of soybean embryos during development and indicates that differences in the level of <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoids between these two cultivars could be as a result of differential expression of <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 during late stages of <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

						Alpha-linolenic acid(ALA, C18:3delta9,12,15 ) is an essential fatty acid which has many sanitary functions to human. However, its contents in diets are often not enough. In plants, omega-3 fatty acid desaturases(FAD) catalyze linoleic acid(LA, C18:2delta9,12) into ALA. The <span class="trait">seed</span> oil of <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max contains high level of ALA. To investigate the functions of <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max omega-3FAD, the cDNA of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C was amplified by RT-PCR from immature seeds, then cloned into the shuttle expression vector p416 to generate the recombinant vector p4GFAD3C. The resulting vector was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae K601 throuth LiAc method. The positive clones were screened on the CM(Ura-) medium and identified by PCR, and then cultured in CM (Ura-) liquid medium with exogenous LA in 20 degrees C for three days. The intracellular fatty acid composition of the engineering strain Kp416 and Kp4GFAD3C was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A novel peak in strain Kp4GFAD3C was detected,which was not detectable in control, Comparison of the retention times of the newly yielded peak with that of authentic standard indicated that the fatty acid is ALA. The <span class="trait">content</span> of ALA reached to 3.1% of the total fatty acid in recombinant strain, the <span class="trait">content</span> of LA correspondingly decreased from 22% to 16.2% by contrast. It was suggested that the protein encoded by <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C can specifically catalyze 18 carbon PUFA substrate of LA into ALA by taking off hydrogen atoms at delta15 location. In this study, we expressed a <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene in S. cerevisiae; An efficient and economical yeast expressing system(K601-p416 system) which is suitable for the expression of FAD was built.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate <span class="gene">(GmMIPS1)</span> gene. We have observed an absence of <span class="trait">seed</span> development in lines in which the presence of <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic reduction of phytate (InsP6) <span class="trait">content</span> was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> gene expression and <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

Plants from four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for transgene integration and <span class="trait">seed</span> IP6 levels. The reduction in IP6 levels in transgenic seeds compared to control 'Jack' soybeans ranged from 12.6 to 24.8 as determined by HPLC. A low copy transformant was propagated to the T4 generation and examined in more detail for phytase expression and enzyme activity during <span class="trait">seed</span> development. Expression of phytase mRNA and phytase activity increased during <span class="trait">seed</span> development, consistent with the use of an embryo-specific promoter.

						Four storage conditions including adverse conditions [84% relative humidity (RH), 30 degrees C], mild conditions (57% RH, 20 degrees C), cold conditions (4 degrees C), and uncontrolled ambient conditions were used for storing soybeans. The storage time was 9 months for the adverse conditions and 18 months for the other three conditions. Beta-conglycinin was purified and characterized with respect to its molecular properties. After storage under the adverse conditions, beta-conglycinin showed no significant changes in total sugar <span class="trait">content,</span> surface hydrophobicity, free SH and <span class="gene">SS</span> bonds, and amino acid composition within 6 months; however, it showed a significant decrease in surface hydrophobicity and a significant increase in total free SH and total SH including <span class="gene">SS</span> <span class="trait">content</span> after 6 months. Analysis of the secondary structure showed a significant increase in alpha-helix <span class="trait">content,</span> but a significant decrease in beta-sheet <span class="trait">content</span> after 3 months. For the other three conditions, no significant changes occurred to the structures of beta-conglycinin when compared to the control. The molecular mass of beta-conglycinin remained in the range of 199-212 kDa for all conditions during the entire storage periods.

						A set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from soybean vars. Kefeng No.1 x Nannong 1138-2 was used to construct a genetic linkage map. The two parents exhibit contrasting characteristics for most of the traits that were mapped. Using restricted fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we mapped 452 markers onto 21 linkage groups and covered 3595.9 cM of the soybean genome. All of the linkage groups except linkage group F were consistent with those of the consensus map of Cregan et al. (1999). Linkage group F was divided into two linkage groups, F1 and F2. The map consisted of 189 RFLPs, 219 SSRs, 40 ESTs, three R gene loci and one phenotype marker. Ten agronomic traits-days to flowering, days to maturity, plant height, number of nodes on main stem, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> number of pods per node, protein <span class="trait">content,</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> 100-seed weight, and plot yield-were studied. Using winqtlcart, we detected 63 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had LOD&gt;3 for nine of the agronomic traits (only exception being <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content)</span> and mapped these on 12 linkage groups. Most of the QTLs were clustered, especially on groups B1 and C2. Some QTLs were mapped to the same loci. This pleiotropism was common for most of the QTLs, and one QTL could influence at most five traits. Seven EST markers were found to be linked closely with or located at the same loci as the QTLs. EST marker <span class="gene">GmKF059a,</span> encoding a repressor protein and mapped on group C2, accounted for about 20% of the total variation of days to flowering, plant height, <span class="trait">lodging</span> and nodes on the main stem, respectively.

						Soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.) seeds vary in their surface properties. The lustre, or glossiness, of seeds has been classified into several different phenotypes. Soybean seeds that have a dull lustre or moderate bloom (B) may also have abundant <span class="trait">seed</span> surface protein, namely, an abundance of the hydrophobic protein from soybean (HPS). The <span class="trait">seed</span> surface protein <span class="gene">HPS</span> is an allergen (Gly m 1) that causes asthma in persons allergic to soybean dust. In this study, <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre and surface protein <span class="trait">content</span> are compared among 71 different soybean cultivars and lines. Dull-seeded phenotypes usually possessed abundant surface protein in comparison to shiny-seeded types, although exceptions were observed. An F2 population of 82 individuals from a cross of OX281 (dull lustre, abundant HPS) and Mukden (shiny lustre, trace amounts of HPS) provided a basis for inheritance studies and genetic mapping analysis. Results indicate that dull <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre (B) and surface protein (Hps) loci are dominant Mendelian traits that cosegregate and map to soybean linkage group E. Molecular markers were used to construct a genetic map of 28 cM encompassing B and Hps. Two different molecular markers cosegregated with each of the loci. This study provides additional evidence that Hps may play a role in the adhesion of endocarp tissues to the <span class="trait">seed,</span> and offers new methods of selection for <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre and surface protein composition in soybean.

Merr.] <span class="trait">yield</span> data for the 2800 crop heat unit area of Ontario for <span class="gene">MET</span> in the period 1994-1999 revealed yearly crossover genotype by site interactions. The eastern Ontario site Winchester showed a different genotype response pattern from the three southwestern Ontario sites in four of the six years. The interactions were not large enough to divide the area into different mega-environments as when analyzed over years, a single cultivar yielded the best in all four sites. The southwestern site, St. Pauls, was found to always group together with at least one of the other three sites; it did not provide unique information on genotype performance. Therefore, in future cultivar evaluations, Winchester should always be used but St. Pauls can be dismissed. Applying GT biplot to the 1994-1999 multiple trait data illustrated that GT biplots graphically displayed the interrelationships among <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> oil <span class="trait">content,</span> protein <span class="trait">content,</span> plant height, and days to maturity, among other traits, and facilitated visual cultivar comparisons and selection. It was found that selection for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> alone was not only the simplest, but also the most effective strategy in the early stages of soybean breeding.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the major storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. During germination, stored reserves are used as a source of nutrients by the plant seedling. Phytic acid is degraded by the activity of phytases to <span class="trait">yield</span> inositol and free phosphate. Due to the lack of phytases in the non-ruminant digestive tract, monogastric animals cannot utilize dietary phytic acid and it is excreted into manure. High phytic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in manure results in elevated phosphorus levels in soil and water and accompanying environmental concerns. The use of phytases to degrade <span class="trait">seed</span> phytic acid has potential for reducing the negative environmental impact of livestock production. A phytase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cotyledons of germinated soybeans <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max L. Merr.). Peptide sequence data generated from the purified enzyme facilitated the cloning of the phytase sequence <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> employing a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The introduction of <span class="gene">GmPhy</span> into soybean tissue culture resulted in increased phytase activity in transformed cells, which confirmed the identity of the phytase gene. It is surprising that the soybean phytase was unrelated to previously characterized microbial or maize (Zea mays) phytases, which were classified as histidine acid phosphatases. The soybean phytase sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity to purple acid phosphatases, a class of metallophosphoesterases.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits of beta-conglycinin was suppressed by sequence-mediated gene silencing in transgenic soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> The resulting seeds had similar total oil and protein <span class="trait">content</span> and ratio compared with the parent line. The decrease in beta-conglycinin protein was apparently compensated by an increased accumulation of glycinin. In addition, proglycinin, the precursor of glycinin, was detected as a prominent polypeptide band in the protein profile of the transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> extract. Electron microscopic analysis and immunocytochemistry of maturing transgenic soybean seeds indicated that the process of storage protein accumulation was altered in the transgenic line. In normal soybeans, the storage proteins are deposited in pre-existing vacuoles by Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, in transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> with reduced beta-conglycinin levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles were observed that resembled precursor accumulating-vesicles of pumpkin seeds and the protein bodies accumulated by cereal seeds. Their ER-derived membrane of the novel vesicles did not contain the protein storage vacuole tonoplast-specific protein alpha-TIP, and the sequestered polypeptides did not contain complex glycans, indicating a preGolgi and nonvacuolar nature. Glycinin was identified as a major component of these novel protein bodies and its diversion from normal storage protein trafficking appears to be related to the proglycinin buildup in the transgenic <span class="trait">seed.</span> The stable accumulation of proteins in a protein body compartment instead of vacuolar accumulation of proteins may provide an alternative intracellular site to sequester proteins when soybeans are used as protein factories.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A variegated leaf mutant in soybean <span class="trait">[Glycine</span> max (L.) Merr.] has been identified and characterized. E25-10 was derived by exposure of seeds of the "Williams' 82" cultivar to gamma-radiation. In this mutant, yellow leaf sectors contain defective chloroplasts, in which the thylakoid membranes are presented as long, parallel structures with little or no overlap. No starch grains have been detected in the mutant chloroplasts. Small vesicles and plastoglobuli can be found within the defective chloroplasts. Genetic studies revealed that a single nuclear-encoded gene is responsible for the mutation in E25-10. The total chlorophyll <span class="trait">content</span> is reduced in yellow leaf tissue by 70-80%. However, the chlorophyll a/b ratio is not altered. The absorbance spectrum of pigments in the mutant leaf tissue differed from that of the green extracts in the range of 400-500 nm. This reduction in total chlorophyll and the change in the absorbance spectrum pattern in the yellow tissue is related to a loss of certain photosynthetic complexes. Green gel analysis revealed that four major pigment-protein complexes (CP1, LHCP1, LHCP2, and CPa) of the thylakoid membranes were absent in the E25-10 mutant. Lithium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that at least 5-6 polypeptides (51, 44, 25, 15, 13, and 12 kDa) were missing in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts from the yellow tissue. Changes in chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded gene message levels were detected. The <span class="gene">psaA</span> transcripts which code for the P700 apoprotein in PSI were reduced in chloroplasts from the E25-10 mutant yellow tissue. The levels of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) and light harvest complex protein (LHCP) of PSII mRNA appeared to be reduced slightly in the mutant plants. However, a much more significant reduction in the 16S rRNA and the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcS) expression was detected in the yellow leaf sectors. Our results suggest that the possible lesion in E25-10 is located in the photosystem I even though fewer grana were observed in the defective chloroplasts.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Four subunits of beta-conglycinin were purified from soybean cultivar CX 635-1-1-1, and were designated alpha, alpha', beta, and beta' in accordance with nomenclature proposed by Thanh and Shibasaki [(1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 490, 370-384]. Of these subunits, beta' has not previously been reported or characterized. Consistent with the low levels of methionine in these proteins, cyanogen bromide cleavage of alpha', alpha, and beta' subunits produced only a few fragments. The beta subunit contains no methionine and was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits are homologous, and each has valine at its amino terminus. The beta subunit has a very different NH2-terminal sequence from those of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits, and has leucine at its amino terminus. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta' subunit could not be determined, as it appeared to be blocked to Edman degradation. Although alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits have similar NH2-terminal sequences, they differ in the number of methionine residues and so yielded different numbers of cyanogen bromide fragments. Two cyanogen bromide fragments (CB-1 and CB-2) were purified from the alpha subunit. CB-1 originated from the NH2-terminal end of the subunit. The amino acid sequence of CB-2 was identical to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clone pB36. The insert in pB36 encoded 216 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of the alpha subunit and contained a 138-bp trailer sequence which was followed by a poly-(A) tail. Maps showing the relative positions of methionine residues and carbohydrate moieties in the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits were drawn, based on primary sequence data, and the size and carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of the CNBr fragments derived from the subunits.
