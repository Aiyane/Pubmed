				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, we isolated and characterized three distinct orthologues of <span class="gene">WRI1</span> in soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) that display different organ-specific expression patterns, among which <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> was highly expressed in maturing soybean <span class="trait">seed</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soybean seeds overexpressing <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter showed the increased total oil and fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> and the changed fatty acid composition.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We conclude that <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> transcription factor can positively regulate oil accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> by a complex gene expression network related to fatty acid biosynthesis.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> max) 'Forrest' was screened to identify mutants within the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> gene.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutants were identified to have high levels of <span class="trait">seed,</span> nodule, and leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybeans carrying <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid <span class="trait">content,</span> and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Finally, we report that <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid <span class="trait">content</span> and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In both experiments, the use of cysteine, only in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and in both <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> and catalase.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Also in both experiments, the use of phenylalanine increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> when the application was carried out as foliar application or both in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the field experiment, the application of glutamate led to an increase in the activity of the catalase and <span class="gene">PAL</span> enzymes for <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Such modifications include functional reduction of <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a/GmWRI1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to WRI1, complementary non-allelic dosage effects of the <span class="gene">GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to LEC1, pseudogenization of the singleton <span class="gene">GmLEC2</span> relevant to LEC2, and the rise of the LEC2-like function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b,</span> contrasting to its homoeolog <span class="gene">GmABI3a,</span> which maintains the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)-like function in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation and dormancy.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b</span> in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil biosynthesis was fulfilled by direct binding to a RY (CATGCA) cis-regulatory element in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> promoter, which was absent in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> promoter, resulting in reduction of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> expression.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The ZF351 haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean <span class="trait">(Glycine</span> soja) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <span class="trait">seed</span> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> expression leads to increased <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content</span> in cultivated soybean.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <span class="trait">seed</span> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Initially, variants of a type 1 <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from a high-oil, high-oleic acid plant <span class="trait">seed,</span> Corylus americana, were screened for high oil <span class="trait">content</span> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nearly all <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants examined from high-oil strains had increased affinity for oleoyl-CoA, with S0.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed-preferred expression of this soybean <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> variant increased oil <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean seeds by an average of 3% (16% relative increase) in highly replicated, single-location field trials.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <span class="gene">DGAT</span> transgenes significantly reduced the soluble carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of mature seeds and increased the <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> of some events.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This study demonstrated that engineering of the native <span class="gene">DGAT</span> enzyme is an effective strategy to improve the oil <span class="trait">content</span> and value of soybeans.

						In order to detect presence and quantity of Roundup Ready (RR) soybean in crude oil extracted from soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> with a different percentage of <span class="gene">GMO</span> <span class="trait">seed</span> two extraction methods were used, CTAB and DNeasy Plant Mini Kit.

						The results of quantification evidently showed that if the oil samples originate from soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> with varying percentage of RR, it is possible to monitor the <span class="gene">GMO</span> <span class="trait">content</span> at the first stage of processing crude oil.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This work reports a detailed characterization of <span class="trait">Glycine</span> max UreG <span class="gene">(GmUreG),</span> a urease accessory protein.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two forms of native <span class="gene">GmUreG,</span> purified from seeds, were separated by metal affinity chromatography, and their properties (GTPase activity in absence and presence of Ni(2+) or Zn(2+), secondary structure and metal <span class="trait">content)</span> were compared with the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Given that one of these genes, <span class="gene">GmBAS1,</span> was expressed at a much higher level than the other <span class="gene">(GmBAS2)</span> in various tissues including the developing seeds, we constructed two RNAi vectors that encode self-complementary hairpin RNAs corresponding to the distinct regions of <span class="gene">GmBAS1</span> under the control of a seed-specific promoter derived from the soybean gene for the α' subunit of the <span class="trait">seed</span> storage protein β-conglycinin.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A comparative analysis of genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in RCAT Angora (high <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) and Harovinton (low <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) revealed that <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 were expressed at significantly greater level in RCAT Angora than in Harovinton.
