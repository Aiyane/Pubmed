						Soybean ( <italic> Glycine </italic> <italic> max </italic> L.) is an important crop worldwide. Reduction of biomass production and nutritional quality has been observed in crops grown on metal-contaminated soils. Previous studies in soybean indicated that 0&#x02013;2.0 mM Cd severely inhibited plant growth, and in response to Cd exposure both the amount of non-enzymatic antioxidants and activities of enzymatic antioxidants were elicited [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-ijerph-09-02827"> 8 </xref> ]. Oxidative stress and enhanced root noodle senescence were observed in soybean plants subjected to Cd exposure [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-ijerph-09-02827"> 9 </xref> ]. A heme oxygenase also implicated in the protection of soybean leaves against Cd stress [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-ijerph-09-02827"> 10 </xref> ]. To the best of our knowledge, however, only a few studies have ever focused on the effects of Cd exposure on the early stage of ontogenesis in germinating soybean seeds [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-ijerph-09-02827"> 11 </xref> ]. This present study attempted to investigate the impact of imbibition with Cd on proline content, oxidative stress as indicated by lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant mechanism as presented by FRAP, GSH content and <span class="gene">GST</span> activity, in germinating soybean seeds. The present work shall help to explain the oxidative and antioxidative response of germinating seeds subjected to <span class="trait">cadmium</span> treatment.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two-way ANOVA indicated that exposure time affected significantly all these parameters measured in the experiment ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-09-02827-t002"> Table 2 </xref> ). Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> impacted markedly MDA content and proline content as well as <span class="gene">GST</span> activity, while the interaction of exposure time and <span class="trait">cadmium</span> <span class="trait">concentration</span> has a profound effect on MDA and proline contents ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-09-02827-t002"> Table 2 </xref> ). Significant difference was also observed between treatments (different <span class="trait">cadmium</span> <span class="trait">concentration)</span> for MDA content and <span class="trait">cadmium</span> <span class="trait">concentration</span> in germinating seeds. Similarly, significant difference was also found between exposure time in all these parameters measured except for <span class="gene">GST</span> activity.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Cadmium</span> is a well known non-essential element that causes oxidative stress in plants. Most attention so far has been paid to the effects of Cd exposure on seedlings or adult plants, and we know little about the oxidative stress and antioxidant mechanisms in germinating seeds. The present study indicated that, challenged by Cd, MDA content and proline level of germinating soybean seeds responded in a exposure time, treatment <span class="trait">concentration</span> and exposure time &#x000d7; treatment <span class="trait">concentration</span> interacting manner; at Cd200 <span class="gene">GST</span> responded to both the exposure time and treatment <span class="trait">concentration,</span> while FRAP and GSH responded to exposure time ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-09-02827-t002"> Table 2 </xref> ). Although soybean seeds germinated under all treatment concentrations, <span class="trait">seed</span> germination at higher <span class="trait">concentration,</span> <italic> i </italic> . <italic> e </italic> ., Cd100 and Cd200, was delayed (Yang <italic> et </italic> <italic> al </italic> ., personal observation). In addition, Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> in germinating seeds increased with increasing exposure time and treatment <span class="trait">concentration</span> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-09-02827-t001"> Table 1 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">GST</span> activity was measured following the method of Cui <italic> et </italic> <italic> al </italic> . [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37-ijerph-09-02827"> 37 </xref> ] with small modification. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;L <span class="trait">seed</span> extract was mixed with 2.95 mL sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 10 &#x003bc;M reduced glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich, AR). The reaction was started by adding 40 &#x003bc;L 1-chloro-2,4-dinithrobenzene (BBI, AR). The change of absorbance was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for 2.5 min (P-general, TU1810AP, Beijing, China). One unit (U) is the amount of enzyme producing 1 &#x003bc;mol conjugate produced in one minute. The activity was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 9.6 mM <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> cm <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> and expressed as U mg <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> FW.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Cadmium</span> (Cd) is a pollutant metal present in soils and toxic to biologic organisms. Previous studies using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) cultivars Harosoy and Fukuyutaka revealed a major quantitative trait loci for <span class="trait">seed</span> Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> (cd1) in chromosome 9. The genome sequence of Williams 82 suggested that a P(1B)-ATPase gene involved in the transport of metals was located in the vicinity of cd1. cDNA sequencing suggested existence of two types of transcripts: one <span class="gene">(GmHMA1a)</span> consisting of 9 exons and 8 introns and the other <span class="gene">(GmHMA1b)</span> consisting of 8 exons and 7 introns. The putative polypeptide, <span class="gene">GmHMA1a,</span> consisted of 885 amino acids, whereas premature termination of translation of <span class="gene">GmHMA1b</span> generated a putative polypeptide with 559 amino acids. <span class="gene">GmHMA1a</span> had a 49.8% similarity with AtHMA3, a P(1B)-ATPase of Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmHMA1a</span> of Fukuyutaka differed from that of Harosoy by a single-base substitution that led to an amino acid substitution from E to G at amino acid position 608. A derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker was developed to detect the base substitution, and this dCAPS marker was successfully associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> Cd <span class="trait">concentration.</span> Transgenic experiments may be necessary to verify that <span class="gene">GmHMA1</span> actually corresponds to cd1.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Cadmium</span> is a highly toxic heavy metal for both plants and animals. The presence of Cd in agricultural soils is of major concern regarding its entry into the food chain, since Cd compounds are readily taken up by plants, and accumulated in edible parts due to their high solubility. In this study, we first demonstrate the high capacity for Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> of soybean grains. Consequently, we considered the study and characterization of the molecular determinants of Cd accumulation -such as metallothioneins (MT)- to be of major practical importance. We report here the first characterization of the soybean MT system, with the identification of nine genes (one of which is a truncated pseudogene), belonging to the four plant MT types. The most highly expressed of each type was chosen for further function analysis. All of them are expressed at high levels in soybean tissues: <span class="gene">GmMT1,</span> <span class="gene">GmMT2</span> and <span class="gene">GmMT3</span> in roots, shoots and seeds, and <span class="gene">GmMT4</span> only in seeds. The corresponding recombinant soybean MTs, synthesized in Escherichia coli cells cultured in metal supplemented media, exhibit greater <span class="trait">cadmium</span> than zinc binding capacity. These results suggest a definite role of <span class="gene">GmMTs</span> in Cd(II) accumulation as one of the main responses of soybean to an overload of this metal.

						Soybean has long been a staple food for Asians, especially as soymilk, tofu, and oil [ <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"> 20 </xref> ]. Many soybean cultivars can accumulate high Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> in <span class="trait">seed</span> when grown on Cd-polluted soil [ <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> 4 </xref> , <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr"> 21 </xref> ]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed an upper limit of 0.2&#x02009;mg/kg Cd <span class="trait">concentration</span> in safety soybean seeds [ <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr"> 22 </xref> ]. Genetic studies on recombinant inbred line populations have shown that Cd accumulation in soybean seeds is controlled by a major locus <italic> Cda1 </italic> on linkage group K [ <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"> 23 </xref> , <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> 24 </xref> ]. The <italic> <span class="gene">GmHMA3</span> </italic> located at the <italic> Cda1 </italic> locus was demonstrated to sequester Cd in roots to limit Cd transportation into shoots [ <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr"> 25 </xref> ]. Because the regulation of metal homeostasis is complex, other metal-specific transport proteins and metal nonspecific genes may be involved. In our previous study, five metal nonspecific genes, a receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (RSTK, glyma09g06160), a plasma membrane H <sup> + </sup> -transporting ATPase (H <sup> + </sup> -ATPase, glyma09g06250), an iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein nfu-related (ISCP, glyma09g06300), and two uncharacterized conserved protein (UCP1, glyma09g06220, and UCP2, glyma09g06310), were found at the <italic> Cda1 </italic> locus [ <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"> 23 </xref> ].
