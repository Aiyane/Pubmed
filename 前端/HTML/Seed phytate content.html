				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol can be converted into phytic acid <span class="trait">(phytate),</span> the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to <span class="trait">phytate</span> has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate <span class="gene">(GmMIPS1)</span> gene. We have observed an absence of <span class="trait">seed</span> development in lines in which the presence of <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic reduction of <span class="trait">phytate</span> (InsP6) <span class="trait">content</span> was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> gene expression and <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

The reduction in IP6 levels in transgenic seeds compared to control 'Jack' soybeans ranged from 12.6 to 24.8 as determined by HPLC.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the major storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. During germination, stored reserves are used as a source of nutrients by the plant seedling. Phytic acid is degraded by the activity of phytases to <span class="trait">yield</span> inositol and free phosphate. Due to the lack of phytases in the non-ruminant digestive tract, monogastric animals cannot utilize dietary phytic acid and it is excreted into manure. High phytic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in manure results in elevated phosphorus levels in soil and water and accompanying environmental concerns. The use of phytases to degrade <span class="trait">seed</span> phytic acid has potential for reducing the negative environmental impact of livestock production. A phytase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cotyledons of germinated soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.). Peptide sequence data generated from the purified enzyme facilitated the cloning of the phytase sequence <span class="gene">(GmPhy)</span> employing a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The introduction of <span class="gene">GmPhy</span> into soybean tissue culture resulted in increased phytase activity in transformed cells, which confirmed the identity of the phytase gene. It is surprising that the soybean phytase was unrelated to previously characterized microbial or maize (Zea mays) phytases, which were classified as histidine acid phosphatases. The soybean phytase sequence exhibited a high degree of similarity to purple acid phosphatases, a class of metallophosphoesterases.

						Reduction of phytic acid in soybean seeds has the potential to improve the nutritional value of soybean meal and lessen phosphorus pollution in large scale animal farming. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of two new low phytic acid (LPA) mutations on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits. Multilocation/season comparative analyses showed that the two mutations did not affect the concentration of crude protein, any of the individual amino acids, crude oil, and individual saturated fatty acids. Among other traits, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW75-1</span> had consistently higher sucrose contents (+47.4-86.1%) and lower raffinose contents (-74.2 to -84.3%) than those of wild type (WT) parent Taiwan 75; <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had higher total isoflavone contents (3038.8-4305.4 microg/g) than its parent Zhechun # 3 (1583.6-2644.9 microg/g) in all environments. Further tests of homozygous F(3) progenies of the cross <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> x Wuxing # 4 (WT variety) showed that LPA lines had a mean <span class="trait">content</span> of total isoflavone significantly higher than WT lines. This study demonstrated that two LPA mutant genes have no negative effects on <span class="trait">seed</span> quality and nutritional traits; they instead have the potential to improve a few other properties. Therefore, these two mutant genes are valuable genetic resources for breeding high quality soybean varieties.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is important to the nutritional quality of soybean meal. Organic phosphorus (P) in PA is indigestible in humans and non-ruminant animals, which affects nutrition and causes P pollution of ground water from animal wastes. Two novel soybean [(Glycine max L. (Merr.)] low phytic acid (lpa) mutations were isolated and characterized. <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a phytic acid P (PA-P) reduction of 66.6% and a sixfold increase in inorganic P (Pi), and <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had a PA-P reduction of 46.3% and a 1.4-fold increase in Pi, compared with their respective non-mutant progenitor lines. The reduction of PA-P and increase of Pi in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> were molar equivalent; the decrease of PA-P in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> however, was accompanied by the increase of both Pi and lower inositol phosphates. In both mutant lines, the total P <span class="trait">content</span> remained similar to their wild type parents. The two lpa mutations were both inherited in a single recessive gene model but were non-allelic. Sequence data and progeny analysis indicate that <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> lpa mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in the soybean D: -myo-inositol 3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1 EC 5.5.1.4) gene 1 (MIPS1). The lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was mapped on LG B2, closely linked with microsatellite loci Satt416 and Satt168, at genetic distances of approximately 4.63 and approximately 9.25 cM, respectively. Thus this mutation probably represents a novel soybean lpa locus. The <span class="trait">seed</span> emergence rate of <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> was similar to its progenitor line and was not affected by <span class="trait">seed</span> source and its lpa mutation. However, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW-1</span> had a significantly reduced field emergence when seeds were produced in a subtropic environment. Field tests of the mutants and their progenies further demonstrated that the lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> does not negatively affect plant <span class="trait">yield</span> traits. These results will advance understanding of the genetic, biochemical and molecular control of PA synthesis in soybean. The novel lpa mutation in <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2,</span> together with linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, will be of value for breeding productive lpa soybeans, with meal high in digestible Pi eventually to improve animal nutrition and lessen environmental pollution.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the presented study the influence of dehulling rapeseed on the composition of rapeseed meal (RM) and rapeseed cake (RC) and on its feed value for piglets and growing-finishing pigs was investigated. Before withdrawal of oil, rapeseed (variety Express) was dehulled applying a procedure developed by SKET <span class="gene">GmbH</span> Magdeburg and the Section Food-Technology of the University Essen. The steps of the dehulling procedure were described. For RM the oil was removed by the prepress-solvent procedure till a crude fat <span class="trait">content</span> of 2.1% in DM. RC was produced by pressing only resulting approximately 13% crude fat in DM. The RM and RC from not dehulled (ND) and dehulled (D) rapeseed were examined analytically. Crude nutrients, sugar and fibre substances, amino acids, some minerals and trace elements, fatty acids, glucosinolates and sinapine, and <span class="trait">phytate</span> were determined. By dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> the crude fibre <span class="trait">content</span> was decreased in RM and RC by approximately 40%. The ADF <span class="trait">content</span> declined by 35 and 39%, and the NDF <span class="trait">content</span> by 28% and 40% in RM and RC, respectively. The decrease in ADL <span class="trait">content</span> amounted to 50% and 65% for RM and RC, respectively. On the other hand, the CP <span class="trait">content</span> of RM and RC was increased by 7% and 13%, respectively, by dehulling the <span class="trait">seed</span> while the amino acid <span class="trait">content</span> of rape protein increased only slightly. The contents of glucosinolates and sinapine were also increased by dehulling, while the contents of <span class="trait">phytate</span> and <span class="trait">phytate</span> P were decreased. In digestibility and balance experiments with piglets and intact hybrid breeds of growing-finishing pigs, the digestibility of organic matter and of crude nutrients and the contents of digestible energy and metabolizable energy were estimated. Furthermore, the precaecal digestibility of crude nutrients and amino acids was determined with fistulated mini-pigs. By dehulling the seeds the digestibility of organic matter from RM and RC was improved in piglets and adult pigs by approximately 10%, and the ME contents increased by 13-15%. The precaecal digestibility of the sum of amino acids was increased by approximately 3 and 6 units in RM and RC, respectively. The precaecal digestibility of lysine in RM and RC reached that of soybean oil meal from not dehulled beans.
