						The plant-specific NAC transcription factors play important roles in plant response to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Here, we have compared the expression levels of a subset of <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes in drought-tolerant DT51 and drought-sensitive MTD720 under both normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions aimed at identifying correlation between <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> expression levels and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> degree, as well as potential <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> candidates for genetic engineering. The expression of 23 selected dehydration-responsive <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> was assessed in both stressed and unstressed root tissues of DT51 and MTD720 using real-time quantitative PCR. The results indicated that expression of <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> was genotype-dependent. Seven and 13 of 23 tested <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> showed higher expression levels in roots of DT51 in comparison with MTD720 under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions, respectively, whereas none of them displayed lower transcript levels under any conditions. This finding suggests that the higher <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of DT51 might be positively correlated with the higher induction of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes during water deficit. The drought-inducible <span class="gene">GmNAC011</span> needs to be mentioned as its transcript accumulation was more than 76-fold higher in drought-stressed DT51 roots relative to MTD720 roots. Additionally, among the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes examined, <span class="gene">GmNAC085,</span> 092, 095, 101 and 109 were not only drought-inducible but also more highly up-regulated in DT51 roots than in that of MTD720 under both treatment conditions. These data together suggest that <span class="gene">GmNAC011,</span> 085, 092, 095, 101 and 109 might be promising candidates for improvement of <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean by biotechnological approaches.

						NAC transcription factors are known to be involved in regulation of plant responses to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. In this study, the expression of 23 drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was assessed in the shoot tissues of DT51 and MTD720, the two soybean varieties with contrasting drought-responsive phenotypes, by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Results indicated that expression profile of <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was genotype-dependent, and six <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> <span class="gene">(GmNAC019,</span> 043, 062, 085, 095 and 101) had higher transcript levels in the shoots of the drought-tolerant DT51 in comparison with the drought-sensitive MTD720 under <span class="trait">drought.</span> Our study suggests a positive correlation between the higher <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> degree of DT51 versus MTD720 and the up-regulation of at least these six drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> in the shoot tissues. Furthermore, on the basis of our analysis, three genes, <span class="gene">GmNAC043,</span> 085 and 101, were identified as promising candidates for development of drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by genetic engineering.

						BACKGROUND: The purpose of this project was to identify metabolites, proteins, genes, and promoters associated with water stress responses in soybean. A number of these may serve as new targets for the biotechnological improvement of <span class="trait">drought</span> responses in soybean (Glycine max). RESULTS: We identified metabolites, proteins, and genes that are strongly up or down regulated during rapid water stress following removal from a hydroponics system. 163 metabolites showed significant changes during water stress in roots and 93 in leaves. The largest change was a root-specific 160-fold increase in the coumestan coumestrol making it a potential biomarker for <span class="trait">drought</span> and a promising target for improving <span class="trait">drought</span> responses. Previous reports suggest that coumestrol stimulates mycorrhizal colonization and under certain conditions mycorrhizal plants have improved <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> This suggests that coumestrol may be part of a call for help to the rhizobiome during stress. About 3,000 genes were strongly up-regulated by <span class="trait">drought</span> and we identified regulators such as ERF, MYB, NAC, bHLH, and WRKY transcription factors, receptor-like kinases, and calcium signaling components as potential targets for soybean improvement as well as the jasmonate and abscisic acid biosynthetic genes JMT, LOX1, and ABA1. <span class="trait">Drought</span> stressed soybean leaves show reduced mRNA levels of stomatal development genes including FAMA-like, MUTE-like and SPEECHLESS-like bHLH transcription factors and leaves formed after <span class="trait">drought</span> stress had a reduction in stomatal density of 22.34 % and stomatal index of 17.56 %. This suggests that reducing stomatal density may improve <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> MEME analyses suggest that ABRE (CACGT/CG), CRT/DRE (CCGAC) and a novel GTGCnTGC/G element play roles in transcriptional activation and these could form components of synthetic promoters to drive expression of transgenes. Using transformed hairy roots, we validated the increase in promoter activity of <span class="gene">GmWRKY17</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY67</span> during dehydration and after 20 μM ABA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our toolbox provides new targets and strategies for improving soybean <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and includes the coumestan coumestrol, transcription factors that regulate stomatal density, water stress-responsive WRKY gene promoters and a novel DNA element that appears to be enriched in water stress responsive promoters.

						BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely known for their broad-spectrum control of arthropod pests. Recently, their effects on plant physiological mechanisms have been characterized as producing a stress shield, which is predicted to enhance <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to adverse conditions. Here we investigate the molecular underpinnings of the stress shield concept using the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam in two separate experiments that compare gene expression. We hypothesized that the application of a thiamethoxam seed treatment to soybean would alter the expression of genes involved in plant defensive pathways and general stress response in later vegetative growth. First, we used next-generation sequencing to examine the broad scale transcriptional effects of the thiamethoxam seed treatment at three vegetative stages in soybean. Second, we selected ten target genes associated with plant defense pathways in soybean and examined the interactive effects of thiamethoxam seed treatment and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress on expression using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Direct comparison of thiamethoxam-treated and untreated soybeans revealed minor transcriptional differences. However, when examined across vegetative stages, the thiamethoxam seed treatment induced substantial transcriptional changes that were not observed in untreated plants. Genes associated with photosynthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, development of the cell wall and membrane organization were uniquely upregulated between vegetative stages in thiamethoxam-treated plants. In addition, several genes associated with phytohormone and oxidative stress responses were downregulated between vegetative stages. When we examined the expression of a subset of ten genes associated with plant defense and stress response, the application of thiamethoxam was found to interact with <span class="trait">drought</span> stress by enhancing or repressing expression. In <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed plants, thiamethoxam induced (upregulated) expression of a thiamine biosynthetic enzyme (THIZ2) and gibberellin regulated protein (GRP), but repressed (downregulated) the expression of an apetala 2 <span class="gene">(GmDREB2A;2),</span> lipoxygenase (LIP), and SAM dependent carboxyl methyltransferase (SAM). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that a thiamethoxam seed treatment alters the expression soybean genes related to plant defense and stress response both in the presence and absence of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Consistent with the thiamethoxam stress shield concept, several genes associated with phytohormones showed enhanced expression in <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed plants.

						MYB transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of plant growth, developmental metabolism and stress responses. In this study, a new MYB transcription factor gene, <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1,</span> was isolated from soybean [Glycine max (L.)]. The <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> cDNA is 1296bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 816 bp encoding for 271 amino acids. The amino acid sequence displays similarities to the typical R2R3 MYB proteins reported in other plants. Transient expression analysis using the <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1-GFP</span> fusion gene in onion epidermal cells revealed that the <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> protein is targeted to the nucleus. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> expression was induced by abiotic stresses, such as <span class="trait">drought,</span> cold, salt and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Compared to wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> exhibited an enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> and cold stresses. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> has the potential to be utilized in transgenic breeding lines to improve abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

						BACKGROUND: High temperature affects organism growth and metabolic activity. Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) are key regulators in heat shock response in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Under high temperature conditions, Hsfs activate heat shock proteins (Hsps) by combining with heat stress elements (HSEs) in their promoters, leading to defense of heat stress. Since the first plant Hsf gene was identified in tomato, several plant Hsf family genes have been thoroughly characterized. Although soybean (Glycine max), an important oilseed crops, genome sequences have been available, the Hsf family genes in soybean have not been characterized accurately. RESULT: We analyzed the Hsf genetic structures and protein function domains using the GSDS, Pfam, SMART, PredictNLS, and NetNES online tools. The genome scanning of dicots (soybean and Arabidopsis) and monocots (rice and maize) revealed that the whole-genome replication occurred twice in soybean evolution. The plant Hsfs were classified into 3 classes and 16 subclasses according to protein structure domains. The A8 and B3 subclasses existed only in dicots and the A9 and <span class="gene">C2</span> occurred only in monocots. Thirty eight soybean Hsfs were systematically identified and grouped into 3 classes and 12 subclasses, and located on 15 soybean chromosomes. The promoter regions of the soybean Hsfs contained cis-elements that likely participate in <span class="trait">drought,</span> low temperature, and ABA stress responses. There were large differences among Hsfs based on transcriptional levels under the stress conditions. The transcriptional levels of the A1 and A2 subclass genes were extraordinarily high. In addition, differences in the expression levels occurred for each gene in the different organs and at the different developmental stages. Several genes were chosen to determine their subcellular localizations and functions. The subcellular localization results revealed that <span class="gene">GmHsf-04,</span> <span class="gene">GmHsf-33,</span> and <span class="gene">GmHsf-34</span> were located in the nucleus. Overexpression of the <span class="gene">GmHsf-34</span> gene improved the tolerances to <span class="trait">drought</span> and heat stresses in Arabidopsis plants. CONCLUSIONS: This present investigation of the quantity, structural features, expression characteristics, subcellular localizations, and functional roles provides a scientific basis for further research on soybean Hsf functions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MicroRNAs, key posttranscriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression, play important roles in plant development and response to stress. In this study, a soybean gma-MIR394a gene was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in <span class="trait">drought</span> stress <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Expression analysis revealed that gma-MIR394a was expressed differentially in various soybean tissues and was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> high salinity, low temperature stress, and abscisic acid treatment in leaves. One target gene of gma-miR394a, <span class="gene">Glyma08g11030,</span> was predicted and verified using a modified 5' RLM-RACE (RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends) assay. Overexpression of gma-MIR394a resulted in plants with lowered leaf water loss and enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Furthermore, overexpression of gma-MIR394a in Arabidopsis reduced the transcript of an F-box gene <span class="gene">(At1g27340)</span> containing a miR394 complementary target site. These results suggest that the gma-MIR394a gene functions in positive modulation of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and has potential applications in molecular breeding to enhance <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in crops.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The WRKY-type transcription factors are involved in plant development and stress responses, but how the regulation of stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> is related to plant development is largely unknown. GsWRKY20 was initially identified as a stress response gene using large-scale Glycine soja microarrays. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of this gene was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), salt, cold, and <span class="trait">drought.</span> Overexpression of GsWRKY20 in Arabidopsis resulted in a decreased sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth. However, compared with the wild type, GsWRKY20 overexpression lines were more sensitive to ABA in stomatal closure, and exhibited a greater <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, a decreased water loss rate, and a decreased stomatal density. Moreover, microarray and qRT-PCR assays showed that GsWRKY20 mediated ABA signalling by promoting the expression of negative regulators of ABA signalling, such as AtWRKY40, ABI1, and ABI2, while repressing the expression of the positive regulators of ABA, for example ABI5, ABI4, and ABF4. Interestingly, GsWRKY20 also positively regulates the expression of a group of wax biosynthetic genes. Further, evidence is provided to support that GsWRKY20 overexpression lines have more epicuticular wax crystals and a much thicker cuticle, which contribute to less chlorophyll leaching compared with the wild type. Taken together, the findings reveal an important role for GsWRKY20 in enhancing <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and regulating ABA signalling.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean is an important crop that provides valuable proteins and oils for human use. Because soybean growth and development is extremely sensitive to water deficit, quality and crop yields are severely impacted by <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. In the face of limited water resources, drought-responsive genes are therefore of interest. Identification and analysis of dehydration- and rehydration-inducible differentially expressed genes (DEGs) would not only aid elucidation of molecular mechanisms of stress response, but also enable improvement of crop stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> via gene transfer. Using Digital Gene Expression Tag profiling (DGE), a new technique based on Illumina sequencing, we analyzed expression profiles between two soybean genotypes to identify drought-responsive genes. RESULTS: Two soybean genotypes - drought-tolerant Jindou21 and drought-sensitive Zhongdou33 - were subjected to dehydration and rehydration conditions. For analysis of DEGs under dehydration conditions, 20 cDNA libraries were generated from roots and leaves at two different time points under well-watered and dehydration conditions. We also generated eight libraries for analysis under rehydration conditions. Sequencing of the 28 libraries produced 25,000-33,000 unambiguous tags, which were mapped to reference sequences for annotation of expressed genes. Many genes exhibited significant expression differences among the libraries. DEGs in the drought-tolerant genotype were identified by comparison of DEGs among treatments and genotypes. In Jindou21, 518 and 614 genes were differentially expressed under dehydration in leaves and roots, respectively, with 24 identified both in leaves and roots. The main functional categories enriched in these DEGs were metabolic process, response to stresses, plant hormone signal transduction, protein processing, and plant-pathogen interaction pathway; the associated genes primarily encoded transcription factors, protein kinases, and other regulatory proteins. The seven most significantly expressed (|log2 ratio| ≥ 8) genes - <span class="gene">Glyma15g03920,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma05g02470,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma15g15010,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma05g09070,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma06g35630,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma08g12590,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma11g16000</span> - are more likely to determine <span class="trait">drought</span> stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> The expression patterns of eight randomly-selected genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR; the results of QRT-PCR analysis agreed with transcriptional profile data for 96 out of 128 (75%) data points. CONCLUSIONS: Many soybean genes were differentially expressed between drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes. Based on GO functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis, some of these genes encoded transcription factors, protein kinases, and other regulatory proteins. The seven most significant DEGs are candidates for improving soybean <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> These findings will be helpful for analysis and elucidation of molecular mechanisms of <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance;</span> they also provide a basis for cultivating new varieties of drought-tolerant soybean.

						Circadian clocks are a great evolutionary innovation and provide competitive advantage during the day/night cycle and under changing environmental conditions. The circadian clock mediates expression of a large proportion of genes in plants, achieving a harmonious relationship between energy metabolism, photosynthesis, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. Here it is shown that multiple paralogues of clock genes are present in soybean (Glycine max) and mediate flooding and <span class="trait">drought</span> responses. Differential expression of many clock and <span class="gene">SUB1</span> genes was found under flooding and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Furthermore, natural variation in the amplitude and phase shifts in PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> genes was also discovered under <span class="trait">drought</span> and flooding conditions, respectively. PRR3 exhibited flooding- and drought-specific splicing patterns and may work in concert with PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> to achieve energy homeostasis under flooding and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Higher expression of <span class="gene">TOC1</span> also coincides with elevated levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and variation in glucose levels in the morning and afternoon, indicating that this response to abiotic stress is mediated by ABA, endogenous sugar levels, and the circadian clock to fine-tune photosynthesis and energy utilization under stress conditions. It is proposed that the presence of multiple clock gene paralogues with variation in DNA sequence, phase, and period could be used to screen exotic germplasm to find sources for <span class="trait">drought</span> and flooding <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Furthermore, fine tuning of multiple clock gene paralogues (via a genetic engineering approach) should also facilitate the development of flooding- and drought-tolerant soybean varieties.

						Cytokinins (CKs) mediate cellular responses to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and targeted control of CK metabolism can be used to develop drought-tolerant plants. Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, <span class="gene">GmIPT)</span> and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, <span class="gene">GmCKX)</span> genes. Comparative analyses of <span class="gene">GmIPTs</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKXs</span> with Arabidopsis counterparts revealed their similar architecture. The average numbers of abiotic stress-inducible cis-elements per promoter were 0.4 and 1.2 for <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> genes, respectively, suggesting that upregulation of <span class="gene">GmCKXs,</span> thereby reduction of CK levels, maybe the major events under abiotic stresses. Indeed, the expression of 12 <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> genes was upregulated by dehydration in R2 roots. Overall, the expressions of soybean CK metabolic genes in various tissues at various stages were highly responsive to <span class="trait">drought.</span> CK contents in various organs at the reproductive (R2) stage were also determined under well-watered and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions. Although tRNA-type <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> genes were highly expressed in soybean, cis-zeatin and its derivatives were found at low concentrations. Moreover, reduction of total CK content in R2 leaves under <span class="trait">drought</span> was attributable to the decrease in dihydrozeatin levels, suggesting a role of this molecule in regulating soybean's responses to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Our systematic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach.

						Nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), a heterotrimeric transcription factor, is composed of NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC proteins. In plants, there are usually more than 10 genes for each family and their members have been identified to be key regulators in many developmental and physiological processes controlling gametogenesis, embryogenesis, nodule development, seed development, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, flowering time, primary root elongation, blue light responses, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Taking the advantages of the recent soybean genome draft and information on functional characterizations of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factor family in plants, we identified 21 <span class="gene">GmNF-YA,</span> 32 <span class="gene">GmNF-YB,</span> and 15 <span class="gene">GmNF-YC</span> genes in the soybean (Glycine max) genome. Phylogenetic analyses show that soybean's proteins share strong homology to Arabidopsis and many of them are closely related to functionally characterized NF-Y in plants. Expression analysis in various tissues of flower, leaf, root, seeds of different developmental stages, root hairs under rhizobium inoculation, and drought-treated roots and leaves revealed that certain groups of soybean NF-Y are likely involved in specific developmental and stress responses. This study provides extensive evaluation of the soybean NF-Y family and is particularly useful for further functional characterization of <span class="gene">GmNF-Y</span> proteins in seed development, nodulation and <span class="trait">drought</span> adaptation of soybean.

						Here, we aimed to clone and identify the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene related to the salt stress response in soybean. The full-length cDNA sequence of the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene was amplified in soybean using degenerate primers of Mesembrythmum crystallium. To understand the stress response, the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene was cloned and sequenced. Then, the expression vectors of the gene were constructed, and introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana through Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and the salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> was analyzed in the transgenic plants. In addition, the expression patterns of <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene in soybean were analyzed. The expression was examined in different organs (roots, leaves, flower seeds, and stem) and under different stress conditions <span class="trait">(drought,</span> high salt, low temperature, salicylic acid, ethane, abscisic acid, and methyl jasmonate) by real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed that the root, leaves, and stems exhibited high level of <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene expression, whereas there was no expression in the seeds. In addition, the <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> gene expression was upregulated under all stress conditions. Overall, the results clearly indicate that <span class="gene">GmIMT1</span> might be involved in multiple plant response pathways to the different environmental conditions. Furthermore transgenic plants exhibited higher salt-tolerance compared to wild type plants.

						We evaluated the molecular, anatomical and physiological properties of a soybean line transformed to improve <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> with an rd29A:AtDREB1A construct. This construct expressed dehydration- responsive element binding protein DREB1A from the stress-inducible rd29A promoter. The greenhouse growth test included four randomized blocks of soybean plants, with each treatment performed in triplicate. Seeds from the non-transformed soybean cultivar BR16 and from the genetically modified soybean P58 line (T(2) generation) were grown at 15% gravimetric humidity for 31 days. To induce water deficit, the humidity was reduced to 5% gravimetric humidity (moderate stress) for 29 days and then to 2.5% gravimetric humidity (severe stress). AtDREB1A gene expression was higher in the genetically modified P58 plants during water deficit, demonstrating transgene stability in T(2) generations and induction of the rd29A promoter. Drought-response genes, including <span class="gene">GmPI-PLC,</span> <span class="gene">GmSTP,</span> <span class="gene">GmGRP,</span> and <span class="gene">GmLEA14,</span> were highly expressed in plants submitted to severe stress. Genetically modified plants had higher stomatal conductance and consequently higher photosynthetic and transpiration rates. In addition, they had more chlorophyll. Overexpression of AtDREB1A may contribute to a decrease in leaf thickness; however, a thicker abaxial epidermis was observed. Overexpression of AtDREB1A in soybean appears to enhance <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

						BACKGROUND: SKIP is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. It can regulate plant stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in rice and Arabidopsis. But the homolog of SKIP protein in soybean has been not reported up to now. RESULTS: In this study, the expression patterns of soybean GAMYB binding protein gene <span class="gene">(GmGBP1)</span> encoding a homolog of SKIP protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and different day lengths. The expression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was induced by polyethyleneglycol 6000, NaCl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> had transcriptional activity in C-terminal. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> could interact with R2R3 domain of <span class="gene">GmGAMYB1</span> in SKIP domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. In long-day (16 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette leaves; Suppression of AtSKIP in Arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes (CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY); Arabidopsis myb33 mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. In short-day (8 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> flowered later and showed a higher level of FLOWERING LOCUS C compared with wild type. When treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> enhanced the tolerances to heat and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses but reduced the <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In Arabidopsis, <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might positively regulate the flowering time by affecting CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and GAMYB directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in LDs, but <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might represse flowering by affecting FLOWERING LOCUS C and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE in autonomous pathway in SDs. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might regulate the activity of ROS-eliminating to improve the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to heat and <span class="trait">drought</span> but reduce the high-salinity <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Although extensive studies and remarkable progress have been made with Arabidopsis calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), knowledge of their functions in other plant species is still limited. Here we isolated gene <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> from soybean, a homolog of AtCBL1 in Arabidopsis. <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> was differentially induced by multiple abiotic stress and plant hormones, and its transcripts were abundant in seedlings and mature roots. We over-expressed <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> in Arabidopsis and found that it enhanced tolerances to both high salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses in the transgenic plants. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> also promoted hypocotyl elongation under light conditions. <span class="gene">GmCBL1</span> may regulate stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through activation of stress-related genes, and may control hypocotyl development by altering the expression of gibberellin biosynthesis-related genes. This study identifies a putative soybean CBL gene that functions in both stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and light-dependent hypocotyl development.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is a limiting factor for N(2) fixation in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] thereby resulting in reduced biomass accumulation and <span class="trait">yield.</span> Drought-sensitive genotypes accumulate ureides, a product of N(2) fixation, during <span class="trait">drought</span> stress; however, drought-tolerant genotypes have lower shoot ureide concentrations, which appear to alleviate <span class="trait">drought</span> stress on N(2) fixation. A key enzyme involved in ureide breakdown in shoots is allantoate amidohydrolase (AAH). It is hypothesized that <span class="gene">AAH</span> gene expression in soybean determines shoot ureide concentrations during water-deficit stress and is responsible for the differential sensitivities of the N(2)-fixation response to <span class="trait">drought</span> among soybean genotypes. The objectives were to examine the relationship between <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcript levels and shoot ureide concentration and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Drought-tolerant (Jackson) and drought-sensitive (Williams) genotypes were subjected to three water-availability treatments: well-watered control, moderate water-deficit stress, and severe water-deficit stress. Shoot ureide concentrations were examined, in addition to gene expression of <span class="gene">AAH</span> and DREB2, a gene expressed during water-deficit stress. As expected, <span class="gene">DREB2</span> expression was detected only during severe water-deficit stress, and shoot ureide concentrations were greatest in the drought-sensitive genotype relative to the drought-tolerant genotype during water-deficit stress. However, expression of <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcripts was similar among water treatments and genotypes, indicating that <span class="gene">AAH</span> mRNA was not closely associated with <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Ureide concentrations in shoots were weakly associated with <span class="gene">AAH</span> mRNA levels. These results indicate that <span class="gene">AAH</span> expression is probably not associated with the increased ureide catabolism observed in drought-tolerant genotypes, such as Jackson. Further study of <span class="gene">AAH</span> at the post-translational and enzymatic levels is warranted in order to dissect the potential role of this gene in <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant U-box (PUB) E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in hormone signaling pathways and response to abiotic stresses, but little is known about them in soybean, Glycine max. Here, we identified and characterized 125 PUB genes from the soybean genome, which were classified into eight groups according to their protein domains. Soybean PUB genes <span class="gene">(GmPUB</span> genes) are broadly expressed in many tissues and are a little more abundant in the roots than in the other tissues. Nine <span class="gene">GmPUB</span> genes, <span class="gene">GmPUB1-GmPUB9,</span> showed induced expression patterns by <span class="trait">drought,</span> and the expression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> was also induced by exogenous ABA and NaCl. <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> was localized to post-Golgi compartments, interacting with <span class="gene">GmE2</span> protein as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, and showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by in vitro ubiquitination assay. Heterogeneous overexpression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> in Arabidopsis showed decreased <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance,</span> enhanced sensitivity with respect to osmotic and salt stress inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth, and inhibited ABA- and mannitol-mediated stomatal closure. Eight <span class="trait">drought</span> stress-related genes were less induced in <span class="gene">GmPUB8-overexpressing</span> Arabidopsis after <span class="trait">drought</span> treatment compared with the wild type and the pub23 mutant. Taken together, our results suggested that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> might negatively regulate plant response to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. In addition, Y2H and BiFC showed that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> interacted with soybean COL (CONSTANS LIKE) protein. <span class="gene">GmPUB8-overexpressing</span> Arabidopsis flowered earlier under middle- and short-day conditions but later under long-day conditions, indicating that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> might regulate flowering time in the photoperiod pathway. This study helps us to understand the functions of PUB E3 ubiquitin ligases in soybean.

						Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor composed of NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a gene, <span class="gene">GmNFYA3,</span> which encodes the NF-YA subunit of the NF-Y complex in soybeans (Glycine max L.). Real time RT-PCR analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses, such as polyethylene glycol, NaCl and cold. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> may activate its specific targets in the nucleus. Histochemical β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining revealed that the expression of the GUS gene driven by the <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> promoter occurred in various transgenic Arabidopsis tissues. Coexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana and 5' RACE assays indicated that miR169 directs <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> mRNA cleavage in vivo. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> resulted in Arabidopsis with reduced leaf water loss and enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> In addition, the transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited increased sensitivity to high salinity and exogenous ABA. Moreover, the transcript levels of ABA biosynthesis (ABA1, ABA2), ABA signaling (ABI1, ABI2) and stress-responsive genes, including <span class="gene">RD29A</span> and CBF3, were generally higher in <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> plants than in wild-type controls under normal conditions. These results suggest that the <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> gene functions in positive modulation of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and has potential applications in molecular breeding to enhance <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in crops.

						Ethylene-response factors (ERFs) play an important role in regulating gene expression in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a new ERF transcription factor, <span class="gene">GmERF7,</span> was isolated from soybean. Sequence analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> contained an AP2/ERF domain with 58 amino acids, two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains, an acidic amino acid-rich transcriptional activation domain and a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. The expression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethylene (ETH) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. However, the expression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> decreased under cold treatment. <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> localized to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> protein bound to the GCC-box element in vitro and activated the expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in tobacco leaves. Activities of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> promoter <span class="gene">(GmERF7P)</span> upregulated in tobacco leaves with 10h <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt and ETH treatments. However, activities of <span class="gene">GmERF7P</span> decreased with 10h cold and ABA treatments. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> in tobacco plants led to higher levels of chlorophyll and soluble carbohydrates and a lower level of malondialdehyde compared with wild-type tobacco plants under salt stress conditions, which indicated that <span class="gene">GmERF7</span> enhanced salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in transgenic plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Abscisic acid-responsive element binding protein (AREB1) is a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element motif in the promoter region of ABA-inducible genes. Because <span class="gene">AREB1</span> is not sufficient to direct the expression of downstream genes under non-stress conditions, an activated form of <span class="gene">AREB1</span> (AREB1ΔQT) was created. Several reports claim that plants overexpressing <span class="gene">AREB1</span> or AREB1ΔQT show improved <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> In our studies, soybean plants overexpressing AREB1ΔQT were characterized molecularly, and the phenotype and <span class="trait">drought</span> response of three lines were accessed under greenhouse conditions. Under conditions of water deficit, the transformed plants presented a higher survival rate (100%) than those of their isoline, cultivar BR 16 (40%). Moreover, the transformed plants displayed better water use efficiency and had a higher number of leaves than their isoline. Because the transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductance than its isoline under well-watered conditions, it was suggested that the enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> response of AREB1ΔQT soybean plants might not be associated with altered transpiration rates mediated by ABA-dependent stomatal closure. However, it is possible that the smaller leaf area of the transgenic plants reduced their transpiration and water use, causing delayed stress onset. The difference in the degree of wilting and percentage of survival between the 35S-AREB1ΔQT and wildtype plants may also be related to the regulation of genes that protect against dehydration because metabolic impairment of photosynthesis, deduced by an increasing internal CO2 concentration, was not observed in the transgenic plants.

						The methylation of myo-inositol forms O-methyl inositol (D-ononitol) when plants are under abiotic stress in a reaction catalyzed by myo-inositol methyltransferase (IMT). D-Ononitol can serve as an osmoprotectant that prevents water loss in plants. We isolated the IMT cDNA from Glycine max and found by RT-PCR analysis that <span class="gene">GmIMT</span> transcripts are induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity stress treatments in the leaves of soybean seedlings. We confirmed the protein product of <span class="gene">GmIMT</span> and its substrate using a recombinant system in E. coli. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing <span class="gene">GmIMT</span> displayed improved <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to dehydration stress treatment and to a lesser extent high salinity stress treatment. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmIMT</span> is functional in heterologous Arabidopsis plants.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important crop for oil and protein resources worldwide. The molecular mechanism of the abiotic stress response in soybean is largely unclear. We previously identified multiple stress-responsive WRKY genes from soybean. Here, we further characterized the roles of one of these genes, <span class="gene">GmWRKY27,</span> in abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> using a transgenic hairy root assay. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> expression was increased by various abiotic stresses. Over-expression and RNAi analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> improves salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Measurement of physiological parameters, including reactive oxygen species and proline contents, supported this conclusion. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> inhibits expression of a downstream gene <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> by binding to the W-boxes in its promoter region. The <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> is a negative factor of stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> as indicated by the performance of transgenic hairy roots under stress. <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> interacts with <span class="gene">GmMYB174,</span> which also suppresses <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> expression and enhances <span class="trait">drought</span> stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> The <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB174</span> may have evolved to bind to neighbouring cis elements in the <span class="gene">GmNAC29</span> promoter to co-reduce promoter activity and gene expression. Our study discloses a valuable mechanism in soybean for regulation of the stress response by two associated transcription factors. Manipulation of these genes should facilitate improvements in stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean and other crops.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is one of the most challenging agricultural issues limiting sustainable sugarcane production and, in some cases, <span class="trait">yield</span> losses caused by <span class="trait">drought</span> are nearly 50%. DREB proteins play vital regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. The transcription factor <span class="gene">DREB2A</span> interacts with a cis-acting DRE sequence to activate the expression of downstream genes that are involved in <span class="trait">drought-,</span> salt- and heat-stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of stress-inducible over-expression of AtDREB2A CA on gene expression, leaf water potential (ΨL), relative water content (RWC), sucrose content and gas exchanges of sugarcane plants submitted to a four-days water deficit treatment in a rhizotron-grown root system. The plants were also phenotyped by scanning the roots and measuring morphological parameters of the shoot. The stress-inducible expression of AtDREB2A CA in transgenic sugarcane led to the up-regulation of genes involved in plant response to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. The transgenic plants maintained higher RWC and ΨL over 4 days after withholding water and had higher photosynthetic rates until the 3rd day of water-deficit. Induced expression of AtDREB2A CA in sugarcane increased sucrose levels and improved bud sprouting of the transgenic plants. Our results indicate that induced expression of AtDREB2A CA in sugarcane enhanced its <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> without biomass penalty.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important crop around the world. Abiotic stress conditions, such as <span class="trait">drought</span> and heat, adversely affect its survival, growth, and production. The DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN2 (DREB2) group includes transcription factors that contribute to <span class="trait">drought</span> and heat stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> by activating transcription through the cis-element dehydration-responsive element (DRE) in response to these stress stimuli. Two modes of regulation, transcriptional and posttranslational, are important for the activation of gene expression by <span class="gene">DREB2A</span> in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, the regulatory system of <span class="gene">DREB2</span> in soybean is not clear. We identified a new soybean <span class="gene">DREB2</span> gene, <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2,</span> that was highly induced not only by dehydration and heat but also by low temperature. <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2</span> exhibited a high transactivation activity via DRE and has a serine/threonine-rich region, which corresponds to a negative regulatory domain of <span class="gene">DREB2A</span> that is involved in its posttranslational regulation, including destabilization. Despite the partial similarity between these sequences, the activity and stability of the <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2</span> protein were enhanced by removal of the serine/threonine-rich region in both Arabidopsis and soybean protoplasts, suggestive of a conserved regulatory mechanism that involves the recognition of serine/threonine-rich sequences with a specific pattern. The heterologous expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2</span> in Arabidopsis induced DRE-regulated stress-inducible genes and improved stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> However, there were variations in the growth phenotypes of the transgenic Arabidopsis, the induced genes, and their induction ratios between <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2</span> and DREB2A. Therefore, the basic function and regulatory machinery of <span class="gene">DREB2</span> have been maintained between Arabidopsis and soybean, although differentiation has also occurred.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean farming has faced several losses in productivity due to <span class="trait">drought</span> events in the last few decades. However, plants have molecular mechanisms to prevent and protect against water deficit injuries, and transcription factors play an important role in triggering different defense mechanisms. Understanding the expression patterns of transcription factors in response to water deficit and to environmental diurnal changes is very important for unveiling water deficit stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> mechanisms. Here, we analyzed the expression patterns of ten APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Element Binding-like (AP2/EREB-like) transcription factors in two soybean genotypes (BR16: drought-sensitive; and Embrapa 48: drought-tolerant). According to phylogenetic and domain analyses, these genes can be included in the DREB and ERF subfamilies. We also analyzed a <span class="gene">GmDRIP-like</span> gene that encodes a DREB negative regulator. We detected the up-regulation of 9 <span class="gene">GmAP2/EREB-like</span> genes and identified transcriptional differences that were dependent on the levels of the stress applied and the tissue type analyzed (the expression of the <span class="gene">GmDREB1F-like</span> gene, for example, was four times higher in roots than in leaves). The <span class="gene">GmDRIP-like</span> gene was not induced by water deficit in BR16 during the longest periods of stress, but was significantly induced in Embrapa 48; this suggests a possible genetic/molecular difference between the responses of these cultivars to water deficit stress. Additionally, RNAseq gene expression analysis over a 24-h time course indicates that the expression patterns of several <span class="gene">GmDREB-like</span> genes are subject to oscillation over the course of the day, indicating a possible circadian regulation.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> stress adversely affects [Glycine max (L.) Merr] soybean at most developmental stages, which collectively results in <span class="trait">yield</span> reduction. Little information is available on relative contribution and chromosomal locations of quantitative trait loci (QTL) conditioning <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean. A Japanese germplasm accession, PI 416937, was found to possess <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Under moisture-deficit conditions, PI 416937 wilted more slowly in the field than elite cultivars and has been used as a parent in breeding programs to improve soybean productivity. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was derived from a cross between PI 416937 and Benning, and the population was phenotyped for canopy wilting under rain-fed field conditions in five distinct environments to identify the QTL associated with the canopy-wilting trait. In a combined analysis over environments, seven QTL that explained 75 % of the variation in canopy-wilting trait were identified on different chromosomes, implying the complexity of this trait. Five QTL inherited their positive alleles from PI 416937. Surprisingly, the other two QTL inherited their positive alleles from Benning. These putative QTL were co-localized with other QTL previously identified as related to plant abiotic stresses in soybean, suggesting that canopy-wilting QTL may be associated with additional morpho-physiological traits in soybean. A locus on chromosome 12 <span class="gene">(Gm12)</span> from PI 416937 was detected in the combined analysis as well as in each individual environment, and explained 27 % of the variation in canopy-wilting. QTL identified in PI 416937 could provide an efficient means to augment field-oriented development of drought-tolerant soybean cultivars.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To gain insight into stress-responsive gene regulation in soybean plants, we identified consensus sequences that could categorize the transcription factors MYBJ7, BZIP50, C2H2, and <span class="gene">NAC2</span> as members of the gene families myb, bzip, c2h2, and nac, respectively. We also investigated the evolutionary relationship of these transcription factors and analyzed their expression levels under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. The NCBI software was used to find the predicted amino acid sequences of the transcription factors, and the Clustal X software was used to align soybean and other plant species sequences. Phylogenetic trees were built using the Mega 4.1 software by neighbor joining and the degree of confidence test by Bootstrap. Expression level studies were carried out using hydroponic culture; the experiments were designed in completely randomized blocks with three repetitions. The blocks consisted of two genotypes, MG/BR46 Conquista (drought-tolerant) and BR16 (drought-sensitive) and the treatments consisted of increasingly long dehydration periods (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 min). The transcription factors presented domains and/or conserved regions that characterized them as belonging to the bzip, c2h2, myb, and nac families. Based on the phylogenetic trees, it was found that the myb, bzip and nac genes are closely related to myb78, bzip48 and nac2 of soybean and that c2h2 is closely related to c2h2 of Brassica napus. Expression of all genes was in general increased under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress in both genotypes. Major differences between genotypes were due to the lowering of the expression of the mybj7 and c2h2 genes in the drought-tolerant variety at some times. Over-expression or silencing of some of these genes has the potential to increase stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In plants, the auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including development, growth, cell division and responses to environmental stimuli. An exhaustive search of soybean genome revealed 51 <span class="gene">GmARFs,</span> many of which were formed by genome duplications. The typical <span class="gene">GmARFs</span> (43 members) contain a DNA-binding domain, an ARF domain and an auxin/indole acetic acid (AUX/IAA) dimerization domain, whereas the remaining eight members lack the dimerization domain. Phylogenetic analysis of the ARFs from soybean and Arabidopsis revealed both similarity and divergence between the two ARF families, as well as enabled us to predict the functions of the <span class="gene">GmARFs.</span> Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and available soybean Affymetrix array and Illumina transcriptome sequence data, a comprehensive expression atlas of <span class="gene">GmARF</span> genes was obtained in various organs and tissues, providing useful information about their involvement in defining the precise nature of individual tissues. Furthermore, expression profiling using qRT-PCR and microarray data revealed many water stress-responsive <span class="gene">GmARFs</span> in soybean, albeit with different patterns depending on types of tissues and/or developmental stages. Our systematic analysis has identified excellent tissue-specific and/or stress-responsive candidate <span class="gene">GmARF</span> genes for in-depth in planta functional analyses, which would lead to potential applications in the development of genetically modified soybean cultivars with enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

						Plant LRR-RLKs serve as protein interaction platforms, and as regulatory modules of protein activation. Here, we report the isolation of a novel plant-specific <span class="gene">LRR-RLK</span> from Glycine soja (termed GsLRPK) by differential screening. GsLRPK expression was cold-inducible and shows Ser/Thr protein kinase activity. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that GsLRPK is localized in the plasma membrane. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that temperature, salt, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and ABA treatment can alter GsLRPK gene transcription in G. soja. However, just protein induced by cold stress not by salinity and ABA treatment in tobacco was found to possess kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of GsLRPK in yeast and Arabidopsis can enhance <span class="trait">resistance</span> to cold stress and increase the expression of a number of cold responsive gene markers.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Previous studies have shown that ubiquitination plays important roles in plant abiotic stress responses. In the present study, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme gene <span class="gene">GmUBC2,</span> a homologue of yeast RAD6, was cloned from soybean and functionally characterized. <span class="gene">GmUBC2</span> was expressed in all tissues in soybean and was up-regulated by <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt stress. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmUBC2</span> were more tolerant to salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses compared with the control plants. Through expression analyses of putative downstream genes in the transgenic plants, we found that the expression levels of two ion antiporter genes AtNHX1 and AtCLCa, a key gene involved in the biosynthesis of proline, AtP5CS, and the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase gene AtCCS, were all increased significantly in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmUBC2</span> is involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis, osmolyte synthesis, and oxidative stress responses. Our results also suggest that modulation of the ubiquitination pathway could be an effective means of improving salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in plants through genetic engineering.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						NAC transcription factors play important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. Previously, we identified multiple NAC genes in soybean (Glycine max). Here, we identify the roles of two genes, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> and <span class="gene">GmNAC20,</span> in stress responses and other processes. The two genes were differentially induced by multiple abiotic stresses and plant hormones, and their transcripts were abundant in roots and cotyledons. Both genes encoded proteins that localized to the nucleus and bound to the core DNA sequence CGT[G/A]. In the protoplast assay system, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> functions as a mild repressor; however, the C-terminal end of <span class="gene">GmANC20</span> has transcriptional activation activity. Over-expression of <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> enhances salt and freezing <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis plants; however, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> over-expression only improves salt <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Over-expression of <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> also promotes lateral root formation. <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> may regulate stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through activation of the DREB/CBF-COR pathway, and may control lateral root development by altering auxin signaling-related genes. <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> probably regulates DREB1A and other stress-related genes. The roles of the two <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes in stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> were further analyzed in soybean transgenic hairy roots. These results provide a basis for genetic manipulation to improve the agronomic traits of important crops.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> and heat are among the major abiotic stresses that affect soybean crops worldwide. During the current investigation, the effect of <span class="trait">drought,</span> heat, and <span class="trait">drought</span> plus heat stresses was compared in the leaves of two soybean varieties, Surge and Davison, combining 2D-DIGE proteomic data with physiology and biochemical analyses. We demonstrated how 25 differentially expressed photosynthesis-related proteins affect RuBisCO regulation, electron transport, Calvin cycle, and carbon fixation during <span class="trait">drought</span> and heat stress. We also observed higher abundance of heat stress-induced <span class="gene">EF-Tu</span> protein in Surge. It is possible that <span class="gene">EF-Tu</span> might have activated heat <span class="trait">tolerance</span> mechanisms in the soybean. Higher level expressions of heat shock-related protein seem to be regulating the heat <span class="trait">tolerance</span> mechanisms. This study identifies the differential expression of various abiotic stress-responsive proteins that regulate various molecular processes and signaling cascades. One inevitable outcome from the biochemical and proteomics assays of this study is that increase of ROS levels during <span class="trait">drought</span> stress does not show significant changes at the phenotypic level in Davison and this seems to be due to a higher amount of carbonic anhydrase accumulation in the cell which aids the cell to become more resistant to cytotoxic concentrations of H2O2.

						Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) play an essential role on the increased <span class="trait">tolerance</span> against heat stress by regulating the expression of heat-responsive genes. In this study, a genome-wide analysis was performed to identify all of the soybean (Glycine max) <span class="gene">GmHsf</span> genes based on the latest soybean genome sequence. Chromosomal location, protein domain, motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of 26 non-redundant <span class="gene">GmHsf</span> genes were analyzed compared with AtHsfs (Arabidopsis thaliana Hsfs). According to their structural features, the predicted members were divided into the previously defined classes A-C, as described for AtHsfs. Transcript levels and subcellular localization of five <span class="gene">GmHsfs</span> responsive to abiotic stresses were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. These results provide a fundamental clue for understanding the complexity of the soybean <span class="gene">GmHsf</span> gene family and cloning the functional genes in future studies.

						Plant acclimation to environmental stress is controlled by a complex network of regulatory genes that compose distinct stress-response regulons. The C2H2-type zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) have been implicated in different cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Through microarray analysis, an alkaline (NaHCO(3))-responsive ZFP gene GsZFP1 was identified and subsequently cloned from Glyycine soja. GsZFP1 encodes a 35.14 kDa protein with one C2H2-type zinc-finger motif. The QALGGH domain, conserved in most plant C2H2-type ZFPs, is absent in the GsZFP1 protein sequence. A subcellular localization study using a GFP fusion protein indicated that GsZFP1 is localized to the nucleus. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that GsZFP1 was induced in the leaf by ABA (100 μM), salt (200 mM NaCl), and cold (4°C), and in the root by ABA (100 μM), cold (4°C), and <span class="trait">drought</span> (30% PEG 6000). Over-expression of GsZFP1 in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in a greater <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to cold and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, a decreased water loss rate, and an increase in proline irrespective of environmental conditions. The over-expression of GsZFP1 also increased the expression of a number of stress-response marker genes, including CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, NCED3, COR47, and <span class="gene">RD29A</span> in response to cold stress and RAB18, NCED3, P5CS, RD22, and <span class="gene">RD29A</span> in response to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, especially early during stress treatments. Our studies suggest that GsZFP1 plays a crucial role in the plant response to cold and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> stress has long been a major constraint in maintaining <span class="trait">yield</span> stability of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in rainfed ecosystems. The identification of consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) involving seed <span class="trait">yield</span> per plant (YP) and <span class="trait">drought</span> susceptibility index (DSI) in a population across different environments would therefore be important in molecular marker-assisted breeding of soybean cultivars suitable for rainfed regions. The YP of a recombinant line population of 184 F(2:7:11) lines from a cross of Kefeng1 and Nannong1138-2 was studied under water-stressed (WS) and well-watered (WW) conditions in field (F) and greenhouse (G) trials, and DSI for <span class="trait">yield</span> was calculated in two trials. Nineteen QTLs associated with YP-WS and YP-WW, and 10 QTLs associated with DSI, were identified. Comparison of these QTL locations with previous findings showed that the majority of these regions control one or more traits related to <span class="trait">yield</span> and other agronomic traits. One QTL on molecular linkage group (MLG) K for YP-F, and two QTLs on MLG <span class="gene">C2</span> for YP-G, remained constant across different water regimes. The regions on MLG <span class="gene">C2</span> for YP-WW-F and MLG H for YP-WS-F had a pleiotropic effect on DSI-F, and MLG A1 for YP-WS-G had a pleiotropic effect on DSI-G. The identification of consistent QTLs for YP and DSI across different environments will significantly improve the efficiency of selecting for <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The study of <span class="trait">tolerance</span> mechanisms for <span class="trait">drought</span> stress in soybean is fundamental to the understanding and development of tolerant varieties. Using in silico analysis, four marker genes involved in the classical ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways of <span class="trait">drought</span> response were identified in the Glycine max genome in the present work. The expression profiles of the marker genes ERD1-like, <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A-like,</span> <span class="gene">GmaxRD22-like</span> and <span class="gene">GmaxRD29B-like</span> were investigated by qPCR in root samples of <span class="trait">drought</span> sensitive and tolerant soybean cultivars (BR 16 and Embrapa 48, respectively), submitted to water deficit conditions in hydroponic and pot-based systems. Among the four putative soybean homologs to Arabidopsis genes investigated herein, only <span class="gene">GmaxRD29B-like</span> was not regulated by water deficit stress. Distinct expression profiles and different induction levels were observed among the genes, as well as between the two drought-inducing systems. Our results showed contrasting gene expression responses for the <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A-like</span> and <span class="gene">GmaxRD22-like</span> genes. <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A-like</span> was highly induced by continuous <span class="trait">drought</span> acclimating conditions, whereas <span class="gene">GmaxRD22-like</span> responses decreased after abrupt water deprivation. <span class="gene">GmaxERD1-like</span> showed a different expression profile for the cultivars in each system. Conversely, <span class="gene">GmaxRD20A-like</span> and <span class="gene">GmaxRD22-like</span> genes exhibited similar expression levels in tolerant plants in both systems.

						The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors plays an important role in the growth and developmental process as well as responds to various abiotic stresses, such as <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salinity. Our previous work identified <span class="gene">GmFDL19,</span> a bZIP transcription factor, as a flowering promoter in soybean, and the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> caused early flowering in transgenic soybean plants. Here, we report that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> also enhances <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt stress in soybean. <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> was determined to be a group A member, and its transcription expression was highly induced by abscisic acid (ABA), polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) and high salt stresses. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> in soybean enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> at the seedling stage. The relative plant height (RPH) and relative shoot dry weight (RSDW) of transgenic plants were significantly higher than those of the WT after PEG and salt treatments. In addition, the germination rate and plant height of the transgenic soybean were also significantly higher than that of WT plants after various salt treatments. Furthermore, we also found that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> could reduce the accumulation of Na+ ion content and up-regulate the expression of several ABA/stress-responsive genes in transgenic soybean. We also found that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> overexpression increased the activities of several antioxidative enzyme and chlorophyll content but reduced malondialdehyde content. These results suggested that <span class="gene">GmFDL19</span> is involved in soybean abiotic stress responses and has potential utilization to improve multiple stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in transgenic soybean.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is a significant constraint to <span class="trait">yield</span> increase in soybean. The early perception of water deprivation is critical for recruitment of genes that promote plant <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> DeepSuperSAGE libraries, including one control and a bulk of six stress times imposed (from 25 to 150 min of root dehydration) for drought-tolerant and sensitive soybean accessions, allowed to identify new molecular targets for <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> The survey uncovered 120,770 unique transcripts expressed by the contrasting accessions. Of these, 57,610 aligned with known cDNA sequences, allowing the annotation of 32,373 unitags. A total of 1,127 unitags were up-regulated only in the tolerant accession, whereas 1,557 were up-regulated in both as compared to their controls. An expression profile concerning the most representative Gene Ontology (GO) categories for the tolerant accession revealed the expression "protein binding" as the most represented for "Molecular Function", whereas <span class="gene">CDPK</span> and CBL were the most up-regulated protein families in this category. Furthermore, particular genes expressed different isoforms according to the accession, showing the potential to operate in the distinction of physiological behaviors. Besides, heat maps comprising GO categories related to abiotic stress response and the unitags regulation observed in the expression contrasts covering tolerant and sensitive accessions, revealed the unitags potential for plant breeding. Candidate genes related to "hormone response" (LOX, ERF1b, XET), "water response" (PUB, BMY), "salt stress response" (WRKY, MYB) and "oxidative stress response" (PER) figured among the most promising molecular targets. Additionally, nine transcripts (HMGR, XET, WRKY20, RAP2-4, EREBP, NAC3, PER, GPX5 and BMY) validated by RT-qPCR (four different time points) confirmed their differential expression and pointed that already after 25 minutes a transcriptional reorganization started in response to the new condition, with important differences between both accessions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], caused by Phytophthora sojae Kaufmann and Gerdemann, is a destructive disease throughout the soybean planting regions in the world. Here, we report insights into the function and underlying mechanisms of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) in soybean, namely <span class="gene">GmERF5,</span> in host responses to P. sojae. <span class="gene">GmERF5-overexpressing</span> transgenic soybean exhibited significantly enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> to P. sojae and positively regulated the expression of the PR10, PR1-1, and PR10-1 genes. Sequence analysis suggested that <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> contains an AP2/ERF domain of 58 aa and a conserved ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif in its C-terminal region. Following stress treatments, <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> was significantly induced by P. sojae, ethylene (ET), abscisic acid (ABA), and salicylic acid (SA). The activity of the <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> promoter <span class="gene">(GmERF5P)</span> was upregulated in tobacco leaves with ET, ABA, Phytophthora nicotianae, salt, and <span class="trait">drought</span> treatments, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> could be involved not only in the induced defence response but also in the ABA-mediated pathway of salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> could bind to the GCC-box element and act as a repressor of gene transcription. It was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> interacted with a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor <span class="gene">(GmbHLH)</span> and eukaryotic translation initiation factor <span class="gene">(GmEIF)</span> both in yeast cells and in planta. To the best of our knowledge, <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> is the first soybean EAR motif-containing ERF transcription factor demonstrated to be involved in the response to pathogen infection.

						A new member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, <span class="gene">GmERF3,</span> was isolated from soybean. Sequence analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> contained an AP2/ERF domain of 58 amino acids and two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains. It belonged to a group IV protein in the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily as typified by a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. Expression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> was induced by treatments with high salinity, <span class="trait">drought,</span> abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV), whereas there was no significant <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> mRNA accumulation under cold stress treatment. <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> could bind to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element, and was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> protein fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast. Ectopic expression of the <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> gene in transgenic tobacco plants induced the expression of some PR genes and enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> against infection by Ralstonia solanacearum, Alternaria alternata, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and gave <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to high salinity and dehydration stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> in transgenic tobacco led to higher levels of free proline and soluble carbohydrates compared to wild-type plants under <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. The overall results suggested that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> as an AP2/ERF transcription factor may play dual roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MYB, v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog, proteins play central roles in plant stress response. Previously, we identified a novel R2R3-MYB transcription factor, <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2,</span> which affected the expression levels of some key enzyme genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in transgenic Arabidopsis. In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> under salt, low temperature, <span class="trait">drought,</span> abscisic acid (ABA), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation treatments in soybean using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> was drastically induced by UV irradiation and salt treatment, but no response was detected under low temperature, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and ABA stresses. A detailed characterization of the <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> overexpression lines revealed that <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> might be involved in response of plants to UV radiation and salt stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> showed an increased <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salt and UV radiation treatment compared with wild-type plants. The expression levels of certain salt stress-responsive genes, such as <span class="gene">DREB2A</span> and RD17, were found to be elevated in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> acts as a regulator in the plant stress response.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Trihelix transcription factors play important roles in light-regulated responses and other developmental processes. However, their functions in abiotic stress response are largely unclear. In this study, we identified two trihelix transcription factor genes <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> from soybean and further characterized their roles in abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> FINDINGS: Both genes can be induced by various abiotic stresses, and the encoded proteins were localized in nuclear region. In yeast assay, <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> but not <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> exhibits ability of transcriptional activation and dimerization. The N-terminal peptide of 153 residues in <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> was the minimal activation domain and the middle region between the two trihelices mediated the dimerization of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2B.</span> Transactivation activity of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> was also confirmed in plant cells. DNA binding analysis using yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> could bind to GT-1bx, GT-2bx, mGT-2bx-2 and D1 whereas <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> could bind to the latter three elements. Overexpression of the <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> improved plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salt, freezing and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmGT-2B-transgenic</span> plants had more green seedlings compared to Col-0 under ABA treatment. Many stress-responsive genes were altered in <span class="gene">GmGT-2A-</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B-transgenic</span> plants. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmGT-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> confer stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through regulation of a common set of genes and specific sets of genes. <span class="gene">GmGT-2B</span> also affects ABA sensitivity.

						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is detrimental to plant growth and development, and often results in significant losses to the yields of economically important crops such as soybeans (Glycine max L.). NAC transcription factors (TFs), which consist of a large family of plant-specific TFs, have been reported to enhance <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in a number of plants. In this study, 31 unigenes that contain the complete open reading frames encoding <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins were identified and cloned from soybean. Analysis of C-terminal regulatory domain using yeast one-hybrid system indicated that among 31 <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins, 28 have transcriptional activation activity. Expression analysis of these <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes showed that they are differentially expressed in different organs, suggesting that they have diverse functions during plant growth and development. To search for the drought-inducible <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes, we prescreened and re-confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis that nine <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes are induced by dehydration stress with differential induction levels in both shoot and root. The expression profiles of these nine <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes were also examined under other stresses such as high salinity, cold and with abscisic acid hormone treatments. Phylogenetic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins with previously reported drought-inducible NAC proteins of Arabidopsis and rice revealed that the nine drought-inducible <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins belong to the "stress-inducible" NAC group. The results of this systematic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> family will provide novel tools and resources for the development of improved <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerant transgenic soybean cultivars.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) is a subfamily of the aquaporin (AQP), also known as major intrinsic protein (MIP) family, and regulates water movement across vacuolar membranes. Some reports have implied that <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes are associated with plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to some abiotic stresses that cause water loss, such as <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salinity. In our previous work, we found that an expressed sequence tag (EST) representing a <span class="gene">TIP</span> gene in our Glycine soja EST library was inducible by abiotic stresses. This <span class="gene">TIP</span> was subsequently isolated from G. soja with cDNA library screening, EST assembly and PCR, and named as GsTIP2;1. The expression patterns of GsTIP2;1 in G. soja under low temperature, salt and dehydration stress were different in leaves and roots. Though GsTIP2;1 is a stress-induced gene, overexpression of GsTIP2;1 in Arabidopsis thaliana depressed <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salt and dehydration stress, but did not affect seedling growth under cold or favorable conditions. Higher dehydration speed was detected in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GsTIP2;1, implying GsTIP2;1 might mediate stress sensitivity by enhancing water loss in the plant. Such a result is not identical to previous reports, providing some new information about the relationship between <span class="gene">TIP</span> and plant abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> monooxygenases (P450s) represent a large and important enzyme superfamily in plants. They catalyze numerous monooxygenation/hydroxylation reactions in biochemical pathways, P450s are involved in a variety of metabolic pathways and participate in the homeostasis of phytohormones. The CYP82 family genes specifically reside in dicots and are usually induced by distinct environmental stresses. However, their functions are largely unknown, especially in soybean (Glycine max L.). Here, we report the function of <span class="gene">GmCYP82A3,</span> a gene from soybean CYP82 family. Its expression was induced by Phytophthora sojae infection, salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or ethephon (ETH). Its expression levels were consistently high in resistant cultivars. Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmCYP82A3</span> exhibited strong <span class="trait">resistance</span> to Botrytis cinerea and Phytophthora parasitica, and enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses. Furthermore, transgenic plants were less sensitive to jasmonic acid (JA), and the enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> was accompanied with increased expression of the JA/ET signaling pathway-related genes.

						Plants respond to cold stress by modifying the expression of a battery of cold-responsive genes. Using cDNA-AFLP techniques, <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> (G lycine m ax chilling-inducible) (accession no. EU699765) was isolated from the embryonic axis of a chilling-resistant cultivar of soybean seed imbibed at 4 degrees C for 24 h. The full-length <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> cDNA which consisted of a single open reading frame (ORF) encoded a putative polypeptide of 129 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed neither significant similarity of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> to known proteins, nor any conserved domains found. Soybean seed imbibed at 4 degrees C dramatically enhanced transcript level of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> after 1 h, and reached a maximum at 18 h, while the expression was only detected in the embryonic axis. <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> expression was strongly induced by treatment with ABA and PEG, but weakly by 250 mM NaCl which suggests that <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> is probably regulated by ABA-dependent signal transduction pathway during cold acclimation. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> in Arabidopsis under the control of CaMV35S promoter enhanced the <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to cold, <span class="trait">drought</span> and NaCl stresses. Therefore, <span class="gene">GMCHI</span> may play an important role in the adaptation of chilling-resistant soybean seed to chilling imbibition.

						Abiotic stresses, including high soil salinity, significantly reduce crop production worldwide. Salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in plants is a complex trait and is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms and dissecting the components on their regulatory pathways will provide new insights, leading to novel strategies for the improvement of salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in agricultural and economic crops of importance. Here we report that soybean salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> 1, named <span class="gene">GmST1,</span> exhibited strong <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salt stress in the Arabidopsis transgenic lines. The <span class="gene">GmST1-overexpressed</span> Arabidopsis also increased sensitivity to ABA and decreased production of reactive oxygen species under salt stress. In addition, <span class="gene">GmST1</span> significantly improved <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in Arabidopsis transgenic lines. <span class="gene">GmST1</span> belongs to a 3-prime part of <span class="gene">Glyma.03g171600</span> gene in the current version of soybean genome sequence annotation. However, comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis around <span class="gene">Glyma.03g171600</span> genomic region confirmed that <span class="gene">GmST1</span> might serve as an intact gene in soybean leaf tissues. Unlike <span class="gene">Glyma.03g171600</span> which was not expressed in leaves, <span class="gene">GmST1</span> was strongly induced by salt treatment in the leaf tissues. By promoter analysis, a TATA box was detected to be positioned close to <span class="gene">GmST1</span> start codon and a putative ABRE and a DRE cis-acting elements were identified at about 1 kb upstream of <span class="gene">GmST1</span> gene. The data also indicated that <span class="gene">GmST1-transgenic</span> lines survived under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and showed a significantly lower water loss than non-transgenic lines. In summary, our results suggest that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmST1</span> significantly improves Arabidopsis <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to both salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses and the gene may be a potential candidate for genetic engineering of salt- and drought-tolerant crops.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: The NAC gene family is notable due to its large size, as well as its relevance in crop cultivation - particularly in terms of enhancing stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of plants. These plant-specific proteins contain NAC domain(s) that are named after Petunia NAM and Arabidopsis ATAF1/2 and CUC2 transcription factors based on the consensus sequence they have. Despite the knowledge available regarding NAC protein function, an extensive study on the possible use of <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> in developing soybean cultivars with superior <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> is yet to be done. RESULTS: In response to this, our study was carried out, mainly through means of phylogenetic analysis (rice and Arabidopsis NAC genes served as seeding sequences). Through this, 139 <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes were identified and later grouped into 17 clusters. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on drought-stressed and unstressed leaf tissues of both sensitive (B217 and H228) and tolerant (Jindou 74 and 78) cultivars. This was done to analyze the gene expression of 28 dehydration-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes. Upon completing the analysis, it was found that <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> gene expression is actually dependent on genotype. Eight of the 28 selected genes <span class="gene">(GmNAC004,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC021,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC065,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC066,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC073,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC082,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC083</span> and <span class="gene">GmNAC087)</span> were discovered to have high expression levels in the drought-resistant soybean varieties tested. This holds true for both extreme and standard <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Alternatively, the drought-sensitive cultivars exhibited lower <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> expression levels in comparison to their tolerant counterparts. CONCLUSION: The study allowed for the identification of eight <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes that could be focused upon in future attempts to develop superior soybean varieties, particularly in terms of <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance.</span> This study revealed that there were more dehydration-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes as <span class="gene">(GmNAC004,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC005,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC020</span> and <span class="gene">GmNAC021)</span> in addition to what were reported in earlier inquiries. It is important to note though, that discovering such notable genes is not the only goal of the study. It managed to put emphasis on the significance of further understanding the potential of soybean <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes, for the purpose of enhancing <span class="trait">tolerance</span> towards abiotic stress in general. This scientific inquiry has also revealed that cultivar genotypes tend to differ in their drought-induced gene expression.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Glyoxalase pathway consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) which detoxifies a highly cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) to its non-toxic form. MG may form advanced glycation end products with various cellular macro-molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA; that ultimately lead to their inactivation. Role of glyoxalase enzymes has been extensively investigated in various plant species which showed their crucial role in salinity, <span class="trait">drought</span> and heavy metal stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Previously genome-wide analysis of glyoxalase genes has been conducted in model plants Arabidopsis and rice, but no such study was performed in any legume species. RESULTS: In the present study, a comprehensive genome database analysis of soybean was performed and identified a total of putative 41 GLYI and 23 GLYII proteins encoded by 24 and 12 genes, respectively. Detailed analysis of these identified members was conducted including their nomenclature and classification, chromosomal distribution and duplication, exon-intron organization, and protein domain(s) and motifs identification. Expression profiling of these genes has been performed in different tissues and developmental stages as well as under salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses using publicly available RNAseq and microarray data. The study revealed that <span class="gene">GmGLYI-7</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII-8</span> have been expressed intensively in all the developmental stages and tissues; while <span class="gene">GmGLYI-6,</span> <span class="gene">GmGLYI-9,</span> <span class="gene">GmGLYI-20,</span> <span class="gene">GmGLYII-5</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII-10</span> were highly abiotic stress responsive members. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies the largest family of glyoxalase proteins to date with 41 <span class="gene">GmGLYI</span> and 23 <span class="gene">GmGLYII</span> members in soybean. Detailed analysis of <span class="gene">GmGLYI</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII</span> genes strongly indicates the genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication of the glyoxalase members. Moreover, this study provides a strong basis about the biological role and function of <span class="gene">GmGLYI</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII</span> members in soybean growth, development and stress physiology.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A novel DREB (dehydration responsive element binding protein) homologous gene, <span class="gene">GmDREB2,</span> was isolated from soybean. Based on its similarity with <span class="gene">AP2</span> domains, <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> was classified into A-5 subgroup in DREB subfamily in AP2/EREBP family. Expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> gene was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> high salt, and low temperature stresses and abscisic acid treatment. The <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> bound specifically to DRE element in vitro. Furthermore, the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> activated expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> and high-salt stresses and did not cause growth retardation. Analysis of free proline contents in transgenic tobacco indicated that the overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> accumulated higher level of free proline compared to the wild type plants under <span class="trait">drought</span> condition. The results from this study indicate that this novel soybean <span class="gene">GmDREB2</span> gene functions as an important transcriptional activator and may be useful in improving of plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to abiotic stresses in plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant response to environmental stresses is regulated by a complicated network of regulatory and functional genes. In this study, we isolated the putative stress-associated gene <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> (a C2H2-type Zinc finger protein gene) based on the previous finding that it was one of two genes located in the QTL region between the Satt590 and Satt567 markers related to soybean <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought.</span> Temporal and spatial expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> was primarily expressed in roots, stems and leaf organs and was expressed at low levels in flowers and soybean pods. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> expression increased in response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. In addition, subcellular localization analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> was ubiquitously distributed in plant cells. Transgenic experiments indicated that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> played a negative role in plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought.</span> Analysis of ABA-related marker gene expression in Arabidopsis suggested that <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> might be involved in the ABA-dependent pathway during the <span class="trait">drought</span> stress response. Taken together, these results suggest that soybean <span class="gene">GmZFP3</span> negatively regulates the <span class="trait">drought</span> response.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is a major threat to global soybean production. The limited transformation potential and polyploid nature of soybean have hindered functional analysis of soybean genes. Previous research has implicated farnesylation in the plant's response to abscisic acid (ABA) and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> We therefore used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to evaluate farnesyltransferase genes, <span class="gene">GmERA1A</span> and <span class="gene">GmERA1B</span> (Glycine max Enhanced Response to ABA1-A and -B), as potential targets for increasing <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> in soybean. Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV)-mediated <span class="gene">GmERA1-down-regulated</span> soybean leaves displayed an enhanced stomatal response to ABA and reduced water loss and wilting under dehydration conditions, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmERA1A</span> and <span class="gene">GmERA1B</span> negatively regulate ABA signaling in soybean guard cells. The findings provide evidence that the ALSV-VIGS system, which bypasses the need to generate transgenic plants, is a useful tool for analyzing gene function using only a single down-regulated leaf. Thus, the ALSV-VIGS system could constitute part of a next-generation molecular breeding pipeline to accelerate <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> breeding in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) are basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factors that bind to the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) in the promoter regions of ABA-inducible genes in plants. A novel bZIP transcription factor gene, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1,</span> encoding 438 amino acids with a conserved bZIP domain composed of 60 amino acids was isolated from salt-tolerant soybean cv. Tiefeng 8. Southern blotting showed that only one copy was present in the soybean genome. Phylogenetic analyses showed that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> belonged to the AREB subfamily of the bZIP family and was most closely related to AtABF2 and OsTRAB1. The expression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was highly induced by ABA, <span class="trait">drought,</span> high salt and low temperature; and <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was expressed in soybean roots, stems and leaves under different stress conditions. <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was localized inside the nuclei of transformed onion epidermal cells. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> enhanced the responses of transgenic plants to ABA and triggered stomatal closure under stresses, potentially leading to improved tolerances to several abiotic stresses such as high salt, low temperature and <span class="trait">drought</span> in transgenic plants. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> affected the expression of some ABA or stress-related genes involved in regulating stomatal closure in Arabidopsis under ABA, <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salt stress conditions. A few AREB elements were detected in the promoter region of those ABA or stress-related genes, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> regulates the ABA response or stomatal closure mediated by those downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was used to improve the <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> trait of Chinese wheat varieties BS93. Functional analysis showed that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> enhanced the <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of transgenic wheat, and transcripts of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> were detected in transgenic wheat using RT-PCR. In addition, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> overexpression did not result in growth retardation in all transgenic plants, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> may be a valuable genetic resource for engineering stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of crops.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is one of the most important crops for oil and protein resource. Improvement of stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> will be beneficial for soybean seed production. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Six <span class="gene">GmPHD</span> genes encoding Alfin1-type PHD finger protein were identified and their expressions differentially responded to <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt, cold and ABA treatments. The six <span class="gene">GmPHDs</span> were nuclear proteins and showed ability to bind the cis-element "GTGGAG". The N-terminal domain of <span class="gene">GmPHD</span> played a major role in DNA binding. Using a protoplast assay system, we find that <span class="gene">GmPHD1</span> to <span class="gene">GmPHD5</span> had transcriptional suppression activity whereas <span class="gene">GmPHD6</span> did not have. In yeast assay, the <span class="gene">GmPHD6</span> can form homodimer and heterodimer with the other <span class="gene">GmPHDs</span> except <span class="gene">GmPHD2.</span> The N-terminal plus the variable regions but not the PHD-finger is required for the dimerization. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the <span class="gene">GmPHD2</span> showed salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> when compared with the wild type plants. This <span class="trait">tolerance</span> was likely achieved by diminishing the oxidative stress through regulation of downstream genes. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide important clues for soybean stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through manipulation of PHD-type transcription regulator.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Despite extensive studies in eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases, functional information about the ALDH7 antiquitin-like proteins is lacking. A soybean antiquitin homologue gene, designated <span class="gene">GmTP55,</span> has been isolated which encodes a dehydrogenase motif-containing 55 kDa protein induced by dehydration and salt stress. <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> is closely related to the stress-induced plant antiquitin-like proteins that belong to the ALDH7 family. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants constitutively expressing <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> have been obtained in order to examine the physiological role of this enzyme under a variety of stress conditions. Ectopic expression of <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> in both Arabidopsis and tobacco conferred <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salinity during germination and to water deficit during plant growth. Under salt stress, the germination efficiency of both transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis seeds was significantly higher than that of their control counterparts. Likewise, under progressive <span class="trait">drought,</span> the transgenic tobacco lines apparently kept the shoot turgidity to a normal level, which contrasted with the leaf wilt phenotype of control plants. The transgenic plants also exhibited an enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to H(2)O(2)- and paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Both <span class="gene">GmTP55-expressing</span> Arabidopsis and tobacco seeds germinated efficiently in medium supplemented with H(2)O(2), whereas the germination of control seeds was drastically impaired. Similarly, transgenic tobacco leaf discs treated with paraquat displayed a significant reduction in the necrotic lesions as compared with control leaves. These transgenic lines also exhibited a lower concentration of lipid peroxidation-derived reactive aldehydes under oxidative stress. These results suggest that antiquitin may be involved in adaptive responses mediated by a physiologically relevant detoxification pathway in plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						WRKY-type transcription factors have multiple roles in the plant defence response and developmental processes. Their roles in the abiotic stress response remain obscure. In this study, 64 <span class="gene">GmWRKY</span> genes from soybean were identified, and were found to be differentially expressed under abiotic stresses. Nine <span class="gene">GmWRKY</span> proteins were tested for their transcription activation in the yeast assay system, and five showed such ability. In a DNA-binding assay, three proteins <span class="gene">(GmWRKY13,</span> <span class="gene">GmWRKY27</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY54)</span> with a conserved WRKYGQK sequence in their DNA-binding domain could bind to the W-box (TTGAC). However, <span class="gene">GmWRKY6</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY21,</span> with an altered sequence WRKYGKK, lost the ability to bind to the W-box. The function of three stress-induced genes, <span class="gene">GmWRKY13,</span> <span class="gene">GmWRKY21</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY54,</span> was further investigated using a transgenic approach. <span class="gene">GmWRKY21-transgenic</span> Arabidopsis plants were tolerant to cold stress, whereas <span class="gene">GmWRKY54</span> conferred salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance,</span> possibly through the regulation of <span class="gene">DREB2A</span> and STZ/Zat10. Transgenic plants over-expressing <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span> showed increased sensitivity to salt and mannitol stress, but decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid, when compared with wild-type plants. In addition, <span class="gene">GmWRKY13-transgenic</span> plants showed an increase in lateral roots. These results indicate that the three <span class="gene">GmWRKY</span> genes play differential roles in abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance,</span> and that <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span> may function in both lateral root development and the abiotic stress response.

						Soybean, one of the most important crops worldwide, is severely affected by abiotic stress. <span class="trait">Drought</span> and flooding are the major abiotic stresses impacting soybean <span class="trait">yield.</span> In this regard, understanding water uptake by plants, its utilization and transport has great importance. In plants, water transport is mainly governed by channel forming aquaporin proteins (AQPs). Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) belong to the plant-specific AQP subfamily and are known to have a role in abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> In this study, 23 soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes were identified based on the latest soybean genome annotation. TIPs were characterized based on conserved structural features and phylogenetic distribution. Expression analysis of soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes in various tissues and under abiotic stress conditions demonstrated tissue/stress-response specific differential expression. The natural variations for <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes were analyzed using whole genome re-sequencing data available for a set of 106 diverse soybean genotypes including wild types, landraces and elite lines. Results revealed 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and several large insertions/deletions in the coding region of TIPs. Among these, non-synonymous SNPs are most likely to have a greater impact on protein function and are candidates for molecular studies as well as for the development of functional markers to assist breeding. The solute transport function of two TIPs was further validated by expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. <span class="gene">GmTIP1;5</span> was shown to facilitate the rapid movement of water across the oocyte membrane, while <span class="gene">GmTIP2;5</span> facilitated the movement of water and boric acid. The present study provides an initial insight into the possible roles of soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes under abiotic stress conditions. Our results will facilitate elucidation of their precise functions during abiotic stress responses and plant development, and will provide potential breeding targets for modifying water movement in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Although the discovery of aquaporins in plants has resulted in a paradigm shift in the understanding of plant water relations, the relationship between aquaporins and plant responses to <span class="trait">drought</span> still remains elusive. Moreover, the contribution of aquaporin genes to the enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> in arbuscular mycorrhisal (AM) plants has never been investigated. Therefore, we studied, at a molecular level, whether the expression of aquaporin-encoding genes in roots is altered by the AM symbiosis as a mechanism to enhance host plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to water deficit. In this study, genes encoding plasma membrane aquaporins (PIPs) from soybean and lettuce were cloned and their expression pattern studied in AM and nonAM plants cultivated under well-watered or <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed conditions. Results showed that AM plants responded to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress by down-regulating the expression of the <span class="gene">PIP</span> genes studied and anticipating its down-regulation as compared to nonAM plants. The possible physiological implications of this down-regulation of <span class="gene">PIP</span> genes as a mechanism to decrease membrane water permeability and to allow cellular water conservation is further discussed.

						Transcriptional repressors are emerging as central regulators of development and stress responses in different organisms. The ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif was identified as essential for transcriptional repression. To gain a better understanding of this type of protein, we reported here a novel <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein from soybean. Sequence alignment showed that <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> contains one AP2/ERF domain, two putative nuclear localization signal regions and one EAR motif. The <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein was preferentially localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells and bound specifically to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> was induced by ethylene, JA, SA, cold, salt, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and soybean mosaic virus, and repressed by ABA. Constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> in transgenic tobacco plants increased <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses compared with wild-type plants, but did not exhibit detectable <span class="trait">resistance</span> against bacterial infection.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean is a major source of oil and protein in the human diet and in animal feed. However, as soybean is deficient in sulfur-containing amino acids, its nutritional value is limited. Increasing sulfate assimilation and utilization efficiency is a valuable approach to augment the concentration of sulfur-containing amino acids in soybean seeds, and sulfate transporters play important roles in both sulfate uptake and translocation within plants. RESULTS: In this study, we isolated and characterized a soybean sulfate transporter gene: <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b.</span> The gene was found to be specifically expressed in root tissues and induced by low-sulfur stress. In addition, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> expression in yeast could complement deficiency in the sulfate transporter genes SUL1 and SUL2. Under +S conditions, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> tobacco plants accumulated higher levels of organic matter and exhibited enhanced biomass and seed weight compared to control plants. Under -S conditions, acclimation of <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> plants was much better than control plants. <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b-overexpressing</span> tobacco seedlings showed better <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress than the control plants, but no significant difference was observed under salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed 515 genes with at least a 2-fold change in expression in the leaves of tobacco plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b.</span> Of these, 227 gene annotations were classified into 12 functional categories associated with 123 relevant pathways, including biosynthesis and metabolism-related proteins, stress-related proteins, and transporters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported here indicate that the increased biomass and seed <span class="trait">yield</span> observed in transgenic tobacco plants could have resulted from greater nutrient uptake and transport capability as well as enhanced development and accumulation of organic matter. Taken together, our results indicate that <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> plays an important role in sulfur uptake and could alter the sulfur status of plants. Our study suggests that overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> may enhance plant <span class="trait">yield</span> under +S conditions, reduce plant production loss under -S conditions, and improve plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to sulfur deficiency stress.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						There is an increasing global concern about the availability of water for agricultural use. <span class="trait">Drought</span> stress negatively impacts plant physiology and crop productivity. Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the important oilseed crops, and its productivity is often reduced by <span class="trait">drought.</span> In this study, a commercial extract of Ascophyllum nodosum (ANE) was evaluated for its potential to alleviate <span class="trait">drought</span> stress in soybean. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ANE on the response of soybean plants to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress by monitoring stomatal conductance, relative leaf water content, antioxidant activity and expression of stress-responsive genes. Plants treated with ANE had higher relative water content and higher stomatal conductance under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. During early recovery in the post-drought phase, ANE treated plants had significantly higher stomatal conductance. The antioxidant activity was also found higher in the plants treated with ANE. In addition, ANE-treatment led to changes in the expression of stress-responsive genes: <span class="gene">GmCYP707A1a,</span> <span class="gene">GmCYP707A3b,</span> <span class="gene">GmRD22,</span> <span class="gene">GmRD20,</span> <span class="gene">GmDREB1B,</span> <span class="gene">GmERD1,</span> <span class="gene">GmNFYA3,</span> FIB1a, <span class="gene">GmPIP1b,</span> <span class="gene">GmGST,</span> <span class="gene">GmBIP</span> and <span class="gene">GmTp55.</span> Taken together, these results suggest that applications of ANE improve the <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of soybean by changing physiology and gene expression.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MYB-type transcription factors contain the conserved MYB DNA-binding domain of approximately 50 amino acids and are involved in the regulation of many aspects of plant growth, development, metabolism and stress responses. From soybean plants, we identified 156 <span class="gene">GmMYB</span> genes using our previously obtained 206 MYB unigenes, and 48 were found to have full-length open-reading frames. Expressions of all these identified genes were examined, and we found that expressions of 43 genes were changed upon treatment with ABA, salt, <span class="trait">drought</span> and/or cold stress. Three <span class="gene">GmMYB</span> genes, <span class="gene">GmMYB76,</span> <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB177,</span> were chosen for further analysis. Using the yeast assay system, <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span> and <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> were found to have transactivation activity and can form homodimers. <span class="gene">GmMYB177</span> did not appear to have transactivation activity but can form heterodimers with <span class="gene">GmMYB76.</span> Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that all the three <span class="gene">GmMYBs</span> could bind to cis-elements TAT AAC GGT TTT TT and CCG GAA <span class="gene">AAA</span> AGG AT, but with different affinity, and <span class="gene">GmMYB92</span> could also bind to TCT CAC CTA CC. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmMYB76</span> or <span class="gene">GmMYB177</span> showed better performance than the <span class="gene">GmMYB92-transgenic</span> plants in salt and freezing <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> However, these transgenic plants exhibited reduced sensitivity to ABA treatment at germination stage in comparison with the wild-type plants. The three <span class="gene">GmMYB</span> genes differentially affected a subset of stress-responsive genes in addition to their regulation of a common subset of stress-responsive genes. These results indicate that the three <span class="gene">GmMYB</span> genes may play differential roles in stress <span class="trait">tolerance,</span> possibly through regulation of stress-responsive genes.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant <span class="gene">Snf1</span> (sucrose non-fermenting-1) related protein kinase (SnRK), a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases, has been implicated as a crucial upstream regulator of ABA and osmotic signaling as in many other signaling cascades. In this paper, we have isolated a novel plant specific ABA activated calcium independent protein kinase (GsAPK) from a highly salt tolerant plant, Glycine soja (50109), which is a member of the SnRK2 family. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that GsAPK is localized in the plasma membrane. We found that autophosphorylation and Myelin Basis Protein phosphorylation activity of GsAPK is only activated by ABA and the kinase activity also was observed when calcium was replaced by EGTA, suggesting its independence of calcium in enzyme activity. We also found that cold, salinity, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and ABA stress alter GsAPK gene transcripts and heterogonous overexpression of GsAPK in Arabidopsis alters plant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to high salinity and ABA stress. In summary, we demonstrated that GsAPK is a Glycine soja ABA activated calcium independent SnRK-type kinase presumably involved in ABA mediated stress signal transduction.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Drought</span> is today, and perhaps even more in the future, the main challenge for grain crops, resulting in a drastic <span class="trait">yield</span> reduction. Thus, it is of great interest to obtain soybean genotypes tolerant to water deficit. The <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> trait is difficult to obtain through classical breeding due to its polygenic basis. In this context, genetic engineering is presented as a way to achieve this attribute. The ability to modulate the expression of many genes placed the transcription factors as promising biotechnological targets to develop stress tolerant cultivars. The WRKY proteins form a large family of transcription factors that are involved in important physiological and biochemical processes in plants, including the response to water deficit. In this study, the expression pattern determined by qPCR showed that, <span class="gene">GmWRKY6,</span> <span class="gene">GmWRKY46,</span> <span class="gene">GmWRKY56,</span> <span class="gene">GmWRKY106</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY149</span> genes are differentially expressed between a <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerant and a susceptible soybean genotype in water stress conditions. The in silico promoter and coexpression analysis indicate that these genes act in a stress physiological background.

						BACKGROUND: The developmental and cell death domain (DCD)-containing asparagine-rich proteins (NRPs) were first identified in soybean (Glycine max) as transducers of a cell death signal derived from prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, osmotic stress, <span class="trait">drought</span> or developmentally-programmed leaf senescence via the <span class="gene">GmNAC81/GmNAC30/GmVPE</span> signaling module. In spite of the relevance of the DCD/NRP-mediated signaling as a versatile adaptive response to multiple stresses, mechanistic knowledge of the pathway is lacking and the extent to which this pathway may operate in the plant kingdom has not been investigated. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that the DCD/NRP-mediated signaling also propagates a stress-induced cell death signal in other plant species with features of a programmed cell death (PCD) response. In silico analysis revealed that several plant genomes harbor conserved sequences of the pathway components, which share functional analogy with their soybean counterparts. We showed that <span class="gene">GmNRPs,</span> <span class="gene">GmNAC81and</span> VPE orthologs from Arabidopsis, designated as AtNRP-1, AtNRP-2, ANAC036 and gVPE, respectively, induced cell death when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves. In addition, loss of AtNRP1 and AtNRP2 function attenuated ER stress-induced cell death in Arabidopsis, which was in marked contrast with the enhanced cell death phenotype displayed by overexpressing lines as compared to Col-0. Furthermore, atnrp-1 knockout mutants displayed enhanced sensitivity to PEG-induced osmotic stress, a phenotype that could be complemented with ectopic expression of either <span class="gene">GmNRP-A</span> or <span class="gene">GmNRP-B.</span> In addition, AtNRPs, ANAC036 and gVPE were induced by osmotic and ER stress to an extent that was modulated by the ER-resident molecular chaperone binding protein (BiP) similarly as in soybean. Finally, as putative downstream components of the NRP-mediated cell death signaling, the stress induction of AtNRP2, ANAC036 and gVPE was dependent on the AtNRP1 function. BiP overexpression also conferred <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to water stress in Arabidopsis, most likely due to modulation of the drought-induced NRP-mediated cell death response. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the NRP-mediated cell death signaling operates in the plant kingdom with conserved regulatory mechanisms and hence may be target for engineering stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and adaptation in crops.

						From soybean plant, 131 bZIP genes were identified and named as <span class="gene">GmbZIPs.</span> The <span class="gene">GmbZIPs</span> can be classified into ten groups and more than one third of these <span class="gene">GmbZIPs</span> are responsive to at least one of the four treatments including ABA, salt, <span class="trait">drought</span> and cold stresses. Previous studies have shown that group A bZIP proteins are involved in ABA and stress signaling. We now chose four non-group A genes to study their features. The four proteins <span class="gene">GmbZIP44,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP46,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> belong to the group S, I, C and G, respectively, and can bind to GLM (GTGAGTCAT), ABRE (CCACGTGG) and PB-like (TGAAAA) elements with differential affinity in both the yeast one-hybrid assay and in vitro gel-shift analysis. <span class="gene">GmbZIP46</span> can form homodimer or heterodimer with <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> or <span class="gene">GmMYB76.</span> Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the <span class="gene">GmbZIP44,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> or <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> showed reduced ABA sensitivity. However, all the transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt and freezing stresses when compared with the Col plants. The <span class="gene">GmbZIP44,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> may function in ABA signaling through upregulation of ABI1 and ABI2 and play roles in stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through regulation of various stress-responsive genes. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmbZIP44,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> are negative regulators of ABA signaling and function in salt and freezing <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

						DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein) transcription factors have important roles in the stress-related regulation network in plants. A DREB orthologue, <span class="gene">GmDREB3,</span> belonging to the A-5 subgroup of the DREB subfamily, was isolated from soybean using the RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) method. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> in soybean seedlings was induced following cold stress treatment for 0.5 h and was not detected after 3 h. However, it was not induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salt stresses or by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. This response was similar to those of members in the A-1 subgroup and different from those of other members in the A-5 subgroup, suggesting that the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> gene was involved in an ABA-independent cold stress-responsive signal pathway. Furthermore, analysis of the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> promoter elucidated its cold-induced modulation. A promoter fragment containing bases -1058 to -664 was involved in response to cold stress, and its effect was detected for 1 h after treatment, but a transcriptional repressor appeared to impair this response by binding to a cis-element in the region -1403 to -1058 at 24 h after the beginning of cold stress. Moreover, the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> protein could specifically bind to the DRE element in vitro, and activated expression of downstream reporter genes in yeast cells. In addition, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to cold, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and high salt stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis. Physiological analyses indicated that the fresh weight and osmolality of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> transgenic Arabidopsis under cold stress were higher than those of wild-type controls. <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> transgenic tobacco accumulated higher levels of free proline under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and retained higher leaf chlorophyll levels under high salt stress than wild-type tobacco. In addition, constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis caused growth retardation, whereas its expression under control of the stress-inducible Rd29A promoter minimized negative effects on plant growth under normal growth conditions, indicating that a combination of the Rd29A promoter and <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> might be useful for improving <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to environmental stresses in crop plants.

						Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane protein channels that are members of Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIP) superfamily. AQPs play important roles in plant reproduction, cell elongation, osmoregulation, influence leaf physiology and are responsive to <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Small intrinsic proteins (SIPs)belongs to one of the groups of AQPs, which are mainly localized to endoplasmic reticulum(ER). While this group of aquaporin is being well studied in Arabidopsis, grape and other plant species, not much is known about the molecular regulatory mechanisms driven by ER-type AQPs in Glycine Max. In this study, the function of <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> is studied in detail by using both yeast and plant systems. <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> showed a ubiquitous expression pattern in all different tissues in Glycine Max. Heterologous expression of <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> in Nicotiana tabacum conferred a short root phenotype,growth retardation at seedling stage and significant <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to oxidative stress (H2O2) both in yeast and plant systems. Auxin (IAA) content significantly increased in transgenic plants compared with that of wild type, however, the abscisic acid (ABA) content was significantly reduced. Subcellular localization and colocalization analyses showed <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> localized to ER plasma membrane. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> is involved in oxidative stress pathways.

						Plant basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors play important roles in many biological processes. In the present study, a bZIP gene, <span class="gene">GmbZIP132,</span> was cloned from soybean and its biological function under abiotic stresses was studied. The transcription of <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> was induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salt treatments. Among all of the organs analyzed, its expression was the highest in cotytledon and stems. <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> could weakly bind to the GCN4-like motif (GLM) (5'-GTGAGTCAT-3') in yeast one-hybrid assay. Compared with wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants, transgenic plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> showed reduced abscisic acid sensitivity and increased water loss rate. At the stage of germination, transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt treatment than wild-type plants. The expression of some abiotic stress-related genes, such as rd29B, DREB2A, and P5CS, were upregulated in the transgenic plants. These results indicated that <span class="gene">GmbZIP132</span> was an abiotic stress-related gene, and its overexpression could increase the salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of transgenic Arabidopsis plants during germination, yet no significant difference of <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to abiotic stresses was found between transgenic and wild type plants at the seedling stage.

						MYB-type transcription factors (MYB TFs) play diverse roles in plant development and stress responses. However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of MYB TFs during stress response remain unclear. In this study we identified a R2R3-MYB TF in soybean (Glycine max), denoted <span class="gene">GmMYB84,</span> which contributes to <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Expression of <span class="gene">GmMYB84</span> was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt stress, H2O2 and ABA. Compared with the wild type (WT), <span class="gene">GmMYB84-overexpressing</span> soybean mutants (OE lines) exhibited enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> with a higher survival rate, longer primary root length, greater proline and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, higher antioxidant enzyme activities [peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], a lower dehydration rate and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content. We also found that ROS could induce SOD/POD/CAT activity in OE lines. In particular, we found that the optimal level of ROS is required for <span class="gene">GmMYB84</span> to modulate primary root elongation. Some ROS-related genes were up-regulated under abiotic stress in <span class="gene">GmMYB84</span> transgenic plants compared with the WT. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmMYB84</span> binds directly to the promoter of <span class="gene">GmRBOHB-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmRBOHB-2</span> genes. Based on this evidence, we propose a model for how <span class="gene">GmMYB84,</span> H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes work together to control root growth under both optimal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A novel glycogen synthase kinase-3 gene, <span class="gene">GmGSK,</span> was isolated from Glycine max. It is 1,596 bp in length with one ORF of 410 amino acids. Southern blot analysis revealed that it has at least two copies in the G. max genome. <span class="gene">GmGSK,</span> when transiently expressed in Nicotiana tabacum leaves, was localized in both cell membrane and cytoplasm. Northern blot analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmGSK</span> is expressed in all tissues, with highest expression in the root. <span class="gene">GmGSK</span> can be induced by various abiotic stresses. When transformed with <span class="gene">GmGSK,</span> Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibited enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> to salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Heterotrimeric G-proteins (α, β and γ subunits) are primarily involved in diverse signaling processes by transducing signals from an activated transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) to appropriate downstream effectors within cells. The role of α and β G-protein subunits in salinity and heat stress has been reported but the regulation of γ subunit of plant G-proteins in response to abiotic stress has not heretofore been described. In the present study we report the isolation of full-length cDNAs of two isoforms of Gγ [RGG1(I), 282 bp and RGG2(I), 453 bp] from rice (Oryza sativa cv Indica group Swarna) and described their transcript regulation in response to abiotic stresses. Protein sequence alignment and pairwise comparison of γ subunits of Indica rice [RGG(I)] with other known plant G-protein γ subunits demonstrated high homology to barley (HvGs) while soybean <span class="gene">(GmG2)</span> and Arabidopsis (AGG1) were least related. The numbers of the exons and introns were found to be similar between RGG1(I) and RGG2(I), but their sizes were different. Analyses of promoter sequences of RGG(I) confirmed the presence of stress-related cis-regulatory signature motifs suggesting their active and possible independent roles in abiotic stress signaling. The transcript levels of RGG1(I) and RGG2(I) were upregulated following NaCl, cold, heat and ABA treatments. However, in <span class="trait">drought</span> stress only RGG1(I) was upregulated. Strong support by transcript profiling suggests that γ subunits play a critical role via cross talk in signaling pathways. These findings provide first direct evidence for roles of Gγ subunits of rice G-proteins in regulation of abiotic stresses. These findings suggest the possible exploitation of γ subunits of G-protein machinery for promoting stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of proline in plants. By the 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'-RACE) approach, a 2,246-bp cDNA sequence was obtained from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), denominated PvP5CS2 differing from another <span class="gene">P5CS</span> gene that we cloned previously from common bean (PvP5CS). The predicted amino acid sequence of PvP5CS2 has an overall 93.2% identity <span class="gene">GmP5CS</span> (Glycine max L. P5CS). However, PvP5CS2 shows only 83.7% identity in amino acid sequence to PvP5CS, suggesting PvP5CS2 represents a homolog of the soybean <span class="gene">P5CS</span> gene. Abundant indel (insertion and deletion events) and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were found in the cloned PvP5CS2 genome sequence when comparing 24 cultivated and 3 wild common bean accessions and these in turn reflected aspects of common bean evolution. Sequence alignment showed that genotypes from the same gene pool had similar nucleotide variation, while genotypes from different gene pools had distinctly different nucleotide variation for PvP5CS2. Furthermore, diversity along the gene sequence was not evenly distributed, being low in the glutamic-g-semialdehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing region, moderate in the Glu-5-kinase catalyzing region and high in the intervening region. Neutrality tests showed that PvP5CS2 was a conserved gene undergoing negative selection. A new marker (Pv97) was developed for genetic mapping of PvP5CS2 based on an indel between DOR364 and G19833 sequences and the gene was located between markers Bng126 and BMd045 on chromosome b01. The relationship of PvP5CS2 and a previously cloned pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase gene as well as the implications of this work on selecting for <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in common bean are discussed.

						Osmotic stress induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> can hinder the growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> of crop plants. To understand the eco-physiological role of osmoprotectants, the combined utilization of endophytes and osmolytes (trehalose) can be an ideal strategy used to overcome the adverse effects of <span class="trait">drought.</span> Hence, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of Sphingomonas sp. LK11, which produces phytohormones and synthesizes trehalose, in improving soybean plant growth under drought-induced osmotic stress (-0.4, -0.9, and -1.2MPa). The results showed that the inoculation of soybean plants with Sphingomonas sp. LK11 significantly increased plant length, dry biomass, photosynthetic pigments, glutathione, amino acids (proline, glycine, and glutamate), and primary sugars as compared to control plants under varying <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses. Trehalose applied to the plant with or without endophyte-inoculation also showed similar plant growth-promoting attributes under stress. Stress exposure significantly enhanced endogenous jasmonic (JA) and abscisic (ABA) acid contents in control plants. In contrast, Sphingomonas sp. LK11-inoculation significantly lowered ABA and JA levels in soybean plants, but these phytohormones increased in response to combined treatments during stress. The drought-induced osmotic stress <span class="trait">resistance</span> associated with Sphingomonas sp. LK11 and trehalose was also evidenced by increased mRNA gene expression of soybean dehydration responsive element binding protein (DREB)-type transcription factors <span class="gene">(GmDREBa</span> and <span class="gene">GmDREB2)</span> and the MYB (myeloblastosis) transcription factor <span class="gene">(GmMYBJ1)</span> as compared to the control. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that inoculation with this endophyte and trehalose improved the negative effects of drought-induced osmotic stress, and it enhanced soybean plant growth and <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) proteins are important transcription factors in plant stress response and signal transduction. In this study, a DREB homolog gene, DvDREB2A, was isolated from chrysanthemum (Dendranthema vestitum) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. It contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,471 bp encoding 366 amino acid residues and was classified as a <span class="gene">DREB2</span> subfamily member based on multiple sequence alignment. The predicted protein sequence contained a typical AP2/EREBP DNA-binding domain near the N-terminal region. In yeast one-hybrid analysis DvDREB2A protein was specifically bound to DRE elements (core sequence, A/GCCGAC) and activated the expression of the reporter <span class="gene">HIS3</span> and LacZ. Transient expression experiment suggested that DvDREB2A protein was localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) experiments showed that expression level of DvDREB2A was significantly affected by heat, low temperature, <span class="trait">drought,</span> abscisic acid (ABA) and high salinity treatments. These results indicated that the DvDREB2A gene is a new member of the DREB transcription factors, which may play an important role in providing <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to environmental stresses.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The Panax ginseng <span class="gene">TIP</span> gene PgTIP1 was previously demonstrated to have high water channel activity by its heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in yeast; it also plays a significant role in growth of PgTIP1-transgenic Arabidopsis plants under favorable conditions and has enhanced <span class="trait">tolerance</span> toward salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> treatment. In this work, we first investigated the physiological effects of heterologous PgTIP1 expression in soybean cotyledon hairy roots or composite plants mediated by Agrobacterium rhizogenes toward enhanced salt <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> The PgTIP1-transgenic soybean plants mediated by the pollen tube pathway, represented by the lines N and J11, were analyzed at the physiological and molecular levels for enhanced salt <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> The results showed that in terms of root-specific heterologous expression, the PgTIP1-transformed soybean cotyledon hairy roots or composite plants displayed superior salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> compared to the empty vector-transformed ones according to the mitigatory effects of hairy root growth reduction, drop in leaf RWC, and rise in REL under salt stress. Additionally, declines in K+ content, increases in Na+ content and Na+/K+ ratios in the hairy roots, stems, or leaves were effectively alleviated by PgTIP1-transformation, particularly the stems and leaves of composite soybean plants. At the whole plant level, PgTIP1-trasgenic soybean lines were found to possess stronger root vigor, reduced root and leaf cell membrane damage, increased SOD, POD, CAT, and APX activities, steadily increased leaf Tr, RWC, and Pn values, and smaller declines in chlorophyll and carotenoid content when exposed to salt stress compared to wild type. Moreover, the distribution patterns of Na+, K+, and Cl- in the roots, stems, and leaves of salt-stressed transgenic plants were readjusted, in that the absorbed Na+ and Cl- were mainly restricted to the roots to reduce their transport to the shoots, and the transport of root-absorbed K+ to the shoots was simultaneously promoted. PgTIP1 transformation into soybean plants enhanced the expression of some stress-related genes <span class="gene">(GmPOD,</span> <span class="gene">GmAPX1,</span> <span class="gene">GmSOS1,</span> and <span class="gene">GmCLC1)</span> in the roots and leaves under salt treatment. This indicates that the causes of enhanced salt <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of heterologous PgTIP1-transformed soybean are associated with the positive regulation on water relations, ion homeostasis, and ROS scavenging under salt stress both at root-specific and whole plant levels.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The plant membrane-localized NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOHs), play crucial roles in various cellular activities, including plant disease responses, and are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a cosmopolitan fungal pathogen that causes Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in soybean. Via a key virulence factor, oxalic acid, it induces programmed cell death (PCD) in the host plant, a process that is reliant on ROS generation. In this study, using protein sequence similarity searches, we identified 17 soybean RBOHs <span class="gene">(GmRBOHs)</span> and studied their contribution to SSR disease development, <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> and nodulation. We clustered the soybean RBOH genes into six groups of orthologues based on phylogenetic analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts. Transcript analysis of all 17 <span class="gene">GmRBOHs</span> revealed that, of the six identified groups, group VI <span class="gene">(GmRBOH-VI)</span> was specifically and drastically induced following S. sclerotiorum challenge. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI</span> using Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) resulted in enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> to S. sclerotiorum and markedly reduced ROS levels during disease development. Coincidently, <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI-silenced</span> plants were also found to be <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerant, but showed a reduced capacity to form nodules. Our results indicate that the pathogenic development of S. sclerotiorum in soybean requires the active participation of specific host RBOHs, to induce ROS and cell death, thus leading to the establishment of disease.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transcription factors play vital roles in plant growth and in plant responses to abiotic stresses. The <span class="gene">RAV</span> transcription factors contain a B3 DNA binding domain and/or an APETALA2 (AP2) DNA binding domain. Although genome-wide analyses of <span class="gene">RAV</span> family genes have been performed in several species, little is known about the family in soybean (Glycine max L.). In this study, a total of 13 <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes, named as <span class="gene">GmRAVs,</span> were identified in the soybean genome. We predicted and analyzed the amino acid compositions, phylogenetic relationships, and folding states of conserved domain sequences of soybean <span class="gene">RAV</span> transcription factors. These soybean <span class="gene">RAV</span> transcription factors were phylogenetically clustered into three classes based on their amino acid sequences. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the soybean <span class="gene">RAV</span> proteins were located in the nucleus. The expression patterns of 13 <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Under <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses, the <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes expressed diversely, up- or down-regulated. Following NaCl treatments, all <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes were down-regulated excepting <span class="gene">GmRAV-03</span> which was up-regulated. Under abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, the expression of all of the soybean <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes increased dramatically. These results suggested that the soybean <span class="gene">RAV</span> genes may be involved in diverse signaling pathways and may be responsive to abiotic stresses and exogenous ABA. Further analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmRAV-03</span> could increase the transgenic lines <span class="trait">resistance</span> to high salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> and result in the transgenic plants insensitive to exogenous ABA. This present study provides valuable information for understanding the classification and putative functions of the <span class="gene">RAV</span> transcription factors in soybean.

						In different plant species, aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate water movement by regulating root hydraulic conductivity under diverse stress conditions such as salt and water stresses. To improve survival and <span class="trait">yield</span> of crop plants, a detailed understanding of stress responses is imperative and required. We used Glycine soja genome as a tool to study AQPs, considering it shows abundant genetic diversity and higher salt environment <span class="trait">tolerance</span> features and identified 62 Gs AQP genes. Additionally, this study identifies major aquaporins responsive to salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses in soybean and elucidates their mode of action through yeast two-hybrid assay and BiFC. Under stress condition, the expression analysis of AQPs in roots and leaves of two contrasting ecotypes of soybean revealed diverse expression patterns suggesting complex regulation at transcriptional level. Based on expression analysis, we identify <span class="gene">GmTIP2;1</span> as a potential candidate involved in salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> responses. The overexpression of <span class="gene">GmTIP2;1</span> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as in-planta enhanced salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> We identified that <span class="gene">GmTIP2;1</span> forms homodimers as well as interacts with <span class="gene">GmTIP1;7</span> and <span class="gene">GmTIP1;8.</span> This study augments our knowledge of stress responsive pathways and also establishes <span class="gene">GmTIP2;1</span> as a new stress responsive gene in imparting salt stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) superfamily, specifically the SNAP25-type proteins and t-SNAREs, have been proposed to regulate cellular processes and plant <span class="trait">resistance</span> mechanisms. However, little is known about the role of SNAP25-type proteins in combating abiotic stresses, specifically in wild soybean. In the current study, the isolation and functional characterization of the putative synaptosomal-associated SNAP25-type protein gene GsSNAP33 from wild soybean (Glycine soja) were performed. GsSNAP33 has a molecular weight of 33,311 Da and comprises 300 amino acid residues along with Qb-Qc SNARE domains. Multiple sequence alignment revealed the highest similarity of the GsSNAP33 protein to <span class="gene">GmSNAP33</span> (91%), VrSNAP33 (89%), PvSNAP33 (86%) and AtSNAP33 (63%). Phylogenetic studies revealed the abundance of SNAP33 proteins mostly in dicotyledons. Quantitative real-time PCR assays confirmed that GsSNAP33 expression can be induced by salt, alkali, ABA and PEG treatments and that GsSNAP33 is highly expressed in the pods, seeds and roots of Glycine soja. Furthermore, the overexpression of the GsSNAP33 gene in WT Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in increased germination rates, greater root lengths, improved photosynthesis, lower electrolyte leakage, higher biomass production and up-regulated expression levels of various stress-responsive marker genes, including KINI, COR15A, P5Cs, RAB18, <span class="gene">RD29A</span> and COR47 in transgenic lines compared with those in WT lines. Subcellular localization studies revealed that the GsSNAP33-eGFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane, while eGFP was distributed throughout whole cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that GsSNAP33, a novel plasma membrane protein gene of Glycine soja, might be involved in improving plant responses to salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses in Arabidopsis.

						Previously, it was reported that miR396s interact with growth-regulating factors (GRFs) to modulate plant growth, development, and stress <span class="trait">resistance.</span> In soybean, 11 gma-miR396 precursors (Pre-miR396a-k) were found, and 24 <span class="gene">GmGRFs</span> were predicted as targets of seven mature gma-miR396s (gma-miR396a/b/c/e/h/i/k). To explore the roles of the miR396-GRF module in low water availability response of soybean, we analyzed the expression of Pre-miR396a-k, and found that Pre-miR396a/i/bdgk/e/h were up-regulated in leaves and down-regulated in roots; on the contrary, <span class="gene">GmGRF5/6/7/8/15/17/21</span> were down-regulated in leaves and <span class="gene">GmGRF1/2/17/18/19/20/21/22/23/24</span> were up-regulated in roots of low water potential stressed soybean. Any one of gma-miR396a/b/c/e/h/i/k was able to interact with 20 <span class="gene">GmGRFs</span> <span class="gene">(GmGRF1/2/6-11/13-24),</span> confirming that this module represents a multi-to-multi network interaction. We generated Arabidopsis plants over-expressing each of the 11 gma-miR396 precursors (Pre-miR396a-k), and seven of them (miR396a/b/c/e/h/i/k-OE transgenic Arabidopsis) showed altered development. The low water availability of miR396a/b/c/e/h/i/k-OE was enhanced in leaves but reduced in seeds and roots. Contrary to previous reports, miR396a/b/c/i-OE seedlings showed lower survival rate than WT when recovering after rewatering under soil drying. In general, we believe our findings are valuable to understand the role of gma-miR396 family in coordinating development and low water availability responses, and can provide potential strategies and directions for soybean breeding programs to improve seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and plant <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>

						Phytic acid (PA) is implicative in a spectrum of biochemical and physiological processes involved in plant stress response. Inositol 1,3,4, Tris phosphate 5/6 kinase (ITPK), a polyphosphate kinase that converts Inositol 1,3,4 trisphosphate to Inositol 1,3,4,5/6 tetra phosphate, averting the inositol phosphate pool towards PA biosynthesis, is a key regulator that exists in four different isoforms in soybean. In the present study, in-silico analysis of the promoter region of ITPKs was done and among the four isoforms, promoter region of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> showed the presence of two MYB binding elements for <span class="trait">drought</span> inducibility and one for ABA response. Expression profiling through qRT-PCR under <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity stress showed higher expression of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform compared to the other members of the family. The study revealed <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> as an early dehydration responsive gene which is also induced by dehydration and exogenous treatment with ABA. To evaluate the osmo-protective role of <span class="gene">GmITPK2,</span> attempts were made to assess the bacterial growth on Luria Broth media containing 200 mM NaCl, 16% PEG and 100 μM ABA, individually. The transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> gene depicted better growth on the media compared to the bacterial cells containing the vector alone. Similarly, the growth of the transformed cells in the liquid media containing 200 mM NaCl, 16% PEG and 100 μM ABA showed higher absorbance at 600 nm compared to control, at different time intervals. The <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> recombinant E. coli cells showing <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity thus demonstrated the functional redundancy of the gene across taxa. The purity and specificity of the recombinant protein was assessed and confirmed through PAGE showing a band of ∼35 kDa on western blotting using Anti- Penta His- HRP conjugate antibody. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report exemplifying the role of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform in <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean.
