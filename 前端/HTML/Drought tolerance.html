				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Here, we have compared the expression levels of a subset of <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes in drought-tolerant DT51 and drought-sensitive MTD720 under both normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions aimed at identifying correlation between <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> expression levels and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> degree, as well as potential <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> candidates for genetic engineering.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seven and 13 of 23 tested <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> showed higher expression levels in roots of DT51 in comparison with MTD720 under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions, respectively, whereas none of them displayed lower transcript levels under any conditions.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This finding suggests that the higher <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of DT51 might be positively correlated with the higher induction of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes during water deficit.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						These data together suggest that <span class="gene">GmNAC011,</span> 085, 092, 095, 101 and 109 might be promising candidates for improvement of <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean by biotechnological approaches.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, the expression of 23 drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was assessed in the shoot tissues of DT51 and MTD720, the two soybean varieties with contrasting drought-responsive phenotypes, by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Results indicated that expression profile of <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was genotype-dependent, and six <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> <span class="gene">(GmNAC019,</span> 043, 062, 085, 095 and 101) had higher transcript levels in the shoots of the drought-tolerant DT51 in comparison with the drought-sensitive MTD720 under <span class="trait">drought</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our study suggests a positive correlation between the higher <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> degree of DT51 versus MTD720 and the up-regulation of at least these six drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> in the shoot tissues.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Differential expression of many clock and <span class="gene">SUB1</span> genes was found under flooding and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, natural variation in the amplitude and phase shifts in PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> genes was also discovered under <span class="trait">drought</span> and flooding conditions, respectively.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						PRR3 exhibited flooding- and drought-specific splicing patterns and may work in concert with PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> to achieve energy homeostasis under flooding and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, <span class="gene">GmIPT)</span> and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, <span class="gene">GmCKX)</span> genes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our systematic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is hypothesized that <span class="gene">AAH</span> gene expression in soybean determines shoot ureide concentrations during water-deficit stress and is responsible for the differential sensitivities of the N(2)-fixation response to <span class="trait">drought</span> among soybean genotypes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objectives were to examine the relationship between <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcript levels and shoot ureide concentration and <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						However, expression of <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcripts was similar among water treatments and genotypes, indicating that <span class="gene">AAH</span> mRNA was not closely associated with <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Further study of <span class="gene">AAH</span> at the post-translational and enzymatic levels is warranted in order to dissect the potential role of this gene in <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span>.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nine <span class="gene">GmPUB</span> genes, <span class="gene">GmPUB1-GmPUB9,</span> showed induced expression patterns by <span class="trait">drought,</span> and the expression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> was also induced by exogenous ABA and NaCl.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Heterogeneous overexpression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> in Arabidopsis showed decreased <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance,</span> enhanced sensitivity with respect to osmotic and salt stress inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth, and inhibited ABA- and mannitol-mediated stomatal closure.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was highly induced by ABA, <span class="trait">drought,</span> high salt and low temperature; and <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was expressed in soybean roots, stems and leaves under different stress conditions.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> enhanced the responses of transgenic plants to ABA and triggered stomatal closure under stresses, potentially leading to improved tolerances to several abiotic stresses such as high salt, low temperature and <span class="trait">drought</span> in transgenic plants.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> affected the expression of some ABA or stress-related genes involved in regulating stomatal closure in Arabidopsis under ABA, <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salt stress conditions.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Moreover, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was used to improve the <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> trait of Chinese wheat varieties BS93.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Functional analysis showed that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> enhanced the <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of transgenic wheat, and transcripts of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> were detected in transgenic wheat using RT-PCR.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In addition, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> overexpression did not result in growth retardation in all transgenic plants, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> may be a valuable genetic resource for engineering stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> of crops.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <span class="gene">GmbZIPs</span> can be classified into ten groups and more than one third of these <span class="gene">GmbZIPs</span> are responsive to at least one of the four treatments including ABA, salt, <span class="trait">drought</span> and cold stresses.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <span class="gene">GmbZIP44,</span> <span class="gene">GmbZIP62</span> and <span class="gene">GmbZIP78</span> may function in ABA signaling through upregulation of ABI1 and ABI2 and play roles in stress <span class="trait">tolerance</span> through regulation of various stress-responsive genes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>

					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared with the wild type (WT), <span class="gene">GmMYB84-overexpressing</span> soybean mutants (OE lines) exhibited enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> with a higher survival rate, longer primary root length, greater proline and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, higher antioxidant enzyme activities [peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], a lower dehydration rate and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the present study, in-silico analysis of the promoter region of ITPKs was done and among the four isoforms, promoter region of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> showed the presence of two MYB binding elements for <span class="trait">drought</span> inducibility and one for ABA response.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Expression profiling through qRT-PCR under <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity stress showed higher expression of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform compared to the other members of the family.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report exemplifying the role of <span class="gene">GmITPK2</span> isoform in <span class="trait">drought</span> and salinity <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean.
