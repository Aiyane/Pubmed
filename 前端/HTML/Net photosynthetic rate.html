				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant U-box (PUB) E3 ubiquitin ligases play important roles in hormone signaling pathways and response to abiotic stresses, but little is known about them in soybean, Glycine max. Here, we identified and characterized 125 PUB genes from the soybean genome, which were classified into eight groups according to their protein domains. Soybean PUB genes <span class="gene">(GmPUB</span> genes) are broadly expressed in many tissues and are a little more abundant in the roots than in the other tissues. Nine <span class="gene">GmPUB</span> genes, <span class="gene">GmPUB1-GmPUB9,</span> showed induced expression patterns by <span class="trait">drought,</span> and the expression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> was also induced by exogenous ABA and NaCl. <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> was localized to post-Golgi compartments, interacting with <span class="gene">GmE2</span> protein as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments, and showed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by in vitro ubiquitination assay. Heterogeneous overexpression of <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> in Arabidopsis showed decreased <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance, enhanced sensitivity with respect to osmotic and salt stress inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth, and inhibited ABA- and mannitol-mediated stomatal closure. Eight <span class="trait">drought</span> stress-related genes were less induced in <span class="gene">GmPUB8-overexpressing</span> Arabidopsis after <span class="trait">drought</span> treatment compared with the wild type and the pub23 mutant. Taken together, our results suggested that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> might negatively regulate plant response to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. In addition, Y2H and BiFC showed that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> interacted with soybean COL (CONSTANS LIKE) protein. <span class="gene">GmPUB8-overexpressing</span> Arabidopsis flowered earlier under middle- and short-day conditions but later under long-day conditions, indicating that <span class="gene">GmPUB8</span> might regulate flowering time in the photoperiod pathway. This study helps us to understand the functions of PUB E3 ubiquitin ligases in soybean.

						Reproductive period (RP) is an important trait of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] It is closely related to <span class="trait">yield,</span> quality and tolerances to environmental stresses. To investigate the inheritance and photoperiod response of RP in soybean, the F(1), F(2), and F(2:3) populations derived from nine crosses were developed. The inheritance of RP was analyzed through the joint segregation analysis. It was shown that the RP was controlled by one major gene plus polygenes. 181 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from the cross of Xuyong Hongdou × Baohexuan 3 were further used for QTL mapping of RP under normal conditions across 3 environments, using 127 SSR markers. Four QTLs, designated qRP-c-1, qRP-g-1, qRP-m-1 and qRP-m-2, were mapped on C1, G and M linkage groups, respectively. The QTL qRP-c-1 on the linkage group <span class="gene">C1</span> showed stable effect across environments and explained 25.6, 27.5 and 21.4% of the phenotypic variance in Nanjing 2002, Beijing 2003 and Beijing 2004, respectively. Under photoperiod-controlled conditions, qRP-c-1, and two different QTLs designated qRP-l-1 and qRP-o-1, respectively, were mapped on the linkage groups L and O. qRP-o-1 was detected under SD condition and can explained 10.70% of the phenotypic variance. qRP-c-1 and qRP-l-1 were detected under LD condition and for photoperiod sensitivity. The two major-effect QTLs can explain 19.03 and 19.00% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, under LD condition and 16.25 and 14.12%, respectively, for photoperiod sensitivity. Comparative mapping suggested that the two major-effect QTLs, qRP-c-1 and qRP-l-1, might associate with E8 or <span class="gene">GmCRY1a</span> and the maturity gene E3 or <span class="gene">GmPhyA3,</span> respectively. These results could facilitate our understanding of the inheritance of RP and provide information on marker-assisted breeding for high <span class="trait">yield</span> and wide adaptation in soybean.

						Soybean genotypes are adapted to narrow bands of latitude due to photoperiod sensitivity. There are several photoperiod-sensitive loci (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, E8). Determinate and indeterminate growth habits are controlled by a single locus. The objective of our research was to examine the effects of photoperiod sensitivity and growth habit alleles on seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and other agronomic characters using isogenic lines. Twenty 'Harosoy' isolines with 11 photoperiod-sensitive genotypes many with both indeterminate and determinate growth habits were grown in the field at Ottawa, ON, from 2003 to 2007. Maturity ranged from 97 to 127 days, and seed <span class="trait">yield</span> increased linearly with maturity until about 112 days when it plateaued. Determinate lines were always shorter than indeterminate lines of equivalent maturity. Seed <span class="trait">yield</span> was associated with plant height, maturity, seed sugar concentration, seed weight and <span class="trait">lodging.</span> Effects of alleles at individual loci, and additive and epistatic effects across multiple loci were examined. At a single locus, photoperiod-insensitive alleles produced isolines that matured 8-11 days earlier, yielded less, and had shorter plants with reduced <span class="trait">lodging.</span> In multiple loci analyses, additive effects explained most of the variation in agronomic characters since additive models with E1, E3, E4, E7 and <span class="gene">Dt1</span> loci included compared well to additive plus epistatic models and genotype-based models. Variation in photoperiod sensitivity and growth habit alleles results in a range of maturity, with pleiotropic effects on seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and agronomic characteristics, and play an important role in providing adaptation across latitudes.
