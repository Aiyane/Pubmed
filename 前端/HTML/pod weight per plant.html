						In response to low Pi availability, <span class="trait">plant</span> roots adaptively change their morphology, physiology, and biochemistry, including enhanced adventitious rooting and lateral root <span class="trait">branching,</span> greater root hair and cluster root formation, increased mobilization of sparse soluble soil/fertilizer P by root exudates such as phosphatase and ribonuclease enzymes, upregulated activity of Pi transporters, and increased symbiotic association with AM fungi ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0052"> Vance <italic> et al </italic> ., 2003 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026"> Lambers <italic> et al </italic> ., 2006 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0045"> Shen <italic> et al </italic> ., 2011 </xref> ). However, the investigated root traits responded to P supply in contrasting patterns under the current experimental conditions.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objectives of this study were to use mixed models to confirm the presence of genetic variability in 16 soybean genotypes, to compare clusters generated by artificial neural networks (ANNs) with those created by the Ward modified location model (MLM) technique, and to indicate parental combinations that hold promise for obtaining superior segregating populations of soybean. A field trial was conducted between November 2014 and February 2015 at Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul, Aquidauana, MS. The experimental design consisted of four replications of randomized blocks, each containing 16 treatments. We assessed the following agronomic traits: <span class="trait">plant</span> height, first <span class="trait">pod</span> height, number of branches <span class="trait">per</span> <span class="trait">plant,</span> number of pods <span class="trait">per</span> <span class="trait">plant,</span> number of grains <span class="trait">per</span> <span class="trait">pod,</span> hundred-grain <span class="trait">weight,</span> and grain <span class="trait">yield.</span> Mixed models were used to estimate variance components and genetic parameters, and obtain genotypic values for each trait. After verifying the presence of genetic variability for all traits, genotypic values were submitted to both a Ward-MLM procedure and ANNs to estimate genetic divergence among genotypes. The number of groups formed by both methods was the same, but there were differences in group constitutions. <span class="gene">ANN</span> analysis improved soybean genotypes clustering patterns compared to Ward-MLM procedure. Based on these methods, divergent crosses may be made between genotype 97R73 with genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070, whereas convergent crosses may be made between genotypes AS3797 and SYN9070.
