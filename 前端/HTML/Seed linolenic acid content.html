					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						High levels of <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (80 g kg(-1)) are associated with the development of off-flavors and poor stability in soybean oil. The development of low <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> lines such as RG10 (20 g kg(-1) <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid)</span> can reduce these problems. The level of <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil is determined by the activities of microsomal omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturases (FAD3). A major <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> QTL (&gt;70% of variation) on linkage group B2 (chromosome <span class="gene">Gm14)</span> was previously detected in a recombinant inbred line population from the RG10 × OX948 cross. The objectives of this study were to validate the major <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> QTL in an independent population and characterize all the soybean <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes. Four <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes were sequenced and localized in RG10 and OX948 and compared to the genes in the reference Williams 82 genome. The <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> gene sequences mapped to the locus <span class="gene">Glyma.14g194300</span> [on the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm14</span> (B2)], which is syntenic to the <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.02g227200)</span> on the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm02</span> (D1b). The location of the <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> gene is the same as was previously determined for the fan allele, that conditions low <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and several <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> QTL, including Linolen 3-3, mapped previously with the RG10 × OX948 population and confirmed in the PI 361088B × OX948 population as Linolen-PO (FAD3A). The <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene-based marker, developed previously, was mapped to the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm02</span> (D1b) in a region containing a newly detected <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> QTL [Linolen-RO(FAD3B)] in the RG10 × OX948 genetic map and corresponds well with the in silico position of the <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene sequences. <span class="gene">FAD3C</span> and <span class="gene">FAD3D</span> gene sequences, mapped to syntenic regions on chromosomes <span class="gene">Gm18</span> (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.18g062000)</span> and <span class="gene">Gm11</span> (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.11g227200),</span> respectively. Association of <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> QTL with the desaturase genes <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> and FAD3B, their validation in an independent population, and development of <span class="gene">FAD3</span> gene-specific markers should simplify and accelerate breeding for low <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> soybean cultivars.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) oil typically contains 8% α-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> that is highly unstable and easily oxidized. This property is undesirable in many food and industrial applications. Genetic strategies for reducing α-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> would enhance the commercial value. However, genetic resources for low α-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> are limited among natural soybean variations. Microsomal omega-3-fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase (FAD3) is responsible for the synthesis of α-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> in the polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> pathway. There are four <span class="gene">FAD3</span> homologs <span class="gene">(Glyma02g39230,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma11g27190,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma14g37350</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma18g06950)</span> in the soybean genome. While non-functional alleles have been reported for <span class="gene">Glyma02g39230</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1a)</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma14g37350</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1b),</span> little variation is seen in <span class="gene">Glyma18g06950</span> <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-2a).</span> We isolated seven mutant <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a</span> alleles, each containing a single-nucleotide substitution, from 39,100 independent mutant lines by using targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING). Analysis of <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a</span> transcripts and enzyme activities revealed that one missense mutant, 'P1-A9', contains a non-functional allele of <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a.</span> By combining three non-functional alleles <span class="gene">(GmFAD3-1a,</span> <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1b,</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2a),</span> we generated soybean lines containing &lt;2% α-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> in their seeds. The reverse-genetics-based development of novel mutant alleles in the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> metabolic pathway will allow the improvement of soybean with better oil quality through conventional breeding.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We analyzed the molecular mechanism controlling ω-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturases during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and leaf development in soybean. During germination, soybean seeds were characterized by a high 18:2(Δ9,12) level (more than 50%) and reduced 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> (10%). Interestingly, transcripts from all endoplasmic reticulum <span class="gene">(GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B)</span> and plastidial <span class="gene">(GmFAD7-1/GmFAD7-2</span> or <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1/GmFAD8-2)</span> desaturase genes were detected during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination. Upon germination, soybean trifoliate leaf development was accompanied by an increase in <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (18:3(Δ9,12,15)). Our data showed that transcripts corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD3A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD3B</span> decreased with leaf development. No changes in the expression profile of the plastidial ω-3 desaturases <span class="gene">GmFAD7-1</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD7-2</span> genes were detected. On the contrary, <span class="gene">GmFAD8-2</span> transcript levels increased while <span class="gene">GmFAD8-1</span> transcripts decreased during leaf development. Given this expression profile, our data suggested the existence of a temporal regulatory mechanism controlling ω-3 desaturases during leaf development in which the endoplasmic reticulum ω-3 desaturases would be more important in young leaves while plastidial ω-3 desaturases might contribute to 18:3(Δ9,12,15) production in mature leaves. Photosynthetic cell cultures showed 18:3(Δ9,12,15) levels similar to those from leaves. No changes in the 18:3(Δ9,12,15) <span class="trait">content</span> or expression of the ω-3 desaturase genes were detected along the cell culture cycle. A comparison of our data with those available in Arabidopsis or wheat suggested that the regulatory mechanism controlling the expression and activity of both endoplasmic reticulum and plastidial desaturases during leaf development might differ among plant species.

						High oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> soybeans were produced by combining mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. Despite having a high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> the <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of these soybeans was in the range of 4-6 %, which may be high enough to cause oxidative instability of the oil. Therefore, a study was conducted to incorporate one or two mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes into the high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> background to further reduce the <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> As a result, soybean lines with high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> and low <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (HOLL) <span class="trait">content</span> were produced using different sources of mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> genes. While oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of these HOLL lines was stable across two testing environments, the reduction of <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> varied depending on the number of mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes combined with mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes, on the severity of mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene, and on the testing environment. Combination of two mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes and one mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> gene resulted in less than 2 % <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in Portageville, Missouri (MO) while four mutant genes were needed to achieve the same <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in Columbia, MO. This study generated non-transgenic soybeans with the highest oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and lowest <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> reported to date, offering a unique alternative to produce a fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> profile similar to olive oil.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						α-Linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of ω6:ω3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> and to reduce the ratio of linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> (LA) to ALA. Six ω-3 (Δ-15) fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g⁻¹ to 8.57 mg g⁻¹ and 10.06 mg g⁻¹, respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA <span class="trait">content</span> was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2/3</span> and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet &gt;80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The alteration of fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> profiles in soybean to improve soybean oil quality has been a long-time goal of soybean researchers. Soybean oil with elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of soybean oil compared to other oils. In the lipid biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase 2 (FAD2) is responsible for the conversion of oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> precursors to linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> precursors in developing soybean seeds. Two genes encoding <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were identified to be expressed specifically in seeds during embryogenesis and have been considered to hold an important role in controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> A total of 22 soybean plant introduction (PI) lines identified to have an elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> were characterized for sequence mutations in the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. PI 603452 was found to contain a deletion of a nucleotide in the second exon of FAD2-1A. These important SNPs were used in developing molecular marker genotyping assays. The assays appear to be a reliable and accurate tool to identify the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genotype of wild-type and mutant plants. PI 603452 was subsequently crossed with PI 283327, a soybean line that has a mutation in FAD2-1B. Interestingly, soybean lines carrying both homozygous insertion/deletion mutation (indel) <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> alleles and mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles have an average of 82-86% oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> compared to 20% in conventional soybean, and low levels of linoleic and <span class="trait">linolenic</span> acids. The newly identified indel mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene offers a simple method for the development of high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> commercial soybean varieties.

						<span class="trait">Linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (LN) in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) <span class="trait">seed</span> mainly contributes to the undesirable odors and flavors commonly associated with poor oil quality. LN deposition at various stages of soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> development had not been reported by 2010. The objects of this study were (1) to identify and measure quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying LN <span class="trait">content</span> and (2) to estimate the QTL effects expressed from earlier <span class="trait">seed</span> developmental stages to drying <span class="trait">seed</span> of soybean. One hundred and twenty-five F(5:8) and F(5:9) recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross of soybean cultivars 'Hefeng 25' and 'Dongnong L5' were used for the identification of QTL underlying LN <span class="trait">content</span> from the 37 day (D) to 86D stages after flowering, at Harbin in 2008 and 2009. QTL × Environment interactions (QE) effects were evaluated using a mixed genetic model (Zhu in J Zhejiang Univ (Natural Science) 33:327-335, 1999). Twelve unconditional QTL and 12 conditional QTL associated with LN <span class="trait">content</span> were identified at different developmental stages. Most of the QTL explained &lt;10% of phenotypic variation of LN <span class="trait">content.</span> Unconditional QTL QLNF-1, QLNC2-1, QLND1b-1, QLNA2-1 and QLNH-1 influenced LN <span class="trait">content</span> across different development stages and environments. Conditional QTL QLNF-1, QLNC2-1 and QLNH-1 were identified in multiple developmental stages and environments. Conditional and unconditional QTL clustered in neighboring intervals on linkage groups A2, <span class="gene">C2</span> and D1b. Ten QTL with conditional additive main effects (a) and/or conditional additive × environment interaction effects (ae) at specific developmental stage were identified on nine linkage groups. Of them, six QTL only possessed additive main effects and seven QTL had significant ae effects in different developmental stages. A total of 13 epistatic pairwise QTL were identified by conditional mapping in different developmental stages. Two pairs of QTL only showed aa effects and five pairs of QTL only showed aae effects at different developmental stages. QTL with aa effects, as well as their environmental interaction effects, appeared to vary at different developmental stages.

						Alpha-linolenic acid(ALA, C18:3delta9,12,15 ) is an essential fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> which has many sanitary functions to human. However, its contents in diets are often not enough. In plants, omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturases(FAD) catalyze linoleic acid(LA, C18:2delta9,12) into ALA. The <span class="trait">seed</span> oil of Glycine max contains high level of ALA. To investigate the functions of Glycine max omega-3FAD, the cDNA of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C was amplified by RT-PCR from immature seeds, then cloned into the shuttle expression vector p416 to generate the recombinant vector p4GFAD3C. The resulting vector was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae K601 throuth LiAc method. The positive clones were screened on the CM(Ura-) medium and identified by PCR, and then cultured in CM (Ura-) liquid medium with exogenous LA in 20 degrees C for three days. The intracellular fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> composition of the engineering strain Kp416 and Kp4GFAD3C was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A novel peak in strain Kp4GFAD3C was detected,which was not detectable in control, Comparison of the retention times of the newly yielded peak with that of authentic standard indicated that the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> is ALA. The <span class="trait">content</span> of ALA reached to 3.1% of the total fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> in recombinant strain, the <span class="trait">content</span> of LA correspondingly decreased from 22% to 16.2% by contrast. It was suggested that the protein encoded by <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C can specifically catalyze 18 carbon PUFA substrate of LA into ALA by taking off hydrogen atoms at delta15 location. In this study, we expressed a Glycine max omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase gene in S. cerevisiae; An efficient and economical yeast expressing system(K601-p416 system) which is suitable for the expression of FAD was built.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Microsomal omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase is an essential enzyme in the production of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> alpha-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> during the <span class="trait">seed</span> developing stage. We have constructed a chimeric gene consisting of a maize Ubi1-P-int and a soybean <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> cDNA, which was introduced into rice plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Ten transformants containing the chimeric gene were established and expression subsequently confirmed by Northern blotting. Furthermore, alpha-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of the T(1) seeds increased dramatically up to tenfold that of the control, and this phenotype was also stably inherited in the T(2) and T(3) progenies. These results demonstrate that the alpha-linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of rice <span class="trait">seed</span> oil can easily be altered using the combination of a high-activity promoter and a <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> gene.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> is one of the major factors influencing the quality of vegetable oils. Edible oils rich in monounsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> provide improved oil stability, flavor, and nutrition for human and animal consumption. In plants, the microsomal omega-6 desaturase-catalyzed pathway is the primary route of production of polyunsaturated lipids. We report the isolation of two different cDNA sequences, <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FAD2-2, encoding microsomal omega-6 desaturase in soybeans and the characterization of their developmental and temperature regulation. The <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is strongly expressed in developing seeds, whereas the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene is constitutively expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. Thus, the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene-encoded omega-6 desaturase appears to be responsible for production of polyunsaturated fatty acids within membrane lipids in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. The seed-specifically expressed <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is likely to play a major role in controlling conversion of oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> to linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> within storage lipids during <span class="trait">seed</span> development. In both soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> and leaf tissues, linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> and <span class="trait">linolenic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels gradually increase as temperature decreases. However, the levels of transcripts for FAD2-1, FAD2-2, and the plastidial omega-6 desaturase gene (FAD 6) do not increase at low temperature. These results suggest that the elevated polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in developing soybean seeds grown at low temperature are not due to the enhanced expression of omega-6 desaturase genes.
