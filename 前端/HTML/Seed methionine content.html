				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared to β-conglycinin, glycinin contains 3-4 times the <span class="trait">methionine</span> and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the glycinin and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for glycinin (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of glycinin and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of glycinin. These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A <span class="gene">Gy4</span> glycinin cDNA was modified and used to produce structurally altered 11S storage protein subunits. We evaluated these modified subunits for their ability to assemble into oligomers. Alterations made in the acidic polypeptide changed the subunit solubility characteristics but did not eliminate assembly. Modifications in the basic polypeptide usually eliminated assembly of subunits into trimers. A region exhibiting high natural variability located at the COOH terminus of the acidic polypeptide that we have designated the hypervariable region was also studied. Extensive deletions and insertions were tolerated in the hypervariable region without perturbing subunit assembly. Some of the insertions significantly increased the <span class="trait">methionine</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in the <span class="gene">Gy4</span> glycinin subunit. Together, our results indicated that the structure of the basic polypeptide was more critical for assembly of trimers than that of the acidic polypeptide, an observation that implies that the basic polypeptides direct trimer formation. The assembly assays described here will be useful in efforts to improve <span class="trait">seed</span> quality. Using them, the effects of modifications to the storage protein subunits can be rapidly evaluated before introducing the mutated genes into plants.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Four subunits of beta-conglycinin were purified from soybean cultivar CX 635-1-1-1, and were designated alpha, alpha', beta, and beta' in accordance with nomenclature proposed by Thanh and Shibasaki [(1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 490, 370-384]. Of these subunits, beta' has not previously been reported or characterized. Consistent with the low levels of <span class="trait">methionine</span> in these proteins, cyanogen bromide cleavage of alpha', alpha, and beta' subunits produced only a few fragments. The beta subunit contains no <span class="trait">methionine</span> and was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits are homologous, and each has valine at its amino terminus. The beta subunit has a very different NH2-terminal sequence from those of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits, and has leucine at its amino terminus. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta' subunit could not be determined, as it appeared to be blocked to Edman degradation. Although alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits have similar NH2-terminal sequences, they differ in the number of <span class="trait">methionine</span> residues and so yielded different numbers of cyanogen bromide fragments. Two cyanogen bromide fragments (CB-1 and CB-2) were purified from the alpha subunit. CB-1 originated from the NH2-terminal end of the subunit. The amino acid sequence of CB-2 was identical to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clone pB36. The insert in pB36 encoded 216 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of the alpha subunit and contained a 138-bp trailer sequence which was followed by a poly-(A) tail. Maps showing the relative positions of <span class="trait">methionine</span> residues and carbohydrate moieties in the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits were drawn, based on primary sequence data, and the size and carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of the CNBr fragments derived from the subunits.
