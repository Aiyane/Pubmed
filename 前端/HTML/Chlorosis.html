				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Maize chlorotic dwarf virus (MCDV), a member of the genus Waikavirus, family Secoviridae, has a 11784 nt (+)ssRNA genome that encodes a 389kDa proteolytically processed polyprotein. We show that the N-terminal 78kDa <span class="gene">polyprotein</span> (R78) of MCDV acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing in a well-established assay system. We further demonstrate that R78 is cleaved by the viral 3C-like protease into 51 and 27kDa proteins (p51 and p27), and that p51 is responsible for silencing suppressor activity. Silencing suppressor activity of R78 is conserved in three divergent MCDV strains (MCDV-Severe, MCDV-M1, and MCDV-Tennessee), as well as the waikavirus Bellflower vein <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> virus, but was not detected for orthologous protein of Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV-A) or the similarly-positioned protein from the sequivirus Parsnip yellow fleck virus (PYFV). This is the first identification of a virus suppressor of RNA silencing encoded by a waikavirus.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phosphorus (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize P with high efficiency. To investigate the effects of iron (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of Fe in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different P efficiency, the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing Fe concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The Fe reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total Fe uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more iron was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="trait">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by Fe deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased Fe concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active Fe in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable Fe concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean is caused by a soilborne pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme. Phytotoxins produced by F. virguliforme are translocated from infected roots to leaves, in which they cause SDS foliar symptoms. In this study, additional putative phytotoxins of F. virguliforme were identified, including three secondary metabolites and 11 effectors. While citrinin, fusaric acid, and radicicol induced foliar <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and wilting, Soybean mosaic virus (SMV)-mediated overexpression of F. virguliforme necrosis-inducing secreted protein 1 (FvNIS1) induced SDS foliar symptoms that mimicked the development of foliar symptoms in the field. The expression level of fvnis1 remained steady over time, although foliar symptoms were delayed compared with the expression levels. SMV::FvNIS1 also displayed genotype-specific toxicity to which 75 of 80 soybean cultivars were susceptible. Genome-wide association mapping further identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms at two loci, where three leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) genes were found. Culture filtrates of fvnis1 knockout mutants displayed a mild reduction in phytotoxicity, indicating that FvNIS1 is one of the phytotoxins responsible for SDS foliar symptoms and may contribute to the quantitative susceptibility of soybean by interacting with the <span class="gene">LRR-RLK</span> genes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Iron deficiency <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> (IDC) is a <span class="trait">yield</span> limiting problem in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) production regions with calcareous soils. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using a high density SNP map to discover significant markers, QTL and candidate genes associated with IDC trait variation. A stepwise regression model included eight markers after considering LD between markers, and identified seven major effect QTL on seven chromosomes. Twelve candidate genes known to be associated with iron metabolism mapped near these QTL supporting the polygenic nature of IDC. A non-synonymous substitution with the highest significance in a major QTL region suggests soybean orthologs of FRE1 on <span class="gene">Gm03</span> is a major gene responsible for trait variation. NAS3, a gene that encodes the enzyme nicotianamine synthase which synthesizes the iron chelator nicotianamine also maps to the same QTL region. Disease resistant genes also map to the major QTL, supporting the hypothesis that pathogens compete with the plant for Fe and increase iron deficiency. The markers and the allelic combinations identified here can be further used for marker assisted selection.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In a survey of candidate genes located in the salinity tolerance locus of soybean, we identified a putative glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene <span class="gene">(GmGSTL1)</span> which was up-regulated in response to salt treatment. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this putative <span class="gene">GST</span> belongs to the Lambda class, a plant-specific group with unknown functions. We expressed <span class="gene">GmGSTL1</span> in heterologous systems, including tobacco BY-2 cells and Arabidopsis thaliana, to test its ability to protect the cell/plant against salinity stress. Compared with the control, we observed a marked reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in transgenic cells under salt treatment, and their survival rate was also improved. Similarly, expression of <span class="gene">GmGST1</span> in transgenic A. thaliana also alleviated stress symptoms under salt treatment. To address further the possible protective mechanisms of <span class="gene">GmGSTL1,</span> we identified two candidate flavonoid interactants (quercetin and kaemferol) of the <span class="gene">GmGSTL1</span> protein from soybean leaf extract. Exogenous application of quercetin could reduce salinity-induced ROS accumulation in BY-2 cells and leaf <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> in A. thaliana.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], iron deficiency results in interveinal <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and decreased photosynthetic capacity, leading to stunting and <span class="trait">yield</span> loss. In this study, gene expression analyses investigated the role of soybean replication protein A (RPA) subunits during iron stress. Nine RPA homologs were significantly differentially expressed in response to iron stress in the near isogenic lines (NILs) Clark (iron efficient) and Isoclark (iron inefficient). RPA homologs exhibited opposing expression patterns in the two NILs, with RPA expression significantly repressed during iron deficiency in Clark but induced in Isoclark. We used virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) to repress <span class="gene">GmRPA3</span> expression in the iron inefficient line Isoclark and mirror expression in Clark. <span class="gene">GmRPA3-silenced</span> plants had improved IDC symptoms and chlorophyll content under iron deficient conditions and also displayed stunted growth regardless of iron availability. RNA-Seq comparing gene expression between <span class="gene">GmRPA3-silenced</span> and empty vector plants revealed massive transcriptional reprogramming with differential expression of genes associated with defense, immunity, aging, death, protein modification, protein synthesis, photosynthesis and iron uptake and transport genes. Our findings suggest the iron efficient genotype Clark is able to induce energy controlling pathways, possibly regulated by SnRK1/TOR, to promote nutrient recycling and stress responses in iron deficient conditions.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The molecular chaperone binding protein (BiP) participates in the constitutive function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and protects the cell against stresses. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which BiP protects plant cells from stress-induced cell death. We found that enhanced expression of BiP in soybean (Glycine max) attenuated ER stress- and osmotic stress-mediated cell death. Ectopic expression of BiP in transgenic lines attenuated the leaf necrotic lesions that are caused by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin and also maintained shoot turgidity upon polyethylene glycol-induced dehydration. BiP-mediated attenuation of stress-induced cell death was confirmed by the decreased percentage of dead cell, the reduced induction of the senescence-associated marker gene <span class="gene">GmCystP,</span> and reduced DNA fragmentation in BiP-overexpressing lines. These phenotypes were accompanied by a delay in the induction of the cell death marker genes N-RICH PROTEIN-A (NRP-A), NRP-B, and <span class="gene">GmNAC6,</span> which are involved in transducing a cell death signal generated by ER stress and osmotic stress through the NRP-mediated signaling pathway. The prosurvival effect of BiP was associated with modulation of the ER stress- and osmotic stress-induced NRP-mediated cell death signaling, as determined in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines with enhanced (sense) and suppressed (antisense) BiP levels. Enhanced expression of BiP prevented NRP- and NAC6-mediated <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and the appearance of senescence-associated markers, whereas silencing of endogenous BiP accelerated the onset of leaf senescence mediated by NRPs and <span class="gene">GmNAC6.</span> Collectively, these results implicate BiP as a negative regulator of the stress-induced NRP-mediated cell death response.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Iron is a necessary but often limiting nutrient for plant growth and development. Soybeans grown on the high-pH calcareous soils are especially prone to developing iron deficiency <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and suffering the resultant <span class="trait">yield</span> losses. Once iron is transported into the root, it must be translocated from the root to the shoot where it is needed for photosynthesis and other processes. Previous work has indicated that iron is likely to move through the xylem as ferric citrate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, citrate is effluxed into the xylem by the ferric reductase defective3 (FRD3) protein. Here, we present the identification and characterization of two soybean genes, <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> and <span class="gene">GmFRD3b,</span> with similar sequence and function to AtFRD3. The expression of both <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> and <span class="gene">GmFRD3b</span> is induced by iron deficiency in the iron-efficient reference cultivar Williams 82. <span class="gene">GmFRD3b,</span> but not <span class="gene">GmFRD3a,</span> is expressed at higher levels in the iron-efficient cultivar Clark than in its iron-inefficient near isogenic line iso-Clark (iso), likely accounting for the higher xylem citrate levels in Clark. Increased xylem citrate levels lead to increased solubility of ferric iron in Clark xylem exudate as compared to iso-Clark exudate. These results support the hypothesis that high xylem citrate levels are needed for efficient root to shoot translocation of iron. Along with efficient ferric chelate reductase activity and root iron uptake activity, high expression levels of FRD3 genes are also proposed as a target for future iron efficiency breeding projects.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To determine the relationship between nodulation restriction by the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele of soybean, rhizobitoxine-induced <span class="trait">chlorosis,</span> and taxonomic grouping of bradyrhizobia, 119 bradyrhizobial isolates were tested in Leonard jar culture for nodulation response and <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> induction. In addition to strain USDA 61, the strain originally reported as defining the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> response, eight other isolates (i.e., USDA 62, 83, 94, 238, 252, 259, 260, and 340) were discovered to elicit the nodulation interdiction of the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele. Only 16% of all the bradyrhizobial strains tested induced <span class="trait">chlorosis,</span> but seven of the nine strains (78%) interdicted by the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele were chlorosis-inducing strains. Furthermore, in tests for antibiotic <span class="trait">resistance</span> profile, eight of the nine interdicted strains (89%) were classed in DNA homology group II. This evidence suggests that the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele has a positive value to the host plant in shielding it from nodulation by certain chlorosis-inducing bradyrhizobia of a DNA homology group with impaired efficiency of nitrogen fixation with soybean.

Further introgression mapping of near isogenic lines of the major locus on <span class="gene">Gm03</span> identified two soybean orthologs of the subgroup lb <italic> basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH </italic> ) genes which are known to regulate the iron deficiency response genes in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6"> 6 </xref> . A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study of IDC using advanced soybean breeding lines detected a group of loci harboring gene homologs involved in iron uptake and transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11"> 11 </xref> , indicating a powerful tool of GWA study in dissecting genetic basis of complex trait. GWA analysis using a natural, diverse population has been repeatedly shown to be an efficient way to discover novel genetic variants of traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12"> 12 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13"> 13 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14"> 14 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15"> 15 </xref> , which is critical to create cultivars with robust and durable <span class="trait">resistance</span> to biotic or abiotic stresses. However, the natural genetic variants of IDC tolerance of the USDA soybean germplasm collection remain unexplored.

						Genome-wide association analyses were conducted using both the ML-classification based IDC score (also called ML-score) and the severity (also called ML-severity) of the V5-V6 growth stage. GWA analyses identified 19 and 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the ML-score and ML-severity, respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"> Fig. 1 </xref> ). Among them, 17 SNPs were common and tagged to a region of 847&#x02009;kb on <span class="gene">Gm03.</span> All significant SNPs were finally clustered into seven QTL associated with soybean IDC <span class="trait">resistance</span> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1"> Table 1 </xref> ). Three loci, <italic> ss715583665 </italic> <span class="gene">(Gm02),</span> <italic> ss715585452 </italic> (or <italic> ss715585486 </italic> ) on <span class="gene">Gm03,</span> and <italic> ss715585473 </italic> <span class="gene">(Gm03),</span> were associated with both traits. The <italic> ss715585452 </italic> alone contributed 8.0&#x02013;9.1% of the total phenotypic variation, representing the largest effect locus in the present study. Notably, <italic> ss715585452 </italic> and <italic> ss715585473 </italic> were 173&#x02009;kb apart on <span class="gene">Gm03</span> (Table1). Further investigation indicated that these two loci were in coupling phase in 62% (288) of the association panel and 37% (171) were in favorable allelic combination ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Fig. S2 </xref> ).

						Consistent with the complexity of the genetic architecture of the region on <span class="gene">Gm03</span> as revealed above, multiple genes related to iron metabolism were identified within this region. Two of them, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma.03g130400</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma.03g130600</span> </italic> (also known as <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma03g28610</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma03g28630,</span> </italic> respectively) encode <italic> bHLH </italic> transcript factors. Their expressions were root specific and iron stress inducible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6"> 6 </xref> . Another candidate gene, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma.03g128300</span> </italic> , putatively encodes a ferredoxin-dependent GLUS and primarily expresses in leaf and stem. Loss function of its homolog in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> results in leaf <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org"> http://www.arabidopsis.org </ext-link> ). The fourth candidate gene is <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma.03g129200</span> </italic> . It is highly expressed in root hair and is proposed to encode a cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> protein containing a domain that interacts selectively and non-covalently with iron ions ( <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phytozome.net"> https://phytozome.net </ext-link> ).

						The major QTL on <span class="gene">Gm03</span> was not detected in previous GWA studies for IDC where 132 and 138 advanced soybean breeding lines, developed by public and private breeding programs adapted to the north-central states of the US, were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11"> 11 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"> 24 </xref> . The identification of the major QTL in these studies may have been prevented due to rare allele because elite by elite crosses are common for soybean cultivar development, and the <span class="trait">resistance</span> allele of the QTL in older elite cultivars was likely fixed as illustrated in this study, especially for those grown in north-central US. However, the persistence of large <span class="trait">yield</span> losses caused by IDC suggests the necessity to explore novel genetic variants for soybean IDC tolerance improvement.
