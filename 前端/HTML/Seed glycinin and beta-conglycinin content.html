				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared to β-conglycinin, <span class="trait">glycinin</span> contains 3-4 times the methionine and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of <span class="trait">glycinin.</span> These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy protein is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the acidic (A) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit, and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, soy proteins were reduced with 0.1-10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to obtain an increasing number of sulphydryl groups (SH) with a similar particle size. Aggregation was promoted by increasing the degree of reduction when heated (100°C, 30min), resulting in larger sized aggregates (from 40 to 70nm) and a higher viscosity of the aggregate dispersion. The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of acidic (A) polypeptide of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation. The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on protein aggregates formation.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits of <span class="trait">beta-conglycinin</span> was suppressed by sequence-mediated gene silencing in transgenic soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> The resulting seeds had similar total oil and protein <span class="trait">content</span> and ratio compared with the parent line. The decrease in <span class="trait">beta-conglycinin</span> protein was apparently compensated by an increased accumulation of <span class="trait">glycinin.</span> In addition, proglycinin, the precursor of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> was detected as a prominent polypeptide band in the protein profile of the transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> extract. Electron microscopic analysis and immunocytochemistry of maturing transgenic soybean seeds indicated that the process of storage protein accumulation was altered in the transgenic line. In normal soybeans, the storage proteins are deposited in pre-existing vacuoles by Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, in transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> with reduced <span class="trait">beta-conglycinin</span> levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles were observed that resembled precursor accumulating-vesicles of pumpkin seeds and the protein bodies accumulated by cereal seeds. Their ER-derived membrane of the novel vesicles did not contain the protein storage vacuole tonoplast-specific protein alpha-TIP, and the sequestered polypeptides did not contain complex glycans, indicating a preGolgi and nonvacuolar nature. <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> was identified as a major component of these novel protein bodies and its diversion from normal storage protein trafficking appears to be related to the proglycinin buildup in the transgenic <span class="trait">seed.</span> The stable accumulation of proteins in a protein body compartment instead of vacuolar accumulation of proteins may provide an alternative intracellular site to sequester proteins when soybeans are used as protein factories.
