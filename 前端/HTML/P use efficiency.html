				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low phosphorus <span class="trait">(P)</span> availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and <span class="trait">P</span> content, respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

Combining linkage analysis, genome-wide and candidate-gene association analyses, and plant transformation, we identified a soybean gene related to <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> determined its favorable haplotypes and developed valuable functional markers. First, six major genomic regions associated with <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> were detected by performing genome-wide associations (GWAs) in various environments. A highly significant region located on chromosome 8, qPE8, was identified by both GWAs and linkage mapping and explained 41% of the phenotypic variation. Then, a regional mapping study was performed with 40 surrounding markers in 192 diverse soybean accessions. A strongly associated haplotype <span class="trait">(P</span> = 10(-7)) consisting of the markers Sat_233 and BARC-039899-07603 was identified, and qPE8 was located in a region of approximately 250 kb, which contained a candidate gene <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> that encoded an acid phosphatase. <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> overexpression in soybean hairy roots increased <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by 11-20% relative to the control. A candidate-gene association analysis indicated that six natural <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> polymorphisms explained 33% of the phenotypic variation. The favorable alleles and haplotypes of <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> associated with increased transcript expression correlated with higher enzyme activity. The discovery of the optimal haplotype of <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> will now enable the accurate selection of soybeans with higher <span class="trait">P</span> efficiencies and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in plants.

						Phosphorus <span class="trait">(P)</span> is essential for all living cells and organisms, and low-P stress represents a major constraint on plant growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> worldwide. Soybean is an important economical resource of protein and oil for human and animals, and soybean is also a high-P demand species that is sensitive to low-P stress, which is considered a major constraint on soybean production. However, <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> is an important complex quantitative trait involving multiple genes, and the mechanisms underlying soybean <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> are largely unknown. Here, we reported the construction of a high-density genetic map using a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) strategy in soybean. This map, spanning 3020.59 cM in length, contained 6159 markers on 20 chromosomes, with an average distance of 0.49 cM between adjacent markers. Based on this map, 20 loci, including eight novel loci, associated with <span class="trait">P</span> efficiency-related traits were identified across multiple years and treatments. The confidence intervals of almost all QTLs were refined significantly, and the accuracy of this map was evidenced by coincident detections of the previously identified <span class="trait">P</span> efficiency-related genes <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> and <span class="gene">GmPT1.</span> Notably, a highly significant novel QTL located on chromosome 4, q4-2, was identified across traits, years and treatments. Several candidate genes, such as a pectin methylesterase-encoding gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.04G214000)</span> and a protein kinase gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.13G161900),</span> with significantly differential expression upon low-P stress were considered as promising candidates involved in regulating soybean <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> Markers that tightly associated with <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> could be used for marker-assisted selection in a soybean <span class="trait">P</span> efficient breeding program. Further, dissection of these QTLs will facilitate gene cloning underlying <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in soybean, and increase our understanding of efficient <span class="trait">use</span> of <span class="trait">P</span> in enhancing crop <span class="trait">yield.</span>

						Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing the Arabidopsis purple acid phosphatase gene AtPAP15 (OXp) or the soybean expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> (OXe) can improve phosphorous <span class="trait">(P)</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in pure culture by increasing Apase secretion or changing root morphology. In this study, soybean-soybean mixed cultures were employed to illuminate <span class="trait">P</span> acquisition among plants in mixed stands of transgenic and wild-type soybean. Our results showed that transgenic soybean plants were much more competitive, and had greater growth and <span class="trait">P</span> uptake than wild-type soybean in mixed culture in both low <span class="trait">P</span> calcareous and acid soils. Furthermore, OXe plants had an advantage in calcareous soils when mixed with OXp, whereas the latter performed much better in acid soils. In soybean-maize mixed culture, transgenic soybean had no impact on maize growth compared to controls in both acid and calcareous soils with different <span class="trait">P</span> conditions. As for soybean in mixed culture, OXp plants had no significant advantages regardless of <span class="trait">P</span> availability or soil type, while <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> improved in OXe in calcareous soils compared to controls. These results imply that physiological traits could be easily affected by the mixed maize. Transgenic soybean plants with enhanced root traits had more competitive advantages than those with improved root physiology in mixed culture.

						KEY MESSAGE: Both in vitro and in vivo hairy root transformation systems could not replace whole plant transformation for promoter analysis of root-specific and low-P induced genes in soybean. An efficient genetic transformation system is crucial for promoter analysis in plants. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most popular method to produce transgenic hairy roots or plants. In the present study, first, we compared the two different Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root transformation methods using either constitutive CaMV35S or the promoters of root-preferential genes, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> and <span class="gene">GmPAP21,</span> in soybean, and found the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of in vitro hairy root transformation was significantly higher than that of in vivo transformation. We compared Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated whole plant transformation systems. The results showed that low-phosphorous <span class="trait">(P)</span> inducible <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> and <span class="gene">GmPAP21</span> promoters could not induce the increased expression of the GUS reporter gene under low <span class="trait">P</span> stress in both in vivo and in vitro transgenic hairy roots. Conversely, GUS activity of <span class="gene">GmPAP21</span> promoter was significantly higher at low <span class="trait">P</span> than high <span class="trait">P</span> in whole plant transformation. Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo hairy root transformation systems could not replace whole plant transformation for promoter analysis of root-specific and low-P induced genes in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A 2-year field experiment was conducted in 2011 and 2012 to investigate the effects of phosphorus <span class="trait">(P)</span> fertilization on the leaf area index (LAI), dry matter accumulation (DMA), and <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (PUE) of maize in wheat/maize/soybean intercropping system. Five <span class="trait">P</span> fertilization rates were installed, i.e., 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg P2O5 x hm(-2) for wheat, marked as WP0, WP1, WP2, WP3, and WP4, respectively, and 0, 37.5, 75, 112.5, and 150 kg P2O5 x hm(-2) for maize, marked as MP0, MP1, MP2, MP3, and MP4, respectively. During the coexisted growth periods of wheat and maize, <span class="trait">P</span> fertilization increased the LAI, leaf area duration (LAD), and stem and leaf DMA of maize significantly. After the jointing stage of maize, the maize LAI, LAD, DMA, and crop growth rate (CGR) all decreased after an initial increase with the increasing <span class="trait">P</span> rate, with the maximum growth in treatment <span class="gene">MP2</span> or MP3. During the reproductive stage of maize, the maize dry mass translocation from vegetative to reproductive organ increased with increasing <span class="trait">P</span> fertilization rate, and the grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of both maize and whole cropping system increased firstly and decreased then, with the maximum grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of maize and whole cropping system being 6588 and 11955 kg x hm(-2) in treatment P3, respectively. The <span class="trait">P</span> apparent recovery <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of maize was the highest (26.3%) in treatment MP2, being 82.6%, 38.4%, and 152.9% higher than that in MP1 (14.4%), MP3 (19.0%), and MP4 (10.4%), respectively. In sum, for the wheat/maize/soybean intercropping system, applying appropriate amount of <span class="trait">P</span> fertilizer could promote maize growth, alleviate the impact of wheat on maize, and consequently, increase the <span class="trait">P</span> apparent recovery <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of maize. In this study, the appropriate <span class="trait">P</span> fertilization rate was 75-112.5 kg P2O5 x hm(-2).

						BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in the phosphate <span class="trait">(P)</span> uptake of many important crop species, but the mechanisms that control their <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and their contribution to the <span class="trait">P</span> nutrition of the host plant are only poorly understood. METHODS: The <span class="trait">P</span> uptake and growth potential of two soybean genotypes that differ in their root architectural traits and <span class="trait">P</span> acquisition <span class="trait">efficiency</span> were studied after colonization with different AM fungi and the transcript levels of plant <span class="trait">P</span> transporters involved in the plant or mycorrhizal <span class="trait">P</span> uptake pathway were examined. KEY RESULTS: The mycorrhizal growth responses of both soybean genotypes ranged from highly beneficial to detrimental, and were dependent on the <span class="trait">P</span> supply conditions, and the fungal species involved. Only the colonization with Rhizophagus irregularis increased the growth and <span class="trait">P</span> uptake of both soybean genotypes. The expression of <span class="gene">GmPT4</span> was downregulated, while the mycorrhiza-inducible <span class="trait">P</span> transporter <span class="gene">GmPT10</span> was upregulated by colonization with R. irregularis Colonization with both fungi also led to higher transcript levels of the mycorrhiza-inducible <span class="trait">P</span> transporter <span class="gene">GmPT9,</span> but only in plants colonized with R. irregularis were the higher transcript levels correlated to a better <span class="trait">P</span> supply. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that AM fungi can also significantly contribute to the <span class="trait">P</span> uptake and growth potential of genotypes with a higher <span class="trait">P</span> acquisition <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> but that mycorrhizal <span class="trait">P</span> benefits depend strongly on the <span class="trait">P</span> supply conditions and the fungal species involved.

						Understanding the variability of plant WUE and its control mechanism can promote the comprehension to the coupling relationship of water and carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystem, which is the foundation for developing water-carbon coupling cycle model. In this paper, we made clear the differences of net assimilation rate, transpiration rate, and WUE between the two species by comparing the experiment data of soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) plants under water and soil nutrient stresses. WUE of maize was about two and a half times more than that of soybean in the same weather conditions. Enhancement of water stresses led to the marked decrease of Am and <span class="gene">Em</span> of two species, but water stresses of some degree could improve WUE, and this effect was more obvious for soybean. WUE of the two species changed with psiL in a second-order curve relation, and the WUE at high fertilization was higher than that at low fertilization, this effect was especially obvious for maize. Moreover, according to the synthetic model of photosynthesis-transpiration based on stomatal behavior (SMPTSB) presented by Yu et al. (2001), the WUE model and its applicability were discussed with the data measured in this experiment. The WUE estimated by means of the model accorded well with the measured values. However, this model underestimated the WUE for maize slightly, thus further improvement on the original model was made in this study. Finally, by discussing some physiological factors controlling Am and WUE, we made clear the physiological explanation for differences of the relative contributions of stomata- and mesophyll processes to control of Am and WUE, and the applicability of WUE model between the two species. Because the requirement to stomatal conductance by unit change of net assimilation rate is different, the responses of opening-closing activity of stomata to environmental stresses are different between the two species. To obtain the same level of net assimilation rate, soybean has to open its stomata more widely to keep small stomatal <span class="trait">resistance,</span> as compared with maize.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sheep raising in the state of Guerrero, México, is a primary activity that is worth about US$3,251,931 annually. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical composition, degradability, nutrient intake, and animal performance of Pelibuey lambs fed on different combinations of maize-soybean silages. Twenty-one combinations of maize silage (MS) and soybean silage (SS) were evaluated at day 45 post-ensiling; in each combination, <span class="gene">MS</span> was replaced by 5 % of SS. The 21 combinations were analysed for crude protein (CP) and chemical composition. In order to obtain a statistical criterion of potential treatments for the animal feeding test, a cluster analysis was performed based on the CP contents of all combinations at day 45 post-ensiling. From cluster analysis, four treatments were selected T1 = 100-0 % (MS/SS), T8 = 65-35 %, T12 = 45-55 %, and T16 = 25-75 %. Results indicated that cluster analysis was useful for identifying the potential treatments for animal feeding based on the crude protein content. The dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) contents did not declined significantly <span class="trait">(P</span> &gt; 0.05) during the fermentation of silages but CP content decreased from day 0 to 45 post-ensiling. The treatment with the highest estimated microbial crude protein synthesis was T8 and it showed the highest metabolizable energy intake, high feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> with a forage-concentrate ratio of 84:16.

						Plant productivity relies on photosynthesis, and the photosynthetic process relies on phosphorus <span class="trait">(P).</span> The genetic basis of photosynthesis and <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (PE) affecting <span class="trait">yield</span> has been separately characterized in various crop plants. However, the genetic relationship between PE and photosynthesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used a combined analysis of phenotypic correlation, linkage mapping, and expression analysis to dissect the relationship between PE and photosynthesis. We found significant phenotypic correlations between PE and photosynthetic related traits, particularly under low <span class="trait">P</span> stress. A total of 172 QTLs for both traits were detected and classified into 29 genomic regions. 12 (41.4%) of 29 regions were detected to be associated with both PE and photosynthetic related traits. Three major QTLs, q14-2, q15-2, and q19-2, were found to be associated with both traits and explained 6.6-58.9% of phenotypic variation. A photosynthetic-specific QTL cluster, q12-1, was detected under both normal and low <span class="trait">P</span> conditions, suggesting that genes responsible for this region were less effected by low <span class="trait">P</span> stress, and could be used in high photosynthetic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> breeding programs. In addition, several candidate genes with significantly differential expression upon low <span class="trait">P</span> stress, such as a purple acid phosphatase gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.19G193900)</span> within q19-2 region, were considered as promising candidates involved in regulating both soybean PE and photosynthetic capacity. Our results reveal a significant genetic relationship between PE and photosynthetic traits, and uncover several major genomic regions specific or common to these traits. The markers linked closely to these major QTLs may be used for selection of soybean varieties with improved <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and photosynthetic capacity.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Legume root nodules convert atmospheric nitrogen gas into ammonium through symbiosis with a prokaryotic microsymbiont broadly called rhizobia. Auxin signaling is required for determinant nodule development; however, the molecular mechanism of auxin-mediated nodule formation remains largely unknown. Here, we show in soybean (Glycine max) that the microRNA miR167 acts as a positive regulator of lateral root organs, namely nodules and lateral roots. miR167c expression was up-regulated in the vasculature, pericycle, and cortex of soybean roots following inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110 (the microsymbiont). It was found to positively regulate nodule numbers directly by repressing the target genes <span class="gene">GmARF8a</span> and <span class="gene">GmARF8b</span> (homologous genes of Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana] AtARF8 that encode auxin response factors). Moreover, the expression of miR167 and its targets was up- and down-regulated by auxin, respectively. The miR167-GmARF8 module also positively regulated nodulation <span class="trait">efficiency</span> under low microsymbiont density, a condition often associated with environmental stress. The regulatory role of miR167 on nodule initiation was dependent on the Nod factor receptor <span class="gene">GmNFR1α,</span> and it acts upstream of the nodulation-associated genes nodule inception, nodulation signaling pathway1, early nodulin40-1, <span class="gene">NF-YA1</span> (previously known as HAEM activator protein2-1), and NF-YA2. miR167 also promoted lateral root numbers. Collectively, our findings establish a key role for the miR167-GmARF8 module in auxin-mediated nodule and lateral root formation in soybean.

						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including phosphorus <span class="trait">(P),</span> iron (Fe) and water deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::GmEXPB2-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and <span class="trait">P</span> uptake, especially at low <span class="trait">P</span> levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and <span class="trait">P</span> uptake at both low and high <span class="trait">P</span> levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by Fe and mild water deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including <span class="trait">P,</span> Fe and water deficiency. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and <span class="trait">P</span> responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop <span class="trait">P</span> uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.

						An experiment using 336 Hy-Line W-36 Single Comb White Leghorn hens was conducted to evaluate transgenic soybeans containing the gm-fad2-1 gene fragment and the gm-hra gene. Transcription of the gm-fad2-1 gene fragment results in an increased level of oleic acid (18:1) in the seed, and expression of the soybean acetolactate synthase protein <span class="gene">(GM-HRA)</span> encoded by the modified gm-hra gene, is used as a selectable marker during transformation. Pullets (20 wk of age) were placed in cage lots (7 hens/cage, 2 cages/lot) and were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 corn-soybean meal dietary treatments (6 lots/treatment) formulated with the following soybean meals: nontransgenic near-isoline control (control), nontransgenic commercial reference soybean meal A (92M72), nontransgenic commercial reference soybean meal B (93B15), or transgenic soybean meal produced from soybeans containing event DP-3Ø5423-1 (305423). Weeks 20 to 24 were a preconditioning period, and the 4 experimental diets were then fed from 25 to 36 wk of age. Differences between the 305423 and control group means were evaluated, with statistical significance at <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.05. Body weight, hen-day egg production, egg mass, feed consumption, and feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> for hens fed the 305423 soybean meal were not significantly different from the respective values for hens fed diets formulated with the near-isoline soybean meal. Likewise, egg component weights, Haugh unit measures, and egg weights were similar regardless of the soybean meal source. This research indicates that performance of hens fed diets containing 305423 soybean meal, as measured by egg production and egg quality, was similar to that of hens fed diets formulated with the near-isoline control and commercial soybean meals.

						Conventional Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation often produces a significant frequency of transgenic events containing vector backbone sequence, which is generally undesirable for biotechnology applications. We tested methods to reduce the frequency of transgenic plants containing vector backbone by incorporating genes into the backbone that inhibit the development of transgenic plants. Four backbone frequency reduction genes, bacterial levansucrase (sacB), maize cytokinin oxidase (CKX), Phaseolus GA 2-oxidase (GA 2-ox), and bacterial phytoene synthase (crtB), each expressed by the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter, were placed individually in a binary vector backbone near the left border (LB) of binary vectors. In transformed soybean plants, the lowest frequency of backbone presence was observed when the constitutively expressed CKX gene was used, followed by crtB. Higher backbone frequencies were found among the plants transformed with the GA 2-oxidase and <span class="gene">sacB</span> vectors. In some events, transfer of short backbone fragments appeared to be caused by LB readthrough and termination within the backbone reduction gene. To determine the effect of the backbone genes on transformation frequency, the <span class="gene">crtB</span> and CKX vectors were then compared to a control vector in soybean transformation experiments. The results revealed that there was no significant transformation frequency difference between the <span class="gene">crtB</span> and control vectors, but the CKX vector showed a significant transformation frequency decrease. Molecular analysis revealed that the frequency of transgenic plants containing one or two copies of the transgene and free of backbone was significantly increased by both the CKX and <span class="gene">crtB</span> backbone reduction vectors, indicating that there may be a correlation between transgene copy number and backbone frequency.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A novel formulation based on nanovesicles system for rapid-onset sublingual delivery of hydrophilic drug (sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate, STS) was investigated. The nanovesicles system was composed of 1.5% soybean lecithin, 6% propylene glycol, and penetration enhancers (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.03% hyaluronan acid). The STS-loaded nanovesicles with an average diameter of 133 ± 9.04 nm and high entrapment <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of 85.65 ± 3.89% were characterized. The effects of permeation enhancers on the penetration of <span class="gene">STS</span> formulations were investigated using Franz diffusion cells in vitro, showing 86.1-235.8 times higher permeation rate than that of normal <span class="gene">STS</span> solution. The rapid symptom relief effect of the nanovesicles system on acute myocardial infarction rabbits was evaluated by in vivo study, ST-segment deviation(S and T wave abnormality in electrocardiogram) was attenuated markedly and rapidly within 5 min, infarct size of heart was significantly reduced and the biochemical indicators were substantially decreased, compared with the control groups <span class="trait">(p</span> &lt; 0.05). This study provided a promising tool for the future sublingual delivery of hydrophilic compounds with the noninvasive and rapid onset clinical effect.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nitrogen (N) balance was determined in 36 pigs (BW 24 to 30 kg) fed diets inducing different ileal endogenous N losses (ENL). We tested the hypothesis that enhanced <span class="gene">ENL</span> may be indicative of a higher recycling of endogenous proteins that will induce a greater urinary N loss and a lower <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of the dietary N utilization for retention. The cornstarch-based diets contained either soy concentrate (SC), soybean meal (SBM), a mixture of toasted and untoasted soybean meal (mSBM), dehulled-toasted rapeseed cake (RC1), non-dehulled-toasted rapeseed cake (RC2), or dehulled-untoasted rapeseed cake (RC3). The diets were balanced for their content of apparent ileal digestible (ID) CP (108 g/kg feed) and apparent ID of Lys, Thr, Met+Cys, Trp, and Ile. Feeding level was 2.7 times ME for maintenance per kilogram BWx75 and restricted to 88% of the requirements for ID Lys as the first-limiting amino acid. During a 5-d period, urine and feces were collected daily in metabolism cages. Compared with the SC diet (low ENL), the diets with SBM (medium ENL) and mSBM (high ENL) resulted in a greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; .05) urinary N excretion. Nitrogen retention tended to be less <span class="trait">(P</span> = .08) in pigs fed diets that caused greater ENL. The utilization of ID N for retention in pigs fed the mSBM diet was lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; .05) than for those fed the SC diet. There were no differences in urinary N excretion, N retention, and the utilization of ID N for retention in pigs fed the rapeseed diets of different fiber contents (hulls as the NDF source). We concluded that, at similar intakes of the first-limiting ID amino acid, N retention in pigs fed soybeans tended to be reduced by greater <span class="gene">ENL</span> as induced by antinutritional factors (e.g., trypsin inhibitors). Rapeseed hulls, as the predominant fiber source, do not affect N retention and the utilization of ID N for retention.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Lectins are known to bind to the intestinal brush border membrane and induce antinutritional effects such as disruption of the brush border membrane (BBM) and reduced nutrient digestibility in laboratory rodents. Because soybean lectin (SBL) is usually present in poult starter diets, 2 similar experiments with starting turkey poults were conducted to investigate the effects of purified SBL on growth performance and nutrient digestibility. Experimental diets were a corn starch-casein based control (lectin-free) semipurified diet (PD), semipurified diets containing 0.024 or 0.048% soybean lectin (PDL, PDH), and a corn-soybean meal diet (SBD). Experimental diets were fed from hatch to 14 d. Antibodies specific for soybean lectin were detected in the serum of poults fed the PDL and <span class="gene">PDH</span> diets, implying that the SBL in these diets remained active in the digestive tract. Poults fed the control PD or SBD grew equally well. The 0.024% SBL level in PDL had no significant detrimental effect on any parameters assessed in the 2 experiments. In contrast, the 0.048% SBL level in the <span class="gene">PDH</span> gave inconsistent results for feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (FE) and brush border enzyme levels. For instance, on d 6 in experiment 2, poults fed the <span class="gene">PDH</span> had poorer FE <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) compared with the control PD treatment, but had similar FE to poults fed the PD in experiment 1. In conclusion, SBL present at levels up to 0.024% of the diet would not cause antinutritional effect in turkey poults up to 2 wk of age.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of inclusion of whole-crop pea (WCP) silages, differing in condensed tannin content, as a substitute for grass silage (GS) and soybean meal on lamb metabolism, performance, plasma metabolites, digestibility, and carcass characteristics. In both experiments lambs were offered either solely <span class="gene">GS</span> or a 50:50 mix on a DM basis of <span class="gene">GS</span> with either low-tannin (LTPS) or high-tannin (HTPS) pea silage ad libitum. Each forage mix was fed with either 400 g/d of low-protein (LP) concentrate or 400 g/d of LP with an additional 200 g/d of pelletized soybean meal (HP), resulting in 6 dietary treatments. Experiment 1 examined the effects of the diets on metabolism, digestibility, and N balance using 6 lambs in 4 periods of 21 d in an incomplete crossover design. Experiment 2 used 48 lambs and examined the effects of the diets on ADG, plasma metabolites, and carcass characteristics over 56 d. Both experiments were analyzed using a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. In Exp. 1, lambs offered the LTPS diets had a greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) digestibility of DM and OM than those offered the <span class="gene">GS</span> diets. Lambs offered the WCP silages had an increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) N intake, N output, and digestibility of GE compared with those offered GS. Mean N digestibility was greatest <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) in lambs offered LTPS. Lambs offered HP diets had increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.001) digestibility of DM, OM, GE and N, and N- intake, output, retention, and digestibility compared with those offered the LP diets. In Exp. 2, there was no effect <span class="trait">(P</span> &gt; 0.05) of forage type on intake, slaughter BW, or feed conversion <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (FCE). However, lambs offered the LTPS had a greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) ADG than those offered the <span class="gene">GS</span> diets. Feeding diets containing HP increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.001) total DMI, slaughter BW, ADG, and FCE. Lambs offered the WCP had a greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and urea concentration compared with those offered the <span class="gene">GS</span> diets. Feeding lambs HP diets increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) plasma urea and total protein. Forage mix had no effect <span class="trait">(P</span> &gt; 0.05) on carcass composition except for fat depth, which was greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) in lambs offered WCP silage. Diets containing the HP increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) carcass weight, hind leg circumference, chop dimensions, and kidney weight. It was concluded that lambs offered LTPS performed better than those offered <span class="gene">GS</span> and that LTPS has a concentrate sparing effect. Additionally, the increased tannin concentration in HTPS did not increase performance over lambs offered either <span class="gene">GS</span> or LTPS.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In vivo and in vitro 3 x 2 factorial experiments were conducted concurrently to evaluate the incorporation of 0, 15, or 30% sugar beet pulp (SBP) as an energy source in diets fed to growing Holstein steers with either soybean meal (SBM) or alcohol-treated, defatted soybean flakes (ATSBF) as primary supplemental protein sources. Three groups of 42 Holstein steers each were fed six different diets from 54 kg initial BW to 320 kg in three experimental periods. There were no overall <span class="gene">SBP</span> level x protein source interactions <span class="trait">(P</span> greater than .05). Beet pulp level tended to decrease ADG (linear, <span class="trait">P</span> = .05) and increase feed/gain (linear, <span class="trait">P</span> less than .05) and DMI (quadratic, <span class="trait">P</span> less than .05). Each grower diet was used in a substrate for ruminal microbial metabolism in six dual-flow, continuous-culture fermenters. Organic matter and carbohydrate digestion were similar <span class="trait">(P</span> greater than .05) among diets. Increasing dietary levels of <span class="gene">SBP</span> caused a concomitant increase <span class="trait">(P</span> less than .05) in acetate and decrease <span class="trait">(P</span> less than .05) in butyrate and isobutyrate concentrations. Beet pulp level x protein source interactions <span class="trait">(P</span> less than .05) were observed for CP degradation, ammonia and nonammonia N, and dietary N flow. Crude protein degradation was higher <span class="trait">(P</span> less than .05) for the 0% <span class="gene">SBP</span> with SBM diet (81.3%) than for the 30% <span class="gene">SBP</span> with ATSBF diet (64.4%). <span class="trait">Efficiency</span> of bacterial synthesis was similar <span class="trait">(P</span> greater than .05) among diets. Results indicated that <span class="gene">SBP</span> is an effective dietary energy source for high-energy grower diets at 15 or 30% of the DM but may cause a decrease in some performance traits. There were no nutritional benefits of using ATSBF vs SBM as the supplemental N source.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effect of humidity on the gas exchange of leaves of the dicotyledons soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (L.) Schneider), and saltbush (Atriplex halimus L.) and the monocotyledons wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) was examined under conditions of adequate soil moisture in a controlled environment. Photosynthesis and stomatal and internal diffusion resistances of whole, attached, single leaves were not affected by changes in humidity as the vapour pressure deficit between the leaf and atmosphere ranged from 8 to 27 mb. Transpiration increased linearly with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Whole plants of barley exhibited a different response. As humidity was increased, photosynthesis increased, transpiration expressed per unit of vapour pressure difference increased, and diffusion resistances became smaller. Reasons for the different behaviour of single leaves and whole plants are suggested. An index for water <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> expressed per millibar of vapour pressure deficit, was calculated for single leaves of each species used in the experiments. This showed that water <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> was highest in the <span class="gene">C4</span> xerophytes and lowest in the <span class="gene">C3</span> mesophytes. The effect of environment on water <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> is examined using data from the literature.

						Soybean is a high phosphorus <span class="trait">(P)</span> demand species that is sensitive to low-P stress. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) for <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> have been identified in soybean, but few of these have been cloned and agriculturally applied mainly due to various limitations on identifying suitable <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> candidate genes. Here, we combined QTL mapping, transcriptome profiling, and plant transformation to identify candidate genes underlying QTLs associated with low-P tolerance and response mechanisms to low-P stress in soybean. By performing QTL linkage mapping using 152 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that were derived from a cross between a P-efficient variety, Nannong 94-156, and P-sensitive Bogao, we identified four major QTLs underlying <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> Within these four QTL regions, 34/81 candidate genes in roots/leaves were identified using comparative transcriptome analysis between two transgressive RILs, low-P tolerant genotype B20 and sensitive B18. A total of 22 phosphatase family genes were up-regulated significantly under low-P condition in B20. Overexpression of an acid phosphatase candidate gene, <span class="gene">GmACP2,</span> in soybean hairy roots increased <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by 15.43-24.54 % compared with that in controls. Our results suggest that integrating QTL mapping and transcriptome profiling could be useful for rapidly identifying candidate genes underlying complex traits, and phosphatase-encoding genes, such as <span class="gene">GmACP2,</span> play important roles involving in low-P stress tolerance in soybean.

						A coating procedure based on the physical adsorption of hydroxypropyl cellulose onto the wall of a capillary column has been successfully used for the separation of DNA fragments up to 500 bp. The method uses a running Tris-phosphate-EDTA buffer containing 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose as sieving polymer. The separation procedure shows good reproducibility (measured as RSD%) for consecutive runs (&lt;0.64), for different days (&lt; 1.15) and capillaries (&lt;2.15), short analysis times, and a long coating lifetime. Good reproducibility and <span class="trait">efficiency</span> are even achieved by performing the separation in the presence of additives such as ethidium bromide and mannitol. The method is applied to the detection of <span class="gene">GMOs</span> in soybean and maize meals with an accurate evaluation of the length of DNA sequences, previously amplified by polymerase chain reaction.

						Phosphorus (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize <span class="trait">P</span> with high <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> To investigate the effects of iron (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of Fe in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing Fe concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The Fe reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total Fe uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more iron was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="trait">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by Fe deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased Fe concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active Fe in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable Fe concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Glutathione transferases (GSTs) from the tau class (GSTU) are unique to plants and have important roles in stress tolerance and the detoxification of herbicides in crops and weeds. A fluorodifen-induced <span class="gene">GST</span> isoezyme <span class="gene">(GmGSTU4-4)</span> belonging to the tau class was purified from Glycine max by affinity chromatography. This isoenzyme was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and its structural and catalytic properties were investigated. The structure of <span class="gene">GmGSTU4-4</span> was determined at 1.75 A resolution in complex with S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione (Nb-GSH). The enzyme adopts the canonical <span class="gene">GST</span> fold but with a number of functionally important differences. Compared with other plant GSTs, the three-dimensional structure of <span class="gene">GmGSTU4-4</span> primarily shows structural differences in the hydrophobic substrate binding site, the linker segment and the C-terminal region. The X-ray structure identifies key amino acid residues in the hydrophobic binding site (H-site) and provides insights into the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. The isoenzyme was highly active in conjugating the diphenylether herbicide fluorodifen. A possible reaction pathway involving the conjugation of glutathione with fluorodifen is described based on site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies. A serine residue (Ser13) is present in the active site, at a position that would allow it to stabilise the thiolate anion of glutathione and enhance its nucleophilicity. Tyr107 and Arg111 present in the active site are important structural moieties that modulate the catalytic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and specificity of the enzyme, and participate in k(cat) regulation by affecting the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction. A hitherto undescribed ligand-binding site (L-site) located in a surface pocket of the enzyme was also found. This site is formed by conserved residues, suggesting it may have an important functional role in the transfer and delivery of bound ligands, presumably to specific protein receptors.

						The biological utilization of DL-methionine (MET), DL-methionine-hydroxy-analog and DL-S-methyl-methionine-sulphonium-chloride (SMM) was tested in rat growth assay. Weight gain, feed <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> protein <span class="trait">efficiency</span> ratio (PER), net protein ratio (NPR) and net protein utilization (NPU) were applied as criteria. A test diet containing soybean meal as sole protein source was fortified with MET, MHA or SMM at 1.5 and 3.0 g/kg levels, respectively. All fortifications had a significant <span class="trait">(p</span> &lt; 0.05) positive influence on weight gain, feed conversion and protein utilization. SMM showed the highest activity. <span class="gene">MET</span> and MHA were almost equally well utilized at 3.0 g/kg fortification level, however MHA proved slightly less efficient at 1.5 g/kg level than MET.

						A potential mechanism to enhance utilization of sparingly soluble forms of phosphorus <span class="trait">(P)</span> is the root secretion of malate, which is mainly mediated by the ALMT gene family in plants. In this study, a total of 34 <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> genes were identified in the soybean genome. Expression patterns diverged considerably among <span class="gene">GmALMTs</span> in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in leaves, roots and flowers, with expression altered by <span class="trait">P</span> availability in 26 of the 34 <span class="gene">GmALMTs.</span> One root-specific <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean <span class="trait">P</span> nutrition. Analysis of <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots. Furthermore, both growth and <span class="trait">P</span> content of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external <span class="trait">P</span> source. Taken together, these results indicate that members of the soybean <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> gene family exhibit diverse responses to Pi starvation. One member of this family, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> might contribute to soybean <span class="trait">P</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble <span class="trait">P</span> sources under <span class="trait">P</span> limited conditions.

						Quantification of genetically modified organisms <span class="gene">(GMOs)</span> in food and feed products is often required for their labelling or for tolerance thresholds. Standard-curve-based simplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the prevailing technology, which is often combined with screening analysis. With the rapidly growing number of <span class="gene">GMOs</span> on the world market, qPCR analysis becomes laborious and expensive. Innovative cost-effective approaches are therefore urgently needed. Here, we report the development and inter-laboratory assessment of multiplex assays to quantify <span class="gene">GMO</span> soybean using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The assays were developed to facilitate testing of foods and feed for compliance with current <span class="gene">GMO</span> regulations in the European Union (EU). Within the EU, the threshold for labelling is 0.9% for authorised <span class="gene">GMOs</span> per ingredient. Furthermore, the EU has set a technical zero tolerance limit of 0.1% for certain unauthorised <span class="gene">GMOs.</span> The novel multiplex ddPCR assays developed target 11 <span class="gene">GMO</span> soybean lines that are currently authorised, and four that are tolerated, pending authorisation in the EU. Potential significant improvements in cost <span class="trait">efficiency</span> are demonstrated. Performance was assessed for the critical parameters, including limits of detection and quantification, and trueness, repeatability, and robustness. Inter-laboratory performance was also determined on a number of proficiency programme and real-life samples.

						The large-dimensional and rigid ceramic bulks fabricated by high-temperature solid-phase reaction and sintering have never been considered for possibly entering and circulating within the blood vessels for biomedical applications, especially on combating cancer. Here, it is reported for the first time that MAX ceramic biomaterials exhibit unique functionalities for dual-mode photoacoustic/computed tomography imaging and are highly effective for in vivo photothermal ablation of tumors upon being exfoliated into ultrathin nanosheets within atomic thickness (MXene). As a paradigm, 2D ultrathin tantalum carbide nanosheets (Ta4 <span class="gene">C3</span> MXenes) with nanosized lateral sizes are successfully synthesized based on a two-step liquid exfoliation strategy of MAX phase Ta4 AlC3 by combined hydrofluoric acid (HF) etching and probe sonication. The structural, electronic, and surface characteristics of the as-exfoliated nanosheets are revealed by various characterizations combined with first-principles calculations via density functional theory. Especially, the superior photothermal-conversion performance <span class="trait">(efficiency</span> η of 44.7%) and in vitro/in vivo photothermal ablation of tumor by biocompatible soybean phospholipid-modified Ta4 <span class="gene">C3</span> nanosheets are systematically revealed and demonstrated. Based on the large family members of MXenes, this work may offer a paradigm that MXenes can achieve the specific biomedical applications (here, theranostic) providing that their compositions and nanostructures are carefully tuned and optimized to meet the strict requirements of biomedicine.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The efficacy of corn expressing an Escherichia coli-derived gene (corn-based phytase; CBP) and an E. coli-derived microbial phytase (expressed in Pichia pastoris) sprayed onto a wheat carrier (Quantum) was comparatively evaluated in two 14-d broiler chicken studies. In experiment 1, a total of 288 seven-day-old male broiler chicks were grouped by weight into 8 blocks of 6 cages, with 6 birds per cage, and used to measure growth performance, bone mineralization, and nutrient utilization. In experiment 2, a total of 192 seven-day-old male broiler chicks were used, with 4 birds per cage. Six dietary treatment groups were randomly allotted to the cages within each of 8 blocks. The corn-soybean meal-based diets used in each study consisted of a positive control adequate in <span class="trait">P</span> and Ca; a negative control (NC) low in <span class="trait">P</span> and Ca (no added inorganic <span class="trait">P);</span> the NC supplemented with 3,630, 36,300, or 363,000 phytase units (FTU) of CBP/kg; and the NC + 3,630 FTU of Quantum/kg. Growth performance and bone mineralization criteria were reevaluated in the second broiler study. Data from the 2 experiments were combined because there was no diet x experiment interaction and analyzed as a randomized complete block design. Weight gain decreased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) with a reduction in dietary <span class="trait">P</span> and Ca in the NC diet. Weight gain, feed <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> and percentage of tibia ash of birds fed 3,630 FTU/kg of either <span class="gene">CBP</span> or Quantum phytase were not different. There was a quadratic response <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) to <span class="gene">CBP</span> supplementation of the NC diets in weight gain of the broiler chicks. Feed intake increased quadratically <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) with <span class="gene">CBP</span> supplementation of the NC diets, but <span class="gene">CBP</span> supplementation of the NC diets did not affect feed <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> Tibia ash of birds fed the positive control diet was greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) than that of birds fed the NC diet. There was a quadratic response <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) to <span class="gene">CBP</span> supplementation of the NC diets in tibia ash of the broiler chicks. Birds fed supplemental phytase had greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) ileal and total tract <span class="trait">P</span> and Ca digestibility than birds fed the NC diet. Data from the study suggest that E. coli phytase expressed in corn is efficacious in P-deficient broiler chick diets for the improvement of growth performance and indices of <span class="trait">P</span> utilization, which would minimize the need for supplemental <span class="trait">P</span> in broiler diets.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of supplemental dietary fat on total lactation energy intake and sow and litter performance during high ambient temperatures (27 ± 3°C). Data were collected from 337 mixed-parity sows from July to September in a 2,600-sow commercial unit in Oklahoma. Diets were corn-soybean meal-based with 7.5% corn distillers dried grains with solubles and 6.0% wheat middlings and contained 3.24 g of standardized ileal digestible Lys/Mcal of ME. Animal-vegetable fat blend (A-V) was supplemented at 0, 2, 4, or 6%. Sows were balanced by parity, with 113, 109, and 115 sows representing parity 1, 2, and 3 to 7 (P3+), respectively. Feed disappearance (subset of 190 sows; 4.08, 4.18, 4.44, and 4.34 kg/d, for 0, 2, 4, and 6%, respectively; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.05) and apparent caloric intake (12.83, 13.54, 14.78, and 14.89 Mcal of ME/d, respectively; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.001) increased linearly with increasing dietary fat. Gain:feed (sow and litter BW gain relative to feed intake) was not affected <span class="trait">(P</span> = 0.56), but gain:Mcal ME declined linearly with the addition of A-V (0.16, 0.15, 0.15, and 0.14 for 0, 2, 4, and 6%, respectively; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Parity 1 sows (3.95 kg/d) had less <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) feed disappearance than P2 (4.48 kg/d) and P3+ (4.34 kg/d) sows. Body weight change in <span class="gene">P1</span> sows was greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) than either P2 or P3+ sows (-0.32 vs. -0.07 and 0.12 kg/d), whereas backfat loss was less <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) and loin depth gain was greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) in P3+ sows compared with <span class="gene">P1</span> and P2 sows. Dietary A-V improved litter ADG <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05; 1.95, 2.13, 2.07, and 2.31 kg/d for 0, 2, 4, and 6% fat, respectively) only in P3+ sows. Sows bred within 8 d after weaning (58.3, 72.0, 70.2, and 74.7% for 0, 2, 4, and 6%, respectively); conception rate (78.5, 89.5, 89.2, and 85.7%) and farrowing rate (71.4, 81.4, 85.5, and 78.6%) were improved <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) by additional A-V, but weaning-to-breeding interval was not affected. Rectal and skin temperature and respiration rate of sows were greater <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.002) when measured at wk 3 compared with wk 1 of lactation, but were not affected by A-V addition. Parity 3+ sows had lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) rectal temperature than <span class="gene">P1</span> and P2 sows, and respiration rate was reduced <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.001) in <span class="gene">P1</span> sows compared with P2 and P3+ sows. In conclusion, A-V improved feed disappearance and caloric intake, resulting in improved litter weight gain and subsequent reproductive performance of sows; however, feed and caloric <span class="trait">efficiency</span> were negatively affected.

						The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein sources and roughage (R) to concentrate (C) ratio on in vitro fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. The experimental design was a 2×5 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design (CRD). Factor A was 2 levels of protein sources yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) and soybean meal (SBM) and factor B was 5 levels of roughage to concentrate (R:C) ratio at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, and 0:100, respectively. Rice straw was used as a roughage source. It was found that gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) of YEFECAP supplemented group was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than those in SBM supplemented group. Moreover, the intercept value (a), gas production from the insoluble fraction (b), gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c), potential extent of gas production (a+b) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were influenced (p&lt;0.01) by R:C ratio. In addition, protein source had no effect (p&gt;0.05) on ether in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic (IVOMD) while R:C ratio affected the IVDMD and IVOMD (p&lt;0.01). Moreover, YEFECAP supplanted group showed a significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) total VFA and <span class="gene">C3</span> while C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production were decreased when compared with SBM supplemented group. In addition, a decreasing R:C ratio had a significant effect (p&lt;0.05) on increasing total VFA, <span class="gene">C3</span> and NH3-N, but decreasing the C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production (p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus populations in YEFECAP supplemented group were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than those in the SBM supplemented group while fungal zoospores, methanogens and protozoal population remained unchanged (p&gt;0.05) as compared between the two sources of protein. Moreover, fungal zoospores and total bacteria population were significantly increased (p&lt;0.01) while, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, methanogens and protozoal population were decreased (p&lt;0.01) with decreasing R:C ratio. In conclusion, YEFECAP has a potential for <span class="trait">use</span> as a protein source for improving rumen fermentation <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in ruminants.

						The aim of this study was to compare the effect of DL-selenomethionine (SM) with 2 routinely used Se sources, sodium selenite (SS) and seleno-yeast (SY), on relative bioavailability based on antioxidant activity and tissue Se content. Six hundred thirty 131-day-old brown laying hens were randomly assigned to 7 treatments for 168 d (24 wks) with 6 replicates of 15 hens per replicate. The <span class="gene">SS</span> and SY animals were supplemented a cornmeal and soybean diet that supplied a total Se 0.3 mg/kg whereas SM was added at 4 different levels to the total Se at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mg/kg. All hens fed the Se-supplemented diet showed higher glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01), higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05), lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) in plasma, and greater Se contents in egg yolks, albumen, leg muscle, breast muscle, liver, and plasma compared with those fed the control diet <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01). The organic sources (SY and SM) exhibited a greater ability to increase the GSH-Px activity <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) and Se content in albumen <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01), leg, and breast muscles <span class="trait">(P</span> = 0.0099 and <span class="trait">P</span> = 0.0014, respectively) than the <span class="gene">SS</span> that was added at 0.3 mg Se/kg. The higher SM added levels increased the GSH-Px activity until the dose of 0.5mg Se/kg <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01).The greater Se concentrations in albumen, muscle and liver appeared in the higher SM-added level, as well as above the dose of 0.1 mg Se/kg <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01). In addition, hens fed the diet with SM accumulated more Se in albumen, leg, and breast muscle than those fed diets with SY <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05). These results confirmed the higher ability of organic Se sources to increase the antioxidant activity and Se deposition in egg albumen, leg, and breast muscles compared with SS, and demonstrated a significantly better <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of SM compared with SY for albumen and muscle Se enrichment.

						The effects of varying dietary fat saturation [butter (B), beef tallow (BT)] or polyunsaturation [(n-6) soybean oil (SBO), (n-3) menhaden oil (MO)] and cholesterol content (0.05 and 0.5 g/100 g) on systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma lipids and tissue antioxidant status were investigated in 14-wk-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Varying dietary fat composition for 9 wk had no influence on <span class="gene">SBP</span> in either SHR or WKY rats. Rats fed MO diets exhibited smaller <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) body weight gains, lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> ratios and lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) plasma cholesterol concentrations than those fed the B, BT and SBO diets. Significant <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) interactions for animal strain x cholesterol intake and animal strain x fat source were noted for serum cholesterol concentrations. SHR exhibited higher <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) RBC and liver catalase (CAT), and heart and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities similar to those of WKY rats. The lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt;0.01) RBC, heart and liver glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities observed in SHR coincided with higher <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt;0.01) glutathione reductase (GSSG-Red), compared with WKY rats. Dietary cholesterol intake had no effect on RBC, heart and liver total sulfhydryl concentration or GSH-Px activities, but increased <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt;0. 001) liver GSSG-Red. Feeding MO resulted in lower <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt;0.001) RBC and heart GSH-Px activities. In contrast, feeding B and BT resulted in lower GSH-Px in liver. The significant <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01) animal strain x fat source interaction obtained for liver GSH-Px activity indicated that SHR responded differently to polyunsaturated fatty acid feeding than their WKY counterparts. Diet-induced changes in tissue antioxidant status were tissue specific and did not affect the development of hypertension in SHR.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effects of fiber inclusion, feed form, and energy concentration of the diet on the growth performance of pullets from hatching to 5 wk age were studied in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, there was a control diet based on cereals and soybean meal, and 6 extra diets that included 2 or 4% of cereal straw, sugar beet pulp (SBP), or sunflower hulls (SFHs) at the expense (wt/wt) of the whole control diet. From hatching to 5 wk age fiber inclusion increased (P&lt;0.05) ADG and ADFI, and improved (P&lt;0.05) energy <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (EnE; kcal AMEn/g ADG), but body weight (BW) uniformity was not affected. Pullets fed SFH tended to have higher ADG than pullets fed <span class="gene">SBP</span> (P=0.072) with pullets fed straw being intermediate. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was better (P&lt;0.05) with 2% than with 4% fiber inclusion. In Experiment 2, 10 diets were arranged as a 2×5 factorial with 2 feed forms (mash vs. crumbles) and 5 levels of AMEn (2,850, 2,900, 2,950, 3,000, and 3,050 kcal/kg). Pullets fed crumbles were heavier and had better FCR than pullets fed mash (P&lt;0.001). An increase in the energy content of the crumble diets reduced ADFI and improved FCR linearly, but no effects were detected with the mash diets (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05 for the interactions). Feeding crumbles tended to improve BW uniformity at 5 wk age (P=0.077) but no effects were detected with increases in energy concentration of the diet. In summary, the inclusion of moderate amounts of fiber in the diet improves pullet performance from hatching to 5 wk age. The response of pullets to increases in energy content of the diet depends on feed form with a decrease in feed intake when fed crumbles but no changes when fed mash. Feeding crumbles might be preferred to feeding mash in pullets from hatching to 5 wk age.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This research studied the effects of additional fiber in the rearing phase diets on egg production, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) traits, and body measurements of brown egg-laying hens fed diets varying in energy concentration from 17 to 46 wk of age. The experiment was completely randomized with 10 treatments arranged as a 5 × 2 factorial with 5 rearing phase diets and 2 laying phase diets. During the rearing phase, treatments consisted of a control diet based on cereals and soybean meal and 4 additional diets with a combination of 2 fiber sources (cereal straw and sugar beet pulp, SBP) at 2 levels (2 and 4%). During the laying phase, diets differed in energy content (2,650 vs. 2,750 kcal AMEn/kg) but had the same amino acid content per unit of energy. The rearing diet did not affect any production trait except egg production that was lower in birds fed <span class="gene">SBP</span> than in birds fed straw (91.6 and 94.1%, respectively; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Laying hens fed the high energy diet had lower feed intake <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.001), better feed conversion <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.01), and greater BW gain <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05) than hens fed the low energy diet but egg production and egg weight were not affected. At 46 wk of age, none of the GIT traits was affected by previous dietary treatment. At this age, hen BW was positively related with body length (r = 0.500; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.01), tarsus length (r = 0.758; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.001), and body mass index (r = 0.762; <span class="trait">P</span> &lt; 0.001) but no effects of type of diet on these traits were detected. In summary, the inclusion of up to 4% of a fiber source in the rearing diets did not affect GIT development of the hens but <span class="gene">SBP</span> reduced egg production. An increase in the energy content of the laying phase diet reduced ADFI and improved feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> but did not affect any of the other traits studied.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <span class="trait">use</span> of analytical controls is essential when performing <span class="gene">GMO</span> detection through screening tests. Additionally, the presence of taxon-specific sequences is analyzed mostly for quality control during <span class="gene">GMO</span> detection. In this study, 11 commonly used genetic elements involving three promoters (P-35S, P-FMV35S and P-NOS), four marker genes (Bar, NPTII, HPT and Pmi), and four terminators (T-NOS, T-35S, T-g7 and T-e9), together with the reference gene fragments from six major crops of maize, soybean, rapeseed, rice, cotton and wheat, were co-integrated into the same single plasmid to construct a general reference plasmid pBI121-Screening. The suitability test of pBI121-Screening plasmid as reference material indicated that the non-target sequence on the pBI121-Screening plasmid did not affect the PCR amplification efficiencies of screening methods and taxon-specific methods. The sensitivity of screening and taxon-specific assays ranged from 5 to 10 copies of pBI121-Screening plasmid, meeting the sensitivity requirement of <span class="gene">GMO</span> detection. The construction of pBI121-Screening solves the lack of a general positive control for screening tests, thereby reducing the workload and cost of preparing a plurality of the positive control.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The study was to determine effects of dietary supplementation of chitosan (COS) and galacto-mannan-oligosaccharides <span class="gene">(GMOS)</span> on some serum biochemical indices, serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels, and hepatic and long gissimus muscle IGF-I mRNA expression in early-weaned piglets. Twenty six Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets at the age of 15 days were used. The piglets had access to creep feed during the suckling. Six piglets were sacrificed for sampling at the beginning of the study. The other 20 piglets were individually housed in metabolic cages and randomly allotted to four corn and soybean meal-based diets including the control group, the antibiotic group with 110 mg lincomycin/kg diet, the COS group containing 0.025% COS, and the <span class="gene">GMOS</span> group with 0.20% <span class="gene">GMOS,</span> respectively, in a 2-week feeding experiment. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was reduced whereas serum total protein concentration was increased (P&lt;0.05) in responses to the COS and <span class="gene">GMOS</span> supplementation. Dietary supplementation of COS and <span class="gene">GMOS</span> also increased (P&lt;0.05) the serum GH and IGF-I levels along with enhanced hepatic and the muscle IGF-I mRNA abundance. Dietary supplementation of oligosaccharides such as COS and <span class="gene">GMOS</span> may improve growth and feed conversion <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by increasing plasma GH and IGF-I levels, in the early-weaned piglets.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A previous study showed that supplementing broilers with an oil byproduct obtained during the purification process of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) from safflower oil could result in CLA-enriched egg yolks more efficiently than feeding purified CLA (free fatty acid form). On this basis, this study evaluated whether dietary CLA byproduct (CBP) supplementation would enhance CLA accumulation in broiler muscle and its lipogenic mRNA expression in the liver. A total of 456 1-day-old male broiler chicks were randomly assigned to four groups, each of which was given one of the following 2% dietary supplements for 4 weeks: soybean oil (control), safflower oil (SAF), purified CLA, and CBP. During the feeding trial, little alteration in broiler performance was observed among the test groups. CLA accumulation <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in the breast muscle did not differ significantly between the CLA- and CBP-fed groups after feeding of the test diet for 3 weeks. CLA supplementation also induced lipogenesis in the livers of the broilers, and it significantly increased the relative mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), as well as its target genes: fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) <span class="trait">(p</span> &lt; 0.05). However, in the CBP-fed group, SREBP1 and ACC mRNA levels were not significantly different from the controls <span class="trait">(p</span> &gt; 0.05). These results suggest that <span class="gene">CBP</span> could be an efficient dietary source that promotes CLA accumulation in broiler muscle without inducing lipogenesis in the liver or compromising performance and meat quality in the birds.

						The design of screening methods for the detection of genetically modified organisms <span class="gene">(GMOs)</span> in food would improve the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in their control. We report here a PCR amplification method combined with a sequence-specific electrochemical genosensor for the quantification of a DNA sequence characteristic of the 35S promoter derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). Specifically, we employ a genosensor constructed by chemisorption of a thiolated capture probe and p-aminothiophenol gold surfaces to entrap on the sensing layer the unpurified PCR amplicons, together with a signaling probe labeled with fluorescein. The proposed test allows for the determination of a transgene copy number in both hemizygous (maize MON810 trait) and homozygous (soybean GTS40-3-2) transformed plants, and exhibits a limit of quantification of at least 0.25% for both kinds of <span class="gene">GMO</span> lines.

						Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased as lyophilized desalted powder from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Leuven, Belgium). Their sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00881-t001"> Table 1 </xref> . The commercially supplied disulfide-modified capture probes were treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and then purified by elution through a Sephadex G25 column (NAP-10, GE Healthcare, Madrid, Spain) to <span class="trait">yield</span> the respective thiolated oligonucleotides as described elsewhere [ <xref rid="B13-sensors-17-00881" ref-type="bibr"> 13 </xref> ]. All oligonucleotide stock solutions were aliquoted and diluted to convenient concentrations (GENESYS <sup> TM </sup> 10S UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific, Madrid, Spain) and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. <italic> <span class="trait">p</span> </italic> -Aminothiophenol ( <italic> <span class="trait">p</span> </italic> -ATP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), DTT, 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in a ready-to-use format (K-blue enhanced activity substrate, including H <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 2 </sub> ), concentrated saline sodium phosphate-EDTA (20&#x000d7; SSPE) pH 7.4 and phosphate buffer saline (10&#x000d7; PBS) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain) and used without further purification. 1% casein blocking solution in PBS was acquired from Thermo Scientific. Fab fragments from polyclonal anti-fluorescein antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-FITC-HRP) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics <span class="gene">GmbH</span> (Mannheim, Germany). DNA intercalating dye EvaGreen <sup> &#x000ae; </sup> (20&#x000d7;, Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA) and ROX reference dye (50&#x000d7;, Invitrogen, Madrid, Spain) were used for real-time fluorescence-based PCR monitoring. All other reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. Unless otherwise stated, aqueous solutions were prepared using high purity deionized water (18 M&#x003a9;&#x000b7;cm resistivity) produced with a Milli-Q System (Direct-Q <sup> &#x000ae; </sup> , Millipore Corporation, Madrid, Spain).

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from 100 mg of homogenized flour using the Nucleospin <sup> &#x000ae; </sup> food kit (Macherey-Nagel, D&#x000fc;ren, Germany), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with minor modifications as described in Reference [ <xref rid="B14-sensors-17-00881" ref-type="bibr"> 14 </xref> ]. All extractions included a blank for controlling potential contamination during the procedure. UV spectrophotometry (Cary 60 Agilent including a mirrored ultramicrovolume cuvette cap) was used to evaluate the purity of extracts (A <sub> 260 </sub> /A <sub> 280 </sub> ratio around 1.8) and to determine DNA concentration. To ensure the quality of the extracted DNA for PCR amplification, the chloroplast <span class="gene">rbcL</span> gene was amplified as a universal control for plants [ <xref rid="B15-sensors-17-00881" ref-type="bibr"> 15 </xref> ]. DNA extracts (100 ng/&#x000b5;L) were aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C until <span class="trait">use,</span> minimizing repetitive freeze-thaw cycles to protect sample integrity.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						From these analyses, PCR <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (E) can also be calculated according to the equation: <disp-formula> E = (10 <sup> &#x02212;1/slope </sup> ) &#x02212; 1 </disp-formula> and expressed in percentage (%). A value of 104% was obtained, which is in agreement with the European Network of <span class="gene">GMO</span> Laboratories (ENGL) acceptance criteria for q-PCR (slope between &#x02212;3.6 and &#x02212;3.1, corresponding to amplification efficiencies of 90 and 110%, respectively) [ <xref rid="B19-sensors-17-00881" ref-type="bibr"> 19 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The proposed method combining PCR with an electrochemical genosensor for the detection of the regulatory element CaMV35S has analytical performance that allows its <span class="trait">use</span> for the control of the compliance with the current EU legislation on <span class="gene">GMOs</span> (the LOQ is clearly below the threshold value established by law). Furthermore, unlike our prior reported work that couples this electrochemical hybridization assay with a helicase-dependent isothermal DNA amplification [ <xref rid="B14-sensors-17-00881" ref-type="bibr"> 14 </xref> ], this methodology allows not only Yes/No detection of <span class="gene">GMOs</span> but also quantification of the 35S promoter, widely used in the constructs inserted in GM crops.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding blends of grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins on performance, hematology, metabolism, and immunological parameters of turkeys. The efficacy of polymeric glucomannan mycotoxin adsorbent <span class="gene">(GMA)</span> in preventing these adverse effects was also evaluated. Three hundred 1-d-old male turkey poults were fed wheat-, corn-, and soybean meal-based starter (0 to 3 wk), grower (4 to 6 wk), developer (7 to 9 wk), and finisher (10 to 12 wk) diets formulated with uncontaminated grains, contaminated grains, and contaminated grains + 0.2% <span class="gene">GMA.</span> Feeding contaminated grains significantly decreased BW gains during the grower and developer phases, and <span class="gene">GMA</span> supplementation prevented these effects. There was no effect of diet, however, on feed intake or feed <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> The feeding of contaminated grains reduced total lymphocyte counts at wk 3 <span class="trait">(P</span> &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation with <span class="gene">GMA</span> increased plasma total protein concentrations compared with controls and birds fed the contaminated diet. Plasma uric acid concentrations in birds fed contaminated grains were increased at the end of the experiment compared with controls, and the feeding of <span class="gene">GMA</span> prevented this effect. Feeding contaminated grains significantly increased the percentage of CD4(+) lymphocyte populations during wk 6; however, there was no change in the percentage of CD8(+) and B-lymphocyte populations. Contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene, which is a CD8(+) T cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity response, was significantly decreased after 24 and 72 h by feedborne mycotoxins compared with controls. Supplementation of the contaminated diet with <span class="gene">GMA</span> prevented the decrease in response after 24 h. Secondary antibody (IgG titer) response against SRBC antigens (CD4(+) T cell-dependent) was significantly decreased after feeding contaminated grains compared with controls. It was concluded that turkey performance and some blood and immunological parameters were adversely affected by feedborne Fusarium mycotoxins, and <span class="gene">GMA</span> prevented many of these effects.

						Recently, some differences between USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> and USDA 6 <sup> T </sup> in their hydrogenase genes have been pointed out [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> ]. Now, having the genomes of CPAC 15 and CPAC 7, we can confirm the information available [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> ] and expand it by showing that differences in hydrogenase expression are observed at the species level. All four strains have genes encoding hydrogenase in the symbiosis island, more specifically, <italic> hupA(=S)B(=L)CDFH, hypABFDE </italic> . However, some of the genes are duplicated and incomplete, or are pseudogenes, such as <italic> <span class="gene">hupD</span> </italic> . The region is flanked by transposases that are also positioned between genes. Therefore, the operons might not be functional and may have gone through an evolutionary process of gene loss. Only in both <italic> B. diazoefficiens </italic> strains there are hydrogenase genes in other chromosomal loci, represented by almost identical genes to <italic> hupNCUVSLCDFGHIJ </italic> , <italic> hypKABFCDE </italic> and <italic> hoxXA </italic> with 98% to 100% gene similarity. In CPAC 7, these genes were also in a genomic island as in USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> ]. On the other hand, in <italic> B. japonicum </italic> , the only remaining gene in this region was <italic> <span class="gene">hupN</span> </italic> (BJ6T_24840 in USDA 6 <sup> T </sup> and BS01414 in CPAC 15). Indeed, a Hup <sup> - </sup> phenotype has been reported for CPAC 15, while CPAC 7 showed a Hup <sup> + </sup> phenotype [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14"> 14 </xref> ] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media"> 1 </xref> : Table S5). In conclusion, the functional hydrogen-uptake system is located in a genomic island distinct from the symbiosis island. The effects of a functional uptake hydrogenase can thus go much further than the reported benefits in the improvement in the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of N <sub> 2 </sub> fixation.

						Both strains had a transporter for D-methionine (operon <italic> metQIN </italic> ), a general L-amino acid transporter (operon <italic> aapJQMP </italic> ) and a branched-chain amino acid transporter (operon <italic> livKHMGF </italic> ), critical for the biological N <sub> 2 </sub> -fixation process. Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides are responsible for various processes related to bacterial growth and survival. In both genomes, ribose transporter proteins RbsB, RbsC, RbsA were found, and in addition, monosacharides may be transported by other proteins, such as GruA (present in both genomes), an analogue of the protein AraG (subunit of L-arabinose ABC transporter). In relation to oligosaccharides transporters, the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (UgpC, UgpA, UgpE) was present in both strains. A multiple sugar transporter (ChvE, GguB, GguA) was also present in both strains and, interestingly, <italic> <span class="gene">chvE</span> </italic> has been suggested as related to the higher <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of N <sub> 2 </sub> fixation in variants of CPAC 15 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57"> 57 </xref> ]. Within the group of the ABC-2 transporters, both strains had transporters of antibiotics ( <italic> yadH </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">yadG</span> </italic> ), lipo-oligosaccharide ( <italic> <span class="gene">nodJ</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">nodI</span> </italic> ), lipoproteins ( <italic> lolC </italic> , <italic> lolE </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">lolD</span> </italic> ) and cell-division-related transporters ( <italic> <span class="gene">ftsX</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">ftsE</span> </italic> ).

						Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-cell communication mechanism that allows bacteria to regulate gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density and to coordinate group behaviors [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97"> 97 </xref> &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99"> 99 </xref> ]. In general, QS in Gram-negative bacteria is mediated by N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-signaling molecules, which are synthesized by LuxI protein homologs from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and acylated acyl-carrier proteins (acyl-ACPs). The LuxR transcriptional regulators bind to cognate HSL autoinducers to activate gene transcription of QS-target genes. QS has recently been linked to several important symbiosis features, including nodulation <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> symbiosome development, EPS production and N <sub> 2 </sub> fixation [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98"> 98 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99"> 99 </xref> ]. Approximately 22% (31 of 142) of the <italic> B. japonicum </italic> and <italic> B. elkanii </italic> strains tested produced AHLs that induced moderate to elevated levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity with an <italic> Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic> biosensor [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100"> 100 </xref> ]. Both Bj CPAC 15 and Bd CPAC 7 strains each contain a <italic> luxI </italic> -type synthase, identified as BS04783 and BU02130, respectively, showing over 95% of identity to BjaI protein (blr1063) of USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> and with USDA 6 <sup> T </sup> (BJ6T_10890). Adjacent to these ORFs, there is in both genomes a <italic> <span class="gene">luxR</span> </italic> -type regulator (BS04784 and BU02129), also with high identity (&#x0003e;94%) to BjaR (blr1062) of USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> and with USDA 6 <sup> T </sup> (BJ6T_10880). Neither gene is in any of the genomic islands. According to Lindemann [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101"> 101 </xref> ], BjaI and BjaR proteins of USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> are responsible for the synthesis of the QS signal, a branched-chain fatty acyl-HSL, isovaleryl-HSL (IV-HSL). Similar molecules may be synthesized by other strains.

						It is noteworthy that Boddey &#x00026; Hungria [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14"> 14 </xref> ] reported that the capacity for synthesis of IAA <italic> in vitro </italic> by CPAC 15 is greater (31.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) in comparison to CPAC 7, USDA 110 <sup> T </sup> and USDA 123 (13.12, 6.85 and 4.88&#x02009;&#x003bc;M, respectively), what could be explained by the higher number of ORFs detected in CPAC 15. This feature should be explored more thoroughly, as the <span class="trait">use</span> of <italic> Bradyrhizobium </italic> as plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) of non-legumes has been suggested [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129"> 129 </xref> ]. The delivery of phytohormones straight to plants is suggested by the findings that <italic> Bradyrhizobium </italic> is found as an endophyte of non-legumes, such as wild rice ( <italic> Oryza breviligulata </italic> ) in Senegal and Guinea [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130"> 130 </xref> ] and sugarcane ( <italic> Saccharum </italic> spp.) in Brazil [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131"> 131 </xref> ]. Therefore, the study of elite <italic> Bradyrhizobium </italic> strains, such as CPAC 15, may have important implications beyond the symbiosis with soybean. Contributions of <italic> Bradyrhizobium </italic> to the N-nutrition of non-legumes is also worth investigating given recent findings of bradyrhizobial <italic> <span class="gene">nifH</span> </italic> transcripts inside sugarcane [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132"> 132 </xref> ].

						Using computer-assisted gel-image analysis software, well-defined spots were detected and the majority of their molecular weights ranged between 14&#x000a0;kDa and 97&#x000a0;kDa (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1 </xref> ). Among these, 150 spots were selected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF <span class="gene">MS</span> or, when necessary, by MS/MS. Mass spectra of peptide fragments were compared with database entries, regarding the statistical requirements, and 115 spots were successfully identified, representing 95 different proteins (Tables&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ).

						The current results showed that <italic> <span class="trait">P.</span> formosus </italic> LHL10 showed the existence of GA and IAA biosynthesis related genetic expression. GAs are synthesized from converting mevalonic acid into <italic> geranylgeranyl diphosphate </italic> via <italic> hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A </italic> , <italic> farnesyl diphosphate </italic> and <italic> geranylgeranyl diphosphate </italic> (GGDP). We observed the expression of <italic> GGS2 </italic> was detected in RT-PCR, which encodes GGDP synthase principally accountable for providing <italic> GGDP </italic> for GA production. Similarly, <italic> ent-kaurene oxidase (P450-4) </italic> expression indicates that <italic> <span class="trait">P.</span> formosus </italic> has cluster of <span class="gene">P450</span> monooxygenase-encoding genes which play crucial role in GAs biosynthesis. <italic> GA20-oxidase </italic> expression was also analyzed in <italic> <span class="trait">P.</span> formosus </italic> in the current study and the result showed expression in RT-PCR. <italic> GA20-oxidase </italic> has been reported for in the synthesis of active GAs in <italic> F. fujikuroi </italic> ( <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr"> Tudzynski et al., 2001 </xref> ; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> B&#x000f6;mke and Tudzynski, 2009 </xref> ). <italic> C13-oxidase (P450-3) </italic> was also analyzed in <italic> <span class="trait">P.</span> formosus </italic> and was comparatively less expressed. <italic> C13-oxidase (P450-3) </italic> has the role to catalyze C <sub> 13 </sub> -hydroxylation of GA <sub> 4 </sub> to produce the minor GA1 ( <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> B&#x000f6;mke and Tudzynski, 2009 </xref> ). The presence of aforementioned genes involved in the GAs biosynthesis pathway validated the GA producing capability of endophytic <italic> <span class="trait">P.</span> formosus </italic> LHL10. Previously, same GA gene cluster has also been reported in <italic> Fusarium fujikuroi </italic> , <italic> Gibberella fujikuroi </italic> , and <italic> Fusarium proliferatum </italic> ( <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr"> Tudzynski et al., 2001 </xref> ; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> Albermann et al., 2013 </xref> ; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr"> Rim et al., 2013 </xref> ). However, there is no information on GA gene biosynthetic pathway in <italic> Paecilomyces </italic> sp. Current report has elucidated it for the first time.
