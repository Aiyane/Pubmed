						<span class="trait">Phosphorus</span> (P) is essential for all living cells and organisms, and low-P stress is a major factor constraining plant growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> worldwide. In plants, P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> is a complex quantitative trait involving multiple genes, and the mechanisms underlying P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> are largely unknown. Combining linkage analysis, genome-wide and candidate-gene association analyses, and plant transformation, we identified a soybean gene related to P <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> determined its favorable haplotypes and developed valuable functional markers. First, six major genomic regions associated with P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> were detected by performing genome-wide associations (GWAs) in various environments. A highly significant region located on chromosome 8, qPE8, was identified by both GWAs and linkage mapping and explained 41% of the phenotypic variation. Then, a regional mapping study was performed with 40 surrounding markers in 192 diverse soybean accessions. A strongly associated haplotype (P = 10(-7)) consisting of the markers Sat_233 and BARC-039899-07603 was identified, and qPE8 was located in a region of approximately 250 kb, which contained a candidate gene <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> that encoded an acid phosphatase. <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> overexpression in soybean hairy roots increased P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by 11-20% relative to the control. A candidate-gene association analysis indicated that six natural <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> polymorphisms explained 33% of the phenotypic variation. The favorable alleles and haplotypes of <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> associated with increased transcript expression correlated with higher enzyme activity. The discovery of the optimal haplotype of <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> will now enable the accurate selection of soybeans with higher P efficiencies and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in plants.

						A potential mechanism to enhance utilization of sparingly soluble forms of <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) is the root secretion of malate, which is mainly mediated by the ALMT gene family in plants. In this study, a total of 34 <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> genes were identified in the soybean genome. Expression patterns diverged considerably among <span class="gene">GmALMTs</span> in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in leaves, roots and flowers, with expression altered by P availability in 26 of the 34 <span class="gene">GmALMTs.</span> One root-specific <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean P nutrition. Analysis of <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots. Furthermore, both growth and P content of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external P source. Taken together, these results indicate that members of the soybean <span class="gene">GmALMT</span> gene family exhibit diverse responses to Pi starvation. One member of this family, <span class="gene">GmALMT5,</span> might contribute to soybean P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble P sources under P limited conditions.

						KEY MESSAGE: Both in vitro and in vivo hairy root transformation systems could not replace whole plant transformation for promoter analysis of root-specific and low-P induced genes in soybean. An efficient genetic transformation system is crucial for promoter analysis in plants. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is the most popular method to produce transgenic hairy roots or plants. In the present study, first, we compared the two different Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root transformation methods using either constitutive CaMV35S or the promoters of root-preferential genes, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> and <span class="gene">GmPAP21,</span> in soybean, and found the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of in vitro hairy root transformation was significantly higher than that of in vivo transformation. We compared Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated whole plant transformation systems. The results showed that low-phosphorous (P) inducible <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> and <span class="gene">GmPAP21</span> promoters could not induce the increased expression of the GUS reporter gene under low P stress in both in vivo and in vitro transgenic hairy roots. Conversely, GUS activity of <span class="gene">GmPAP21</span> promoter was significantly higher at low P than high P in whole plant transformation. Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo hairy root transformation systems could not replace whole plant transformation for promoter analysis of root-specific and low-P induced genes in soybean.

						Phosphate (Pi) remobilization within a plant is critical for plant survival under Pi-limiting conditions. In this paper, a soybean Pi transporter gene, <span class="gene">GmPT1,</span> was characterized. A marked induction of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> transcript was observed in young leaves, mature leaves and lateral roots during long-term Pi starvation. Transgenic tobacco plants containing the <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> gene were obtained using an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants showed significant increases in phosphorus-use <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (PUE), photosystem II (PSII) function, total dry weight and seed weight under Pi-deficient conditions. <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels and PUE were determined in a soybean recombinant inbred line population during a pot experiment that was conducted to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic rate (PN ) and seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> Correlation analysis revealed that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels had significantly positive correlations with seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> PUE, PN and the quantum <span class="trait">yield</span> of PSII primary photochemistry (ΦPSII ). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping for <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> revealed two eQTLs, one of which coincided with both the physical location of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> and a QTL associated with seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> plays a role in Pi remobilization, and it may be possible to improve soybean seed yields under Pi-limiting conditions by modulating <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, root growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated root growth and consequently resulted in improved P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant dry weight and P content, respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of root and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P), iron (Fe) and water deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::GmEXPB2-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and P uptake, especially at low P levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and P uptake at both low and high P levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by Fe and mild water deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including P, Fe and water deficiency. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and P responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop P uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.

						<span class="trait">Phosphorus</span> (P) is essential for all living cells and organisms, and low-P stress represents a major constraint on plant growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> worldwide. Soybean is an important economical resource of protein and oil for human and animals, and soybean is also a high-P demand species that is sensitive to low-P stress, which is considered a major constraint on soybean production. However, P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> is an important complex quantitative trait involving multiple genes, and the mechanisms underlying soybean P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> are largely unknown. Here, we reported the construction of a high-density genetic map using a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) strategy in soybean. This map, spanning 3020.59 cM in length, contained 6159 markers on 20 chromosomes, with an average distance of 0.49 cM between adjacent markers. Based on this map, 20 loci, including eight novel loci, associated with P efficiency-related traits were identified across multiple years and treatments. The confidence intervals of almost all QTLs were refined significantly, and the accuracy of this map was evidenced by coincident detections of the previously identified P efficiency-related genes <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> and <span class="gene">GmPT1.</span> Notably, a highly significant novel QTL located on chromosome 4, q4-2, was identified across traits, years and treatments. Several candidate genes, such as a pectin methylesterase-encoding gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.04G214000)</span> and a protein kinase gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.13G161900),</span> with significantly differential expression upon low-P stress were considered as promising candidates involved in regulating soybean P <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> Markers that tightly associated with P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> could be used for marker-assisted selection in a soybean P efficient breeding program. Further, dissection of these QTLs will facilitate gene cloning underlying P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in soybean, and increase our understanding of efficient use of P in enhancing crop <span class="trait">yield.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in the phosphate (P) uptake of many important crop species, but the mechanisms that control their <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and their contribution to the P nutrition of the host plant are only poorly understood. METHODS: The P uptake and growth potential of two soybean genotypes that differ in their root architectural traits and P acquisition <span class="trait">efficiency</span> were studied after colonization with different AM fungi and the transcript levels of plant P transporters involved in the plant or mycorrhizal P uptake pathway were examined. KEY RESULTS: The mycorrhizal growth responses of both soybean genotypes ranged from highly beneficial to detrimental, and were dependent on the P supply conditions, and the fungal species involved. Only the colonization with Rhizophagus irregularis increased the growth and P uptake of both soybean genotypes. The expression of <span class="gene">GmPT4</span> was downregulated, while the mycorrhiza-inducible P transporter <span class="gene">GmPT10</span> was upregulated by colonization with R. irregularis Colonization with both fungi also led to higher transcript levels of the mycorrhiza-inducible P transporter <span class="gene">GmPT9,</span> but only in plants colonized with R. irregularis were the higher transcript levels correlated to a better P supply. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that AM fungi can also significantly contribute to the P uptake and growth potential of genotypes with a higher P acquisition <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> but that mycorrhizal P benefits depend strongly on the P supply conditions and the fungal species involved.

						Soybean is a high <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) demand species that is sensitive to low-P stress. Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) for P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> have been identified in soybean, but few of these have been cloned and agriculturally applied mainly due to various limitations on identifying suitable P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> candidate genes. Here, we combined QTL mapping, transcriptome profiling, and plant transformation to identify candidate genes underlying QTLs associated with low-P tolerance and response mechanisms to low-P stress in soybean. By performing QTL linkage mapping using 152 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that were derived from a cross between a P-efficient variety, Nannong 94-156, and P-sensitive Bogao, we identified four major QTLs underlying P <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> Within these four QTL regions, 34/81 candidate genes in roots/leaves were identified using comparative transcriptome analysis between two transgressive RILs, low-P tolerant genotype B20 and sensitive B18. A total of 22 phosphatase family genes were up-regulated significantly under low-P condition in B20. Overexpression of an acid phosphatase candidate gene, <span class="gene">GmACP2,</span> in soybean hairy roots increased P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by 15.43-24.54 % compared with that in controls. Our results suggest that integrating QTL mapping and transcriptome profiling could be useful for rapidly identifying candidate genes underlying complex traits, and phosphatase-encoding genes, such as <span class="gene">GmACP2,</span> play important roles involving in low-P stress tolerance in soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant productivity relies on photosynthesis, and the photosynthetic process relies on <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P). The genetic basis of photosynthesis and P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (PE) affecting <span class="trait">yield</span> has been separately characterized in various crop plants. However, the genetic relationship between PE and photosynthesis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used a combined analysis of phenotypic correlation, linkage mapping, and expression analysis to dissect the relationship between PE and photosynthesis. We found significant phenotypic correlations between PE and photosynthetic related traits, particularly under low P stress. A total of 172 QTLs for both traits were detected and classified into 29 genomic regions. 12 (41.4%) of 29 regions were detected to be associated with both PE and photosynthetic related traits. Three major QTLs, q14-2, q15-2, and q19-2, were found to be associated with both traits and explained 6.6-58.9% of phenotypic variation. A photosynthetic-specific QTL cluster, q12-1, was detected under both normal and low P conditions, suggesting that genes responsible for this region were less effected by low P stress, and could be used in high photosynthetic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> breeding programs. In addition, several candidate genes with significantly differential expression upon low P stress, such as a purple acid phosphatase gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.19G193900)</span> within q19-2 region, were considered as promising candidates involved in regulating both soybean PE and photosynthetic capacity. Our results reveal a significant genetic relationship between PE and photosynthetic traits, and uncover several major genomic regions specific or common to these traits. The markers linked closely to these major QTLs may be used for selection of soybean varieties with improved P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and photosynthetic capacity.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A 2-year field experiment was conducted in 2011 and 2012 to investigate the effects of <span class="trait">phosphorus</span> (P) fertilization on the leaf area index (LAI), dry matter accumulation (DMA), and P use <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (PUE) of maize in wheat/maize/soybean intercropping system. Five P fertilization rates were installed, i.e., 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg P2O5 x hm(-2) for wheat, marked as WP0, WP1, WP2, WP3, and WP4, respectively, and 0, 37.5, 75, 112.5, and 150 kg P2O5 x hm(-2) for maize, marked as MP0, MP1, MP2, MP3, and MP4, respectively. During the coexisted growth periods of wheat and maize, P fertilization increased the LAI, leaf area duration (LAD), and stem and leaf DMA of maize significantly. After the jointing stage of maize, the maize LAI, LAD, DMA, and crop growth rate (CGR) all decreased after an initial increase with the increasing P rate, with the maximum growth in treatment <span class="gene">MP2</span> or MP3. During the reproductive stage of maize, the maize dry mass translocation from vegetative to reproductive organ increased with increasing P fertilization rate, and the grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of both maize and whole cropping system increased firstly and decreased then, with the maximum grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of maize and whole cropping system being 6588 and 11955 kg x hm(-2) in treatment P3, respectively. The P apparent recovery <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of maize was the highest (26.3%) in treatment MP2, being 82.6%, 38.4%, and 152.9% higher than that in MP1 (14.4%), MP3 (19.0%), and MP4 (10.4%), respectively. In sum, for the wheat/maize/soybean intercropping system, applying appropriate amount of P fertilizer could promote maize growth, alleviate the impact of wheat on maize, and consequently, increase the P apparent recovery <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of maize. In this study, the appropriate P fertilization rate was 75-112.5 kg P2O5 x hm(-2).

						<span class="trait">Phosphorus</span> (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize P with high <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> To investigate the effects of iron (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of Fe in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different P <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing Fe concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The Fe reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total Fe uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more iron was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="trait">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by Fe deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased Fe concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active Fe in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable Fe concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.
