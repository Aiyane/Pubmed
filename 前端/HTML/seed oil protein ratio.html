				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Brassinosteroids (BRs) play key roles in plant growth and development, and regulate various agricultural traits. Enhanced BR signaling leads to increased <span class="trait">seed</span> number and <span class="trait">yield</span> in Arabidopsis bzr1-1D (AtBZR1(P234L), gain-of-function mutant of the important transcription factor in BR signaling/effects). BR signal transduction pathway is well elucidated in Arabidopsis but less known in other species. Soybean is an important dicot crop producing edible <span class="trait">oil</span> and <span class="trait">protein.</span> Phylogenetic analysis reveals AtBZR1-like genes are highly conserved in angiosperm and there are 4 orthologues in soybean <span class="gene">(GmBZL1-4).</span> We here report the functional characterization of <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> (relatively highly expresses in flowers). The P234 site in AtBZR1 is conserved in <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> (P216) and mutation of <span class="gene">GmBZL2(P216L)</span> leads to <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> accumulation. <span class="gene">GmBZL2(P216L)</span> <span class="gene">(GmBZL2*)</span> in Arabidopsis results in enhanced BR signaling; including increased <span class="trait">seed</span> number per silique. <span class="gene">GmBZL2*</span> partially rescued the defects of bri1-5, further demonstrating the conserved function of <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> with AtBZR1. BR treatment promotes the accumulation, nuclear localization and dephosphorylation/phosphorylation <span class="trait">ratio</span> of <span class="gene">GmBZL2,</span> revealing that <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> activity is regulated conservatively by BR signaling. Our studies not only indicate the conserved regulatory mechanism of <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> and BR signaling pathway in soybean, but also suggest the potential application of <span class="gene">GmBZL2</span> in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soya bean (Glycine max) plants overexpressing a seed-specific bacterial phytoene synthase gene from Pantoea ananatis modified to target to plastids accumulated 845 μg β carotene g(-1) dry <span class="trait">seed</span> weight with a desirable 12:1 <span class="trait">ratio</span> of β to α. The β carotene accumulating seeds exhibited a shift in <span class="trait">oil</span> composition increasing oleic acid with a concomitant decrease in linoleic acid and an increase in <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> content by at least 4% (w/w). Elevated β-carotene accumulating soya bean cotyledons contain 40% the amount of abscisic acid compared to nontransgenic cotyledons. Proteomic and nontargeted metabolomic analysis of the mid-maturation β-carotene cotyledons compared to the nontransgenic did not reveal any significant differences that would account for the altered phenotypes of both elevated oleate and <span class="trait">protein</span> content. Transcriptomic analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR, revealed a number of significant differences in ABA-responsive transcripton factor gene expression in the <span class="gene">crtB</span> transgenics compared to nontransgenic cotyledons of the same maturation stage. The altered <span class="trait">seed</span> composition traits seem to be attributed to altered ABA hormone levels varying transcription factor expression. The elevated β-carotene, oleic acid and <span class="trait">protein</span> traits in the β-carotene soya beans confer a substantial additive nutritional quality to soya beans.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits of beta-conglycinin was suppressed by sequence-mediated gene silencing in transgenic soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> The resulting seeds had similar total <span class="trait">oil</span> and <span class="trait">protein</span> content and <span class="trait">ratio</span> compared with the parent line. The decrease in beta-conglycinin <span class="trait">protein</span> was apparently compensated by an increased accumulation of glycinin. In addition, proglycinin, the precursor of glycinin, was detected as a prominent polypeptide band in the <span class="trait">protein</span> profile of the transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> extract. Electron microscopic analysis and immunocytochemistry of maturing transgenic soybean seeds indicated that the process of storage <span class="trait">protein</span> accumulation was altered in the transgenic line. In normal soybeans, the storage proteins are deposited in pre-existing vacuoles by Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, in transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> with reduced beta-conglycinin levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles were observed that resembled precursor accumulating-vesicles of pumpkin seeds and the <span class="trait">protein</span> bodies accumulated by cereal seeds. Their ER-derived membrane of the novel vesicles did not contain the <span class="trait">protein</span> storage vacuole tonoplast-specific <span class="trait">protein</span> alpha-TIP, and the sequestered polypeptides did not contain complex glycans, indicating a preGolgi and nonvacuolar nature. Glycinin was identified as a major component of these novel <span class="trait">protein</span> bodies and its diversion from normal storage <span class="trait">protein</span> trafficking appears to be related to the proglycinin buildup in the transgenic <span class="trait">seed.</span> The stable accumulation of proteins in a <span class="trait">protein</span> body compartment instead of vacuolar accumulation of proteins may provide an alternative intracellular site to sequester proteins when soybeans are used as <span class="trait">protein</span> factories.
