				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Aiming to manipulate CK levels to improve <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance of soybean cultivars through genetic engineering of CK metabolic genes, we surveyed the soybean genome and identified 14 CK biosynthetic (isopentenyltransferase, <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> ) and 17 CK degradative (CK dehydrogenase, <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> ) genes
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our systematic analysis of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To clarify the regulation of CK metabolism in soybean during normal growth and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, we have analyzed the expression patterns of <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions in a tissue-specific fashion
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						2 abiotic stress-inducible <italic> cis </italic> -elements <span class="trait">per</span> promoter of genes encoding <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKX,</span> respectively
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Among the <italic> <span class="gene">IPT</span> </italic> transcripts expressed in remarkably high abundance, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> transcript was consistently increased in the leaves and young seedling shoots under <span class="trait">drought</span> or dehydration conditions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g005"> Figures 5A </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> 6A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> 7A </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In R2 leaves, <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> was the only gene whose expression was significantly induced (&#x0223c;7-fold) by <span class="trait">drought</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7A </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Other <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes, which were significantly induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the V6-stage leaves, are <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT09</span> </italic> and <italic> 13 </italic> , and the degree of induction of these genes was higher in the younger trifoliate leaves ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> Figure 6A </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As for the drought-repressible <italic> <span class="gene">IPT</span> </italic> genes identified in the leaf tissues, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT05</span> </italic> transcripts were repressed by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the leaves of various stages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g005"> Figures 5A </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> 6A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> 7A </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the R2-stage leaves, expression of almost all highly expressed <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes, except that of <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> , was repressed by <span class="trait">drought</span>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As for the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes, five <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> s ( <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX01</span> </italic> , <italic> 02 </italic> , <italic> 06 </italic> , <italic> 13 </italic> and <italic> 15 </italic> ) were found to be severely reduced at transcriptional level by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the V6 leaves ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> Figure 6B </xref> ), and four of which, except <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX06</span> </italic> , were also significantly downregulated in R2 leaves under <span class="trait">drought</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7B </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In addition, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX14</span> </italic> transcript was found to be significantly induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in various tissues at different stages
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, most of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> s were induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the R2 roots ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7B </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Disruption of <italic> <span class="gene">CKX3</span> </italic> and <italic> CKX5 </italic> genes in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> resulted in higher CK levels, which subsequently led to larger inflorescences and floral meristems, increased size of the WUSCHEL expression domain, supernumerary ovules and increased seed <span class="trait">yield</span> of the <italic> ckx3,5 </italic> double mutant plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT02</span> </italic> was the major transcript in flowers, <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> and <italic> 02 </italic> expressed in the greatest abundance in full pods while <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> , <italic> 02 </italic> and <italic> 11 </italic> were the most abundant transcripts in R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The variation in the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> transcript levels in flowers, pods and R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span> suggested that each of these organs required different <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes for CK biosynthesis
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT02</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT11</span> </italic> might play the most important role in flowers and R5 <span class="trait">seeds,</span> respectively, while <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> and <italic> 02 </italic> appear to be equally important in full pods as judged by their abundant expression
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression levels of <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes were also determined in flowers, pods and R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g008"> Figure 8B </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In R5 <span class="trait">seeds,</span> <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX08</span> </italic> was still the most highly abundant transcript, while the second most abundant one was <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX16</span> </italic>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our data suggest that a decrease in DZ content, which is associated with the downregulation of the majority of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes and the upregulation of <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX03</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX14</span> </italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7 </xref> ), contributes significantly to the overall reduction of CK content in <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed soybean leaves
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Additionally, DZ may be involved in regulation of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress responses through <span class="gene">GmHK12,</span> which has high homology to AHK3

						Our systematic analysis of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> families has provided an insight into CK metabolism in soybean under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and a solid foundation for in-depth characterization and future development of improved drought-tolerant soybean cultivars by manipulation of CK levels via biotechnological approach.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To clarify the regulation of CK metabolism in soybean during normal growth and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, we have analyzed the expression patterns of <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes under normal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions in a tissue-specific fashion.

						2 abiotic stress-inducible <italic> cis </italic> -elements <span class="trait">per</span> promoter of genes encoding <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> and <span class="gene">GmCKX,</span> respectively.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Among the <italic> <span class="gene">IPT</span> </italic> transcripts expressed in remarkably high abundance, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> transcript was consistently increased in the leaves and young seedling shoots under <span class="trait">drought</span> or dehydration conditions ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g005"> Figures 5A </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> 6A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> 7A </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In R2 leaves, <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> was the only gene whose expression was significantly induced (&#x0223c;7-fold) by <span class="trait">drought</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7A </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Other <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes, which were significantly induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the V6-stage leaves, are <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT09</span> </italic> and <italic> 13 </italic> , and the degree of induction of these genes was higher in the younger trifoliate leaves ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> Figure 6A </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As for the drought-repressible <italic> <span class="gene">IPT</span> </italic> genes identified in the leaf tissues, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT05</span> </italic> transcripts were repressed by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the leaves of various stages ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g005"> Figures 5A </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> 6A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> 7A </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the R2-stage leaves, expression of almost all highly expressed <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes, except that of <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT08</span> </italic> , was repressed by <span class="trait">drought</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As for the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes, five <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> s ( <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX01</span> </italic> , <italic> 02 </italic> , <italic> 06 </italic> , <italic> 13 </italic> and <italic> 15 </italic> ) were found to be severely reduced at transcriptional level by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the V6 leaves ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g006"> Figure 6B </xref> ), and four of which, except <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX06</span> </italic> , were also significantly downregulated in R2 leaves under <span class="trait">drought</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7B </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In addition, the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX14</span> </italic> transcript was found to be significantly induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in various tissues at different stages.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, most of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> s were induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> in the R2 roots ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7B </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Disruption of <italic> <span class="gene">CKX3</span> </italic> and <italic> CKX5 </italic> genes in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> resulted in higher CK levels, which subsequently led to larger inflorescences and floral meristems, increased size of the WUSCHEL expression domain, supernumerary ovules and increased seed <span class="trait">yield</span> of the <italic> ckx3,5 </italic> double mutant plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT02</span> </italic> was the major transcript in flowers, <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> and <italic> 02 </italic> expressed in the greatest abundance in full pods while <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> , <italic> 02 </italic> and <italic> 11 </italic> were the most abundant transcripts in R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The variation in the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> transcript levels in flowers, pods and R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span> suggested that each of these organs required different <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes for CK biosynthesis.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT02</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT11</span> </italic> might play the most important role in flowers and R5 <span class="trait">seeds,</span> respectively, while <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT01</span> </italic> and <italic> 02 </italic> appear to be equally important in full pods as judged by their abundant expression.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression levels of <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX</span> </italic> genes were also determined in flowers, pods and R5 <span class="trait">seeds</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g008"> Figure 8B </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In R5 <span class="trait">seeds,</span> <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX08</span> </italic> was still the most highly abundant transcript, while the second most abundant one was <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX16</span> </italic>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our data suggest that a decrease in DZ content, which is associated with the downregulation of the majority of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmIPT</span> </italic> genes and the upregulation of <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX03</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmCKX14</span> </italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0042411-g007"> Figure 7 </xref> ), contributes significantly to the overall reduction of CK content in <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed soybean leaves.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Additionally, DZ may be involved in regulation of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress responses through <span class="gene">GmHK12,</span> which has high homology to AHK3.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Both <italic> <span class="gene">GmHK12</span> </italic> and <italic> AHK3 </italic> were upregulated by <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, and AHK3 was shown to act as a negative regulator of <span class="trait">drought</span> stress signaling in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.
