						To determine whether <italic> OsPYLs </italic> are functional ABA receptors in rice, <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> were selected for further investigation. Constructs of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> driven by the <italic> 35S </italic> promoter were transformed into rice, and more than 20 independent transgenic lines were produced for each gene. Three independent transgenic lines of each gene were chosen for further analysis. The expression levels of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> in the transgenic lines were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and RT-PCR, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5a </xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> b </xref> ). <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> were overexpressed in the transgenic lines compared to the control lines (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5a </xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> b </xref> ). A <span class="trait">seed</span> germination assay was conducted to examine the ABA-related phenotype of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> overexpression lines. In the absence of ABA, <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> overexpression lines showed a slight delay in germination rate, and the <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> overexpression line germinated at a slower rate compared to that of the <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> overexpression line (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5c </xref> , <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> d </xref> , and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> g </xref> ). Application of different concentrations of ABA showed that the <span class="trait">seed</span> germination rate of the <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> overexpression lines was markedly slower than that of the controls (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5c </xref> , <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> e </xref> , <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> f </xref> , <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> h </xref> , and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> i </xref> ). <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> overexpression lines hardly germinated in a medium containing 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of ABA until 5&#x000a0;days later (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5i </xref> ). This finding indicated that the overexpression of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> conferred ABA-hypersensitivity during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination and functioned as an active ABA receptor. In addition, a higher expression level of <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> than that observed with <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> in embryos may explain its enhanced phenotype during ABA-regulated <span class="trait">seed</span> germination (Figs.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1a </xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ). <fig id="Fig5"> <label> Fig. 5 </label> <caption> <p> Overexpression of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> confer ABA hypersensitivity during <span class="trait">seed</span> germination. <bold> a </bold> Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> in overexpression transgenic lines.

(D to I) Germination time course of <italic> OsPYL3 </italic> ( <bold> d </bold> - <bold> f </bold> ) and <italic> OsPYL9 </italic> ( <bold> g </bold> - <bold> i </bold> ) overexpression transgenic lines and control in medium without ABA ( <bold> d </bold> and <bold> g </bold> ), 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M ABA (E and H) and 3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M ABA ( <bold> f </bold> and <bold> i </bold> ). Data show the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD of three replicates. At least 50 seeds per genotype were measured in each replicate

						Dehulled seeds were surface-sterilized and planted on half-strength <span class="gene">MS</span> medium supplemented with indicated concentration of ABA (A1049, Sigma-Aldrich). <span class="trait">Seed</span> germination was defined as the coleoptiles emerged from the <span class="trait">seed</span> and scored every 12 h for 5 days. Three independent T3 homologous transgenic lines and the control Longjing 11 were used for <span class="trait">stress</span> tolerance experiments. For the dehydration treatment, rice plants grown for 3 weeks were withhold water for 10 days and then rehydrated and grown under normal conditions for 7 days. For <span class="trait">cold</span> treatment, 14-day-old seedlings were transferred to 10 &#x000b0;C for 4 days and then returned to normal growth conditions for 7 days. The survival rates were recorded. Approximately 50 seedlings of each line were used for each experiment, and three replicates of each experiment were performed. Tests for statistical analysis between transgenic lines and the controls were performed using Microsoft excel 2007.
