						The soybean pod borer <span class="trait">(Leguminivora</span> <span class="trait">glycinivorella</span> Matsumura) successfully survives the winter because of its high expression of 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s) during its overwintering diapause. The amount of HSP70s is different under different environmental stresses. In this study, inducible heat shock protein 70 and its constitutive heat shock cognate 70 were cloned by RT-PCR and RACE. These genes were named Lg-hsp70 and Lg-hsc70, respectively. Gene transcription and protein expression after cold stress treatment (5°C to -5°C) were analyzed by western blotting and by qRT-PCR for four populations that were sampled in the northeast region of China, including Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Harbin and Heihe, when the soybean pod borer was in diapause. As the cold shock temperature decreased, the levels of Lg-HSP70s were significantly up-regulated. The amount of cold-induced Lg-HSP70s was highest in the southernmost population (Shenyang, 41°50'N) and lowest in the northernmost population (Heihe, 50°22'N). These results support the hypothesis that the soybean pod borer in the northeast region of China displays phenotypic plasticity, and the accumulation of Lg-HSP70s is a strategy for overcoming environmental stress. These results also suggest that the induction of <span class="gene">HSP70</span> synthesis, which is a complex physiological adaptation, can evolve quickly and inherit stability.

						The soybean pod borer ( <italic> <span class="trait">Leguminivora</span> <span class="trait">glycinivorella</span> </italic> Matsumura) successfully survives the winter because of its high expression of 70-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70s) during its overwintering diapause. The amount of HSP70s is different under different environmental stresses. In this study, inducible heat shock protein 70 and its constitutive heat shock cognate 70 were cloned by RT-PCR and RACE. These genes were named <italic> Lg-hsp70 </italic> and <italic> Lg-hsc70 </italic> , respectively. Gene transcription and protein expression after cold stress treatment (5&#x000b0;C to &#x02212;5&#x000b0;C) were analyzed by western blotting and by qRT-PCR for four populations that were sampled in the northeast region of China, including Shenyang, Gongzhuling, Harbin and Heihe, when the soybean pod borer was in diapause. As the cold shock temperature decreased, the levels of Lg-HSP70s were significantly up-regulated. The amount of cold-induced Lg-HSP70s was highest in the southernmost population (Shenyang, 41&#x000b0;50&#x02032;N) and lowest in the northernmost population (Heihe, 50&#x000b0;22&#x02032;N). These results support the hypothesis that the soybean pod borer in the northeast region of China displays phenotypic plasticity, and the accumulation of Lg-HSP70s is a strategy for overcoming environmental stress. These results also suggest that the induction of <span class="gene">HSP70</span> synthesis, which is a complex physiological adaptation, can evolve quickly and inherit stability.

						As molecular chaperones, HSP70s can recover the normal structure of denatured proteins to repair and protect the cell as well as increase the tolerance and <span class="trait">resistance</span> of insects <xref rid="pone.0109465-Rinehart1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Mads1" ref-type="bibr"> [5] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Doucet1" ref-type="bibr"> [6] </xref> . HSP70s have a conserved structure and prevail in living organisms <xref rid="pone.0109465-Schlesinger1" ref-type="bibr"> [7] </xref> . Depending on the expression style, these proteins are classified as inducible <span class="gene">HSP70</span> (70-kDa Heat shock protein,HSP70) or constitutive HSC70 (Heat shock cognate protein, HSC70) <xref rid="pone.0109465-Qin1" ref-type="bibr"> [8] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Franzellitti1" ref-type="bibr"> [9] </xref> . In general, the levels of <span class="gene">HSP70</span> are low in normal conditions and increase upon environmental stress, such as high or low temperatures and exposure to heavy metals or microbial infection. HSC70 is stably expressed and only slightly increases upon environmental stress <xref rid="pone.0109465-Daugaard1" ref-type="bibr"> [10] </xref> .
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression level of HSP70s can be up-regulated by low temperature during insect diapause. This up-regulation has been observed in <italic> Chilo suppressalis </italic> and <italic> Sesamia nonagrioides </italic> , which belong to Lepidoptera <xref rid="pone.0109465-Sonoda1" ref-type="bibr"> [11] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Gkouvitsas1" ref-type="bibr"> [12] </xref> , in <italic> Drosophila triauraria </italic> and <italic> Drosophila melanogaster </italic> , which belong to Diptera <xref rid="pone.0109465-Goto1" ref-type="bibr"> [13] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Sinclair1" ref-type="bibr"> [14] </xref> , and in <italic> Leptinotarsa decemlineata </italic> , which belongs to Coleoptera <xref rid="pone.0109465-Yocum1" ref-type="bibr"> [15] </xref> . RNAi was used to study the effect of <span class="gene">HSP70</span> expression on cold-stress <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Similar to conditions when <span class="gene">HSP70</span> expression was inhibited, <italic> Pyrrhocoris apterus </italic> has a less intense response to cold <span class="trait">resistance</span> in diapause, and the pupae of <italic> Sarcophaga crassipalpis </italic> have feeble cold <span class="trait">resistance</span> <xref rid="pone.0109465-Rinehart1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Kostl1" ref-type="bibr"> [16] </xref> . Therefore, we hypothesize that high <span class="gene">HSP70</span> expression plays an important role in increasing insect <span class="trait">resistance</span> to cold stress.

						HSP70s are an example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity providing inducible tolerance to the environment <xref rid="pone.0109465-Callahan1" ref-type="bibr"> [17] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Schulte1" ref-type="bibr"> [18] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Luo1" ref-type="bibr"> [19] </xref> . Phenotypic plasticity allows insects to react to different environments <xref rid="pone.0109465-Bradshaw1" ref-type="bibr"> [20] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-VanKleunen1" ref-type="bibr"> [21] </xref> . This characteristic prevails in different organisms and represents an important aspect of adaptive evolution <xref rid="pone.0109465-Sultan1" ref-type="bibr"> [22] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Pigliucci1" ref-type="bibr"> [23] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Bourgeois1" ref-type="bibr"> [24] </xref> . Phenotypic plasticity does not only increase cold stress <span class="trait">resistance</span> but also allows it to be stably inherited, playing an important role in insect evolution <xref rid="pone.0109465-Whitman1" ref-type="bibr"> [25] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Stillwell1" ref-type="bibr"> [26] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Schlichting1" ref-type="bibr"> [27] </xref> . Because <italic> <span class="gene">hsp70</span> </italic> is a plasticity gene, understanding the function of <italic> hsp70s </italic> could supply a good theoretical foundation for understanding insect adaptability to the environment <xref rid="pone.0109465-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr"> [28] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Moczek1" ref-type="bibr"> [29] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Morris1" ref-type="bibr"> [30] </xref> . To date, the homologous genes of <italic> hsp70s </italic> in relation to phenotypic plasticity have been studied in <italic> Rhagoletis cerasi </italic> , <italic> Calliphora vicina </italic> , <italic> Lymantria dispar </italic> and <italic> Melitaea cinxia </italic> <xref rid="pone.0109465-Luo1" ref-type="bibr"> [19] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Moraiti1" ref-type="bibr"> [31] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr"> [32] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Mrdakovi1" ref-type="bibr"> [33] </xref> . However, the variation between conspecifics of different geographical populations has not been widely assessed <xref rid="pone.0109465-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [34] </xref> .
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Because <span class="gene">HSP70</span> production requires more energy, this production may incur significant costs to the synthesis of other proteins <xref rid="pone.0109465-Krebs1" ref-type="bibr"> [51] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Feder1" ref-type="bibr"> [52] </xref> . Therefore, the northern population might have evolved other more reasonable, less costly mechanisms to cope with cold stress <xref rid="pone.0109465-Lansing1" ref-type="bibr"> [48] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Srensen2" ref-type="bibr"> [53] </xref> . In recent years, possible mechanisms have been studied and include accumulating low-molecular-weight cryoprotectants <xref rid="pone.0109465-Crowe1" ref-type="bibr"> [54] </xref> , synthesizing antifreeze proteins <xref rid="pone.0109465-Duman1" ref-type="bibr"> [55] </xref> and remodeling the structure of the cell membrane <xref rid="pone.0109465-Tomcala1" ref-type="bibr"> [56] </xref> . In contrast, with the development of molecular biology, the function, reactions and location of HSP70s also could be identified by bioinformatics tools and proteomics techniques, such as 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectra which have become powerful tools to discover and validate protein-coding genes. Some proteomic studies showed that different isoforms of the <span class="gene">HSP70</span> family, including HSP68, HSP70Ba, and HSP70Bb, exist and that several of them displayed strong increases in protein abundance during environmental variations <xref rid="pone.0109465-Aparna1" ref-type="bibr"> [57] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0109465-Herv1" ref-type="bibr"> [58] </xref> . Furthermore, the gene annotation and localization might play a pivotal role to facilitate identification and analysis of HSP70s in the integrated genome of <italic> L. <span class="trait">glycinivorella</span> </italic> . Thus, on the basis of this research, application of proteomic and genomic strategies could supply good support for the relevant mechanism of <italic> L. <span class="trait">glycinivorella</span> </italic> from different populations.
