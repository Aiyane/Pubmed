						Vegetable oils form an important part of the human diet, providing concentrated sources of energy and essential nutrients. A process is used for the deacidification of a vegetable oil in which the major acid of the vegetable oil is from the group comprised of epoxy fatty acids, hydroxy fatty acids, linoleic acid, and oleic acid [ <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> 1 </xref> ]. The consumption of oils with high oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> is beneficial because this monounsaturated fatty acid not only improves the shelf life but also reduces the need for hydrogenation, a process adding to the cost of the oil as well as generating unwanted trans fat that has been linked to many health problems in humans [ <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"> 2 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> 4 </xref> ]. The commodity soybean oil is composed of five fatty acids: oleic acid (18:1), <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), linoleic acid (18:2), and linolenic acid (18:3). The percentages of these five fatty acids in soybean oil average are 18%, 10%, 4%, 55%, and 13%, respectively [ <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"> 5 </xref> ]. Most polyunsaturated fatty acids, up to 90% in nonphotosynthetic tissues of plants, are synthesized through a (18:1) desaturase in the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated oleate desaturase <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> (1-acyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine &#x00394; 12-desaturase) is the key enzyme responsible for the production of linoleic acid in plants [ <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> 6 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> 8 </xref> ].
					</p>

						In soybeans, two copies of microsomal <italic> &#x003c9; </italic> -6 desaturase, <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1 and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2, have been cloned [ <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"> 9 </xref> ]. Studies have shown that <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1 was expressed primarily in the development of seeds, while <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2 was expressed in both the vegetative tissues and the development of seeds [ <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"> 10 </xref> , <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ]. Also, the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2 desaturases consisted of <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2A <span class="gene">(Glyma19g32930),</span> <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2B <span class="gene">(Glyma19g32940),</span> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2C <span class="gene">(Glyma03g30070).</span> <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1A and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1B are most closely related to one another, with a shared genomic organization containing a single intron and a 99% identity in encoded amino acid sequence. Thereby, this confirmed the importance expression during peak oil synthesis, while a possible role was also revealed for <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -2C under cool temperature conditions [ <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"> 12 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"> 14 </xref> ]. Genetic modification (GM) aimed at regulating the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> expression has been applied to produce oils with a higher C18:1 in soybeans [ <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> 15 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> 19 </xref> ]. For example, by antisense suppression of <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> in soybeans, a transgenic line was obtained that produced oil with a higher C18:1 (57%) compared to the wild variety [ <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"> 20 </xref> ]. Similarly, downregulating <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1 and <italic> FatB </italic> using interference RNA has enabled the production of soybeans with a significantly higher oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> (up to 94.58%) and reduced levels of <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid (&#x0003c;3%) [ <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> 21 </xref> ]. Recently, Plenish high oleic soybeans have been in commercial production by DuPont since 2012. They were developed using a biotech process known as gene silencing [ <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> 22 </xref> ]. These results demonstrate that the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2</span> </italic> family members play a very important role in metabolically engineered oil <span class="trait">seed</span> plants [ <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr"> 23 </xref> ].

						For the assembly of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> antisense RNA vector, a part of a fragment about 801&#x02009;bp of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> (GenBank accession: XM_003555831) was amplified from the cDNA above by using the primers <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b-F/GmFad2-1b-R</span> ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1 </xref> ). The amplified <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene product was cloned into the pEASY-T1 cloning vector (TransGene). The product was sequenced using T7 and M13 vector sequencing primers to confirm the sequence of the ligated product. An 801&#x02009;bp <italic> Xba </italic> I/ <italic> Sac </italic> I T1-vector digested <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> fragment was anticloned into a pCAMBIA3300 vector and digested with the same enzymes to put the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene under the <span class="trait">seed</span> <italic> &#x003b1; </italic> &#x02032; subunit of the <italic> &#x003b2; </italic> -conglycinin promoter ( <italic> BCSP </italic> ) with the different direction, and the <italic> BCSP </italic> &#x02032; function was discussed by Imoto et al. [ <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> 25 </xref> ]. The pCAMBIA3300 binary vector has a kanamycin <span class="trait">resistance</span> gene for bacterial selection and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase ( <italic> bar </italic> ) <span class="trait">resistance</span> gene for plant selection. The <italic> bar </italic> gene was driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. The <italic> Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic> strain EHA101 was used in this study.

						The high-frequency plant gene transfer system is one of the key stages for introducing useful or novel gene(s) into soybeans. In this study, we used the cotyledonary explant derived from mature soybean seeds for <italic> Agrobacterium </italic> -mediated transformation. The entire procedure for the <italic> Agrobacterium </italic> -mediated cotyledonary-node transformation system used in this study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2"> Table 2 </xref> . Additionally, high-level expression of recombinant molecules has been consistently achieved by utilizing specific regulatory sequences within the <span class="trait">seed</span> tissues. The cobombardment transformation strategy to generate transgenic soybean plants allowed us to evaluate the pCAMBIA3300- <italic> BCSP </italic> -anti- <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> plasmid vector ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2 </xref> ). The gene encoding of the anti- <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> was placed under the control of <italic> &#x003b1; </italic> &#x02032; subunit of the <italic> &#x003b2; </italic> -conglycinin ( <italic> BCSP </italic> ) soybean promoter and was introduced into the soybean genome with the aim of high-level suppressions, which resulted in a high oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in the soybean seeds. The promoter <italic> BCSP </italic> is tissue-specific and temporally regulated and is not expressed in the roots, stems, or leaves of soybean. In this study, the gene <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> under promoter <italic> BCSP </italic> was not expressed in the <span class="trait">seed</span> of soybean as expected from the result of the qRT-PCR assay ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5 </xref> ). Regulatory information for the tissue-specific expression mediated by the <italic> BCSP </italic> promoter and the other elements involved in the modulation of the expression of genes associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> storage protein has been localized to the DNA sequences approximately 250&#x02009;bp upstream from the transcription start site [ <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"> 28 </xref> , <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"> 29 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						For the detection of the transgenic soybean plants, we used three methods (the leaf painting, the LibertyLink strip analysis, and the PCR) to confirm the positive transgene plants. We performed 200 Williams 82 on the seeds, which contains about 327 explants infected by the cotyledonary-node method. Finally, we obtained 105 T <sub> 0 </sub> transgenic regeneration plants and a total of 55 plants tested positive, giving a 5.5% transformation efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3 </xref> shows a part of detection results by leaf painting, LibertyLink strip, and PCR analysis. Although the T <sub> 0 </sub> transgenic plants were generated in the lab, while the T <sub> 1 </sub> , T <sub> 2 </sub> were generated in the field, the rapid and exact method for determining positive transgenic status was pivotal. The PCR detection of a selected marker gene is a traditional and effective way of doing this, although false positive results are sometimes observed. Therefore, we checked a part of the sequence between the <italic> BCSP </italic> and the anti- <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> at about 752&#x02009;bp in the vector for the identification of any transgenic plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(c) </xref> ). However, the primary PCR testing is cumbersome and costly. Instead of the PCR procedures, a leaf painting method was chosen. As leaf painting directly detected the effect of a selected marker gene, it showed fewer false positive results than the PCR procedures. Furthermore, the leaf painting method was low in cost and easy to carry out ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(a) </xref> ). Since the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene fragment did not code for a functional protein, no novel protein was produced from the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene cassette. However, the expressing cassette contains the <italic> bar </italic> marker gene, which is characterized by a <span class="trait">resistance</span> to the herbicide bialaphos. The LibertyLink strips could therefore be used to quickly determinate genetically modified plants containing the <italic> bar </italic> gene ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(b) </xref> ). By the methods stated above, we identified 55 positive T <sub> 0 </sub> transgenic plants from the total 105 T <sub> 0 </sub> transgenic lines. We also used these detection methods to examine the T <sub> 1 </sub> and T <sub> 2 </sub> progenies of every independently transformed T <sub> 0 </sub> line. 11 of the 55 positive T <sub> 0 </sub> lines were further regenerated to T <sub> 1 </sub> lines and then T <sub> 2 </sub> lines. All 11 plants which exhibited Basta <span class="trait">resistance</span> also showed amplification of the <italic> bar </italic> gene in the PCR analysis (results not shown), thereby confirming the presence and expression of the transgene in transgenic the soybean plants.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The overall lipid <span class="trait">content</span> of 11 T <sub> 2 </sub> transgenic lines of soybean grain remained unchanged compared to the conventional soybean grain. Using fatty acid analysis, we selected three high oleic acid modified materials in the T <sub> 2 </sub> transgene lines. They are EB8011, EB8057, and EB8061. The EB8011 soybean grain contains increased levels of oleic acid (up to 51.71%) and lower levels of linoleic acid (27.32%), linolenic acid (8.47%), and to a lesser extent <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid (8.72%). In addition, EB8057 oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> is 38.23%, and EB8061 oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> is 40.48%, which were significantly higher than the receptor controls (17.70%) ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3"> Table 3 </xref> ). The lines EB8011 and EB8057 were presented at two copies in soybean genomic DNA while the line EB8061 was presented at three. In previous studies, <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> genes were identified as encoding <italic> &#x003c9; </italic> -6 fatty acid desaturases which catalyze the conversion of 18:1 oleic acid to 18:2 linoleic acid in soybeans [ <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"> 6 </xref> , <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ]. This conversion is of particular interest in the soybeans due to the growing desire for low linoleic soybean oil [ <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"> 4 </xref> ]. Moreover, a high oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid not only improves shelf life but also reduces the need for hydrogenation, a process which adds to the cost of the oil and generates unwanted trans fat that has been linked to many health problems in humans [ <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> 1 </xref> ]. Our study demonstrated high-level suppression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> by anti-RNA while also resulting in a high oleic acid in the soybeans.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We were successful in the suppression expression <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> in transgenic soybean seeds. Based on the published results on soybeans, the soybean <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2</span> </italic> gene family has been previously characterized at the genome level for structure and expression [ <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"> 9 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ] and also in genetic modification [ <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> 15 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"> 19 </xref> ]. In our study, silencing of the endogenous <italic> Fad2 </italic> -1 gene in seeds of the soybean event EB8011 was achieved through the introduction of a <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene fragment driven by a seed-specific promoter. The transcription of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> </italic> gene fragment in the <span class="trait">seed</span> acts to silence transcription of the endogenous <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> -1 gene. The line EB8011 had a result of 51.17% oleic acid and 8.72% <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid, in contrast to 17.7% oleic acid and 4.47% <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid in the seeds. In future studies, we also expect that the altered ratio of oleic and linoleic acid will confer desirable properties on the resulting biodiesel, without a significant change in the <span class="trait">yield.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Improving the quality and performance of soybean oil as biodiesel depends on the chemical composition of its fatty acids and requires an increase in monounsaturated acids and a reduction in polyunsaturated acids. Despite its current use as a source of biofuel, soybean oil contains an average of 25 % oleic acid and 13 % <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid, which negatively impacts its oxidative stability and freezing point, causing a high rate of nitrogen oxide emission. Gas chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry were conducted on soybean fatty acids from metabolically engineered <span class="trait">seed</span> extracts to determine the nature of the structural oleic and <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acids. The soybean genes <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FatB were placed under the control of the 35SCaMV constitutive promoter, introduced to soybean embryonic axes by particle bombardment and down-regulated using RNA interference technology. Results indicate that the metabolically engineered plants exhibited a significant increase in oleic acid (up to 94.58 %) and a reduction in <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid (to &lt;3 %) in their <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content.</span> No structural differences were observed between the fatty acids of the transgenic and non-transgenic oil extracts.

						KEY MESSAGE: fap 1 mutation is caused by a G174A change in <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> that disrupts a donor splice site recognition and creates a GATCTG motif that enhanced its expression. Soybean oil with reduced <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid <span class="trait">content</span> is desirable to reduce the health risks associated with consumption of this fatty acid. The objectives of this study were: to identify the genomic location of the reduced palmitate fap1 mutation, determine its molecular basis, estimate the amount of phenotypic variation in fatty acid composition explained by this locus, determine if there are epistatic interactions between the fap1 and fap nc loci and, determine if the fap1 mutation has pleiotropic effects on <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> oil and protein <span class="trait">content</span> in three soybean populations. This study detected two major QTL for 16:0 <span class="trait">content</span> located in chromosome 5 <span class="gene">(GmFATB1a,</span> fap nc) and chromosome 9 near BARCSOYSSR_09_1707 that explained, with their interaction, 66-94 % of the variation in 16:0 <span class="trait">content</span> in the three populations. Sequencing results of a putative candidate gene, <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA,</span> revealed a single unique polymorphism in the germplasm line C1726, which was predicted to disrupt the donor splice site recognition between exon one and intron one and produce a truncated KASIIIA protein. This G to A change also created the GATCTG motif that enhanced gene expression of the mutated <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> gene. Lines homozygous for the <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> mutation (fap1) had a significant reduction in 16:0, 18:0, and oil <span class="trait">content;</span> and an increase in unsaturated fatty acids <span class="trait">content.</span> There were significant epistatic interactions between <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> (fap1) and fap nc for 16:0 and oil contents, and <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> in two populations. In conclusion, the fap1 phenotype is caused by a single unique SNP in the <span class="gene">GmKASIIIA</span> gene.

						<span class="trait">Palmitic</span> acid is the most abundant (approx. 11% of total fatty acids) saturated fatty acid in conventional soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> oil. Increasing the saturated acid <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean oil improves its oxidative stability and plasticity. We have developed three soybean mutants with high <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid <span class="trait">content</span> by X-ray irradiation. In this study, we successfully identified the mutated sites of two of these high-palmitic-acid mutants, J10 and M22. PCR-based mutant analysis revealed that J10 has a 206,203-bp-long deletion that includes the <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> gene and 16 other predicted genes, and M22 has a 26-bp-long deletion in the sixth intron of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB.</span> The small deletion in M22 causes mis-splicing of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> transcripts, which should result in nonfunctional products. In addition, we designed co-dominant marker sets for these mutant alleles and confirmed the association of genotypes and <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid contents in F(2) seeds of J10 X M22. This information will be useful in breeding programs to develop novel soybean cultivars with improved <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid <span class="trait">content.</span> However, in the third mutant, KK7, we found no polymorphism in either <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> or <span class="gene">GmKASIIB,</span> which suggests that several unknown genes in addition to <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> and <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> may be involved in elevating the <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> oil.

						KEY MESSAGE: Identification and characterization of a 254-kb genomic deletion on a duplicated chromosome segment that resulted in a low level of <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid in soybean seeds using transcriptome sequencing. A large number of soybean genotypes varying in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil composition and <span class="trait">content</span> have been identified. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these variations is important for breeders to effectively utilize them as a genetic resource. Through design and application of a bioinformatics approach, we identified nine co-regulated gene clusters by comparing <span class="trait">seed</span> transcriptomes of nine soybean genotypes varying in oil composition and <span class="trait">content.</span> We demonstrated that four gene clusters in the genotypes M23, Jack and N0304-303-3 coincided with large-scale genome rearrangements. The co-regulated gene clusters in M23 and Jack mapped to a previously described 164-kb deletion and a copy number amplification of the <span class="gene">Rhg1</span> locus, respectively. The coordinately down-regulated gene clusters in N0304-303-3 were caused by a 254-kb deletion containing 19 genes including a fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B gene (FATB1a). This deletion was associated with reduced <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds and was the molecular cause of a previously reported nonfunctional <span class="gene">FATB1a</span> allele, fap nc . The M23 and N0304-304-3 deletions were located in duplicated genome segments retained from the Glycine-specific whole genome duplication that occurred 13 million years ago. The homoeologous genes in these duplicated regions shared a strong similarity in both their encoded protein sequences and transcript accumulation levels, suggesting that they may have conserved and important functions in seeds. The functional conservation of homoeologous genes may result in genetic redundancy and gene dosage effects for their associated <span class="trait">seed</span> traits, explaining why the large deletion did not cause lethal effects or completely eliminate <span class="trait">palmitic</span> acid in N0304-303-3.
