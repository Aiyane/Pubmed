					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The variability of North American and Asian strains and isolates of Soybean mosaic virus was investigated. First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products representing the coat protein (CP)-coding regions of 38 SMVs were analyzed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). Second, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence variability of the P1-coding region of 18 SMVs and the helper component/protease (HC/Pro) and CP-coding regions of 25 SMVs were assessed. The CP nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were the most similar and predicted phylogenetic relationships similar to those obtained from RFLP analysis. Neither RFLP nor sequence analyses of the CP-coding regions grouped the SMVs by geographical origin. The <span class="gene">P1</span> and HC/Pro sequences were more variable and separated the North American and Asian SMV isolates into two groups similar to previously reported differences in pathogenic diversity of the two sets of SMV isolates. The <span class="gene">P1</span> region was the most informative of the three regions analyzed. To assess the biological relevance of the sequence differences in the HC/Pro and CP coding regions, the transmissibility of 14 SMV isolates by <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> was tested. All field isolates of SMV were transmitted efficiently by A. <span class="trait">glycines,</span> but the laboratory isolates analyzed were transmitted poorly. The amino acid sequences from most, but not all, of the poorly transmitted isolates contained mutations in the aphid transmission-associated DAG and/or KLSC amino acid sequence motifs of CP and HC/Pro, respectively.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						SUMMARY Taxonomy: Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) is the type species of the genus Alfamovirus and belongs to the family Bromoviridae. In this family, the tripartite RNA genomes of bromo-, cucumo- and probably oleaviruses are infectious as such, whereas infection with the three genomic RNAs of alfamo- and ilarviruses requires addition to the inoculum of a few molecules of coat protein (CP) per RNA molecule. RNAs 1 and 2 encode the replicase proteins <span class="gene">P1</span> and P2, RNA 3 encodes the movement protein and CP. CP is translated from the subgenomic RNA 4. Physical properties: RNAs 1 (3.65 kb), 2 (2.6 kb) and 3 (2.2 kb) are separately encapsidated into bacilliform particles which are 19 nm wide and 35-56 nm long. In addition, the virus preparations contain spheroidal particles each containing two copies of RNA 4 (0.88 kb). Virus particles contain 16-17% RNA and are mainly stabilized by protein-RNA interactions. The 3'-termini of the viral RNAs contain a homologous sequence of 145 nucleotides that can adopt two alternative conformations: one represents a high-affinity binding site for CP, the other resembles a tRNA-like structure and is required for minus-strand promoter activity. Hosts: AMV mostly infects herbaceous plants, but several woody species are included in the natural host range. The experimental and natural host ranges include over 600 species in 70 families. At least 15 aphid species are known to transmit the virus in the stylet-borne or non-persistent manner. Economic importance: AMV is a significant pathogen in alfalfa and sweet clover and can spread from these forages to neighbouring crops like pepper, tobacco or soybean. The recent introduction of the soybean aphid <span class="trait">(Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines)</span> in the mid-west states of the USA has increased the incidence of AMV in soybean. AMV occurs world-wide in potato and is referred to as 'calico mosaic' because of its characteristic symptoms on the foliage. However, the economic importance of AMV in potato is limited.USEFUL WEBSITES: &lt;http://www.socgenmicrobiol.org.uk/JGV/080/1089/0801089A.PDF&gt; review paper; &lt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/10010001.htm&gt; host range and physical properties; &lt;http://mmtsb.scripps.edu/viper/1amv.html&gt; structural information.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Field experiments were performed over 3 yr to examine the impact of insecticide application timing to control soybean aphid, <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), populations and to prevent soybean <span class="trait">yield</span> losses. Experiments were conducted in early and late-planted soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Insecticide applications were made based on soybean growth stages. In 2001, applications were made at V1, V3, R2, and R3 growth stages; in 2002 and 2003, applications were made at R2, R3, and R4 stages. Additional treatments consisted of an unsprayed control and a multiple spray treatment that received insecticide applications at 7-10-d intervals. Soybean aphid densities were recorded throughout the growing season, and yields were measured. Soybean aphid populations varied considerably across years and planting dates. In general, late-planted soybean exhibited higher aphid pressure than early planted soybean, and experiments in 2002 had lower aphid numbers than those in 2001 and 2003. The multiple spray treatment significantly increased <span class="trait">yield</span> over the control in four of the six experiments, the exceptions being 2002 late planted and 2003 early planted. This suggests that soybean aphid populations were not large enough to cause <span class="trait">yield</span> losses in these two experiments. The R3 spray treatment increased <span class="trait">yield</span> in three of the six experiments (2001 late planting, 2002 early planting, and 2003 late planting), the R2 spray treatment increased <span class="trait">yield</span> in two of six experiments (2001 and 2003 late plantings), and the <span class="gene">V1</span> application increased <span class="trait">yield</span> over the control in the 2001 late-planted experiment. Results suggest that when aphid populations are high insecticide applications made at R2 and R3 plant stages are most effective in preventing <span class="trait">yield</span> loss.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Induced volatiles provide a signal to foraging predatory insects about the location of their prey. In Iowa, early in the growing season of soybean, Glycine max, many predacious seven-spotted lady beetles, Coccinella septempunctata, were observed on plants with heavy infestations of soybean aphid, <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines.</span> We studied whether the attraction of this beetle is caused by the release of specific volatile compounds of soybean plants infested by aphids. Volatile compounds emitted by soybean plants infested by aphids were compared with those of undamaged, uninfested, and artificially damaged plants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed consistent differences in the profiles of volatile compounds between aphid-infested soybean plants and undamaged ones. Significantly more methyl salicylate was released from infested plants at both the <span class="gene">V1</span> and <span class="gene">V2</span> plant growth stages. However, release patterns of two other induced plant volatiles, (D)-limonene and (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, differed between the two plant growth stages. Gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection of volatile extracts from infested soybean plants showed that methyl salicylate elicited significant electrophysiological responses in C. septempunctata. In field tests, traps baited with methyl salicylate were highly attractive to adult C. septempunctata, whereas 2-phenylethanol was most attractive to the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea and syrphid flies. Another common lady beetle, the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, showed no preference for the compounds. These results indicate that C. septempunctata may use methyl salicylate as the olfactory cue for prey location. We also tested the attractiveness of some selected soybean volatiles to alate soybean aphids in the field, and results showed that traps baited with benzaldehyde caught significantly higher numbers of aphids.

						Chitin synthases are critical enzymes for synthesis of chitin and thus for subsequent growth and development in insects. We identified the cDNA of chitin synthase gene (CHS) in <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines,</span> the soybean aphid, which is a serious pest of soybean. The full-length cDNA of <span class="gene">CHS</span> in A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> (AyCHS) was 5802 bp long with an open reading frame of 4704 bp that encoded for a 1567 amino acid residues protein. The predicted AyCHS protein had a molecular mass of 180.05 kDa and its amino acid sequence contained all the signature motifs (EDR, QRRRW and TWGTR) of chitin synthases. The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that AyCHS was expressed in all major tissues (gut, fat body and integument); however, it had the highest expression in integument (~3.5 fold compared to gut). Interestingly, the expression of AyCHS in developing embryos was nearly 7 fold higher compared to adult integument, which probably is a reflection of embryonic molts in hemimetabolus insects. Expression analysis in different developmental stages of A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> revealed a consistent AyCHS expression in all stages. Further, through leaf dip bioassay, we tested the effect of diflubenzuron (DFB, Dimilin ®), a chitin-synthesis inhibitor, on A. <span class="trait">glycines'</span> survival, fecundity and body weight. When fed with soybean leaves previously dipped in 50 ppm DFB solution, A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> nymphs suffered significantly higher mortality compared to control. A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> nymphs feeding on diflubenzuron treated leaves showed a slightly enhanced expression (1.67 fold) of AyCHS compared to nymphs on untreated leaves. We discussed the potential applications of the current study to develop novel management strategies using chitin-synthesis inhibitors and using RNAi by knocking down AyCHS expression.

						Priming can improve plant innate capability to deal with the stresses caused by both biotic and abiotic factors. In this study, the effect of DL-&#x003b2;-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA) against <italic> <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> Matsumura, the soybean aphid (SA) was evaluated. We found that 25 mM BABA as a root drench had minimal adverse impact on plant growth and also efficiently protected soybean from SA infestation. In both choice and non-choice tests, SA number was significantly decreased to a low level in soybean seedlings drenched with 25 mM BABA compared to the control counterparts. BABA treatment resulted in a significant increase in the activities of several defense enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), chitinase (CHI), and &#x003b2;-1, 3-glucanase (GLU) in soybean seedlings attacked by aphid. Meanwhile, the induction of 15 defense-related genes by aphid, such as <italic> AOS </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">CHS</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">MMP2</span> </italic> , <italic> NPR1-1 </italic> , <italic> NPR1-2 </italic> , and <italic> PR </italic> genes, were significantly augmented in BABA-treated soybean seedlings. Our study suggest that BABA application is a promising way to enhance soybean <span class="trait">resistance</span> against SA.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As the markers of systemic acquired <span class="trait">resistance,</span> <span class="gene">CHI</span> and GLU belong to the PR-2 and PR-3 families and catalyze the hydrolysis of chitin and &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-VanLoon2"> [47] </xref> . SA attack stimulated the activities of the two enzymes, whereas BABA treatment led to more robust increases ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085142-g004"> Figure 4D and 4E </xref> ; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0085142.s004"> Table S4 </xref> ). Consistently, augmented induction of the enzyme activities by aphid feeding were observed in soybean plants drenched with BABA compared with the control counterparts.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In addition to these defense genes and enzymes, other genes participated in <span class="trait">resistance</span> against SA, such as allene oxide synthase ( <italic> AOS </italic> ), matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( <italic> <span class="gene">MMP2</span> </italic> ) and chalcone synthase ( <italic> <span class="gene">CHS</span> </italic> ), were also upregulated by BABA. <italic> AOS </italic> is involved in oxylipin biosynthesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Kongrit1"> [36] </xref> . Oxylipins are known as antibiotic factors and defense stimulating signal molecules in the plant biotic stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Ble1"> [76] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Prost1"> [77] </xref> . Accumulation of oxylipins was found both in phloem sap and aphids feeding on plants, thus oxylipins may play a direct role in plant-aphid interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Harmel1"> [78] </xref> . We also found the up-regulation of <italic> AOS </italic> by aphid feeding, suggesting its possible role in soybean against SA. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( <italic> <span class="gene">MMP2</span> </italic> ) transcript accumulated rapidly following infection with oomycete pathogen <italic> Phytophthora sojae </italic> or the bacterial pathogen <italic> Pseudomonas syringae </italic> pv. <italic> glycinea </italic> and was also activated in response to wounding and dehydration in soybean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Liu2"> [39] </xref> . <italic> <span class="gene">MMP2</span> </italic> was increased in soybean leaves and seeds in response to the fungal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Upchurch2"> [79] </xref> . In our study, <italic> <span class="gene">MMP2</span> </italic> was found to participate in pest defense such as SA, revealing its broad-spectrum <span class="trait">resistance</span> in biotic stress. <italic> <span class="gene">CHS</span> </italic> is an important gene in phenylpropanoid pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Akada1"> [37] </xref> and its upregulation was accompanied by an increased flavonoid content in sunflower <span class="trait">resistance</span> against the downy mildew pathogen. Interestingly, two QTLs (qRa_1, LG A2 and qRa_2, LG F) were recently discovered to be linked to <span class="trait">resistance</span> to soybean aphid in &#x02018;Zhongdou 27&#x02019;, a cultivar with high isoflavone content, and these two QTLs were concurrently associated with high isoflavone content. Defense against SA in &#x02018;zhongdou 27&#x02019; was likely contributed by isoflavone-mediated antibiosis process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0085142-Meng1"> [80] </xref> . These evidences suggest that one of mechanisms underlying BABA-induced <span class="trait">resistance</span> against SA in soybean may be dependent on the increase of isoflavone and flavonoid content. More experimental data are needed to substantiate this hypothesis.

						Using blast2go, a total of 11,311 <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> transcripts were annotated. Observed gene ontology (GO) terms for each domain (biological process, molecular function and cellular component) were widely distributed into different categories. A comparison of percent mappings to each GO category between <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> and <italic> A. pisum </italic> revealed nearly identical distributions for both aphid species (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"> 1 </xref> D). The majority of transcripts assigned to the &#x02018;biological process&#x02019; domain were involved in cellular, regulatory, developmental, and reproductive activities, while the largest part of transcripts under &#x02018;molecular function&#x02019; domain were predicted to have catalytic, binding and transporter functions. Through KEGG-based pathway analysis, <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> transcripts were assigned to one or more of 129 total pathways (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media"> 2 </xref> ). The majority of transcripts were assigned to pathways for metabolism of nitrogenous compounds (e.g. purine, pyrimidine, amino acids) and sugars (e.g. glucose). Interestingly, a total of 194 transcripts were assigned to 19 pathways for xenobiotic degradation and metabolism. Among them, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in metabolism (such as <span class="gene">P450</span> enzymes) were the most abundant.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						RNA-Seq analysis revealed several genes induced in <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> fed with <italic> Rag1 </italic> -soybean potentially involved in all three phases of xenobiotic metabolism. For phase I, 13 genes related to cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> (represented by 15 transcripts), were up-regulated. These putative <span class="gene">P450</span> genes exhibited a higher transcript abundance ranging from 0.89-3.43 fold (log2 scale) in <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> on <italic> Rag1- </italic> soybean compared to those fed with the susceptible plant (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ). These genes were featured in 8 enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (Fisher test, FDR corrected <italic> P </italic> &#x0003c;0.05; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media"> 7 </xref> ). Nine out of 13 up-regulated putative <span class="gene">P450</span> genes belonged to the CYP6 family from the CYP3 clan. For phase II, genes similar to GST, &#x003b3;-glutamyltranspeptidase, COE, and sulfotransferase showed increased transcript abundance (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ). For phase III, transcript levels of 10 predicted ABC transporter genes, named <italic> AyABC1 </italic> to <italic> AyABC10 </italic> , were higher in <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> fed with <italic> Rag1 </italic> . Genes potentially involved in the cellular uptake (scavenger receptors <italic> AySR1 </italic> - <italic> AySR4 </italic> ) and transfer (nose resistant to fluoxetine <italic> AyNRF1 </italic> - <italic> AyNRF7 </italic> ) of xenobiotics were also up-regulated (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ). Other putative stress response genes, including 9 heat shock proteins ( <italic> hsp </italic> ) and 5 takeout ( <italic> to </italic> ) genes showed higher transcript levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media"> 8 </xref> ). Up-regulated <italic> hsp </italic> and <italic> to </italic> genes exhibited fold changes (log2 scale) that ranged from 1.76-3.24 and 1.00-1.92, respectively. <table-wrap id="Tab2"> <label> Table 2 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Xenobiotic response and metabolism genes up-regulated in </bold> <bold> <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> </bold> <bold> fed with </bold> <bold> <italic> Rag </italic> </bold> <bold> 1 </bold> <bold> <italic> - </italic> </bold> <bold> soybean </bold>

						Among 13 induced <span class="gene">P450</span> genes in <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> feeding on <italic> Rag1 </italic> -soybean, 9 belonged to the CYP6 family of CYP3 clan (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ). Members in this family have previously shown similar responses in other insects, and are specifically involved in metabolism of numerous PSMs. For example, CYP6B enzymes detoxify PSMs in <italic> Papilio polyxenes </italic> , <italic> P. multicaudatus </italic> , and <italic> Helicoverpa zea </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53"> 53 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54"> 54 </xref> ]. Interestingly, the induction of <span class="gene">P450</span> and other xenobiotic metabolism genes revealed in current study occurred in an incompatible interaction (resistant plant-avirulent insect). In fact, the induction of xenobiotic response genes by PSM exposure is thought to be the first step leading to the eventual detoxification and virulence adaptation because mutations responsible for higher enzymatic potency toward a xenobiotic substrate are more likely to be selected if these occur in inducible genes (that overproduces the enzyme) rather than in constitutive genes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55"> 55 </xref> ]. Our findings strongly indicate a vital role for P450s in the coevolutionary history and apparent &#x02018;arms race&#x02019; between <italic> A. <span class="trait">glycines</span> </italic> and soybean, and future investigation into role of xenobiotic response machinery may reveal adaptation mechanism in virulent biotypes.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> Matsumura is an important pest of soybean in Asia and North America. Hymenoptera parasitoids play a key role in the control of the soybean aphid. The correct identification of parasitoids is a critical step that precedes the assessment of their potential biological control agents. Accurate identification of the majority of the species attacking the soybean aphid often requires elaborate specimen preparation and expert taxonomic knowledge. In this study, we facilitated the identification of soybean aphid parasitoids by applying a DNA barcoding approach following a preliminary morphological identification. We generated DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial <span class="gene">COI</span> gene and the D2 region of 28S rDNA to assess the genetic variation within and between parasitoid species emerging from the soybean aphid in China. Fifteen Hymenoptera parasitoid species belonging to 10 genera of five families were identified with little intra-specific variation (0.09% ± 0.06% for 28S and 0.36% ± 0.18% for COI) and large inter-specific divergence (30.46% ± 3.42% for 28S and 20.4% ± 1.20% for COI).

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean aphid, <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is the most economically important insect pest of soybean in the north central United States. Scouting-based integrated pest management (IPM) programs could become more efficient and more widely adopted by using plant spectral reflectance to estimate soybean aphid injury. Our objective was to determine whether plant spectral reflectance is affected by soybean aphid feeding. Field trials were conducted in 2013 and 2014 using caged plots. Early-, late-, and noninfested treatments were established to create a gradient of soybean aphid pressure. Whole-plant soybean aphid densities were recorded weekly. Measurements of plant spectral reflectance occurred on two sample dates per year. Simple linear regression models were used to test the effect of cumulative aphid-days (CAD) on plant spectral reflectance at 680 nm (RED) and 800 nm (NIR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and relative chlorophyll content. Data indicated that CAD had no effect on canopy-level RED reflectance, but CAD decreased canopy-level <span class="gene">NIR</span> reflectance and NDVI. Canopy- and leaf-level measurements typically indicated similar plant spectral response to increasing CAD. CAD generally had no effect on relative chlorophyll content. The present study provides the first documentation that remote sensing holds potential for detecting changes in plant spectral reflectance induced by soybean aphid. The use of plant spectral reflectance in soybean aphid management may assist future IPM programs to reduce sampling costs and prevent prophylactic insecticide sprays.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The soybean aphid <span class="trait">(Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> Matsumura) is one of the most important insect pests of soybeans in the North-central region of the US. It has been hypothesized that aphids avoid effective defenses by inhibition of jasmonate-regulated plant responses. Given the role fatty acids play in jasmonate-induced plant defenses, we analyzed the fatty acid profile of soybean leaves and seeds from aphid-infested plants. Aphid infestation reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in leaves with a concomitant increase in palmitic acid. In seeds, a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with an increase in stearic acid and oleic acid. Soybean plants challenged with the brown stem rot fungus or with soybean cyst nematodes did not present changes in fatty acid levels in leaves or seeds, indicating that the changes induced by aphids are not a general response to pests. One of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid, is the precursor of jasmonate; thus, these changes in fatty acid metabolism may be examples of "metabolic hijacking" by the aphid to avoid the induction of effective defenses. Based on the changes in fatty acid levels observed in seeds and leaves, we hypothesize that aphids potentially induce interference in the fatty acid desaturation pathway, likely reducing <span class="gene">FAD2</span> and FAD6 activity that leads to a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Our data support the idea that aphids block jasmonate-dependent defenses by reduction of the hormone precursor.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are plant-specific calcium sensors that play important roles in various aspects of plant physiology. Here, we investigated phylogenic relationships, chromosomal locations, gene structures, and tissue-specific, herbivory- and drought-induced expression profiles of soybean (Glycine max) <span class="gene">GmCDPKs.</span> Fifty <span class="gene">GmCDPK</span> genes were identified, which phylogenetically grouped into 4 distinct clusters and distributed across 13 sub-clusters. Individual classes of <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> harbor highly conserved mRNA splicing sites, and their exon numbers and lengths were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that at least 13 ancestral <span class="gene">CDPK</span> genes had emerged before the split of monocots and eudicots. Gene expression analysis indicated that several <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> were tissue-specific expressed. <span class="gene">GmCDPKs'</span> transcript levels changed after wounding, exhibited specific expression patterns after simulated Spodoptera exigua feeding or soybean aphid <span class="trait">(Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines)</span> herbivory, and were largely independent of the phytohormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. The most pronounced transcriptional responses were detected after <span class="trait">drought</span> and abscisic acid treatments with more than half of all <span class="gene">GmCDPKs</span> being upregulated, suggesting their important roles during abiotic stress responses in soybean. Our data provide an important foundation for further functional dissection of <span class="gene">GmCDPKs,</span> especially in the context of soybean-insect interactions and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress adaptation.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system that allows them to recognize invading pathogens by specialized receptors. Carbohydrate-binding proteins or lectins are part of this immune system and especially the lectins that reside in the nucleocytoplasmic compartment are known to be implicated in biotic and abiotic stress responses. The class of Nictaba-like lectins (NLL) groups all proteins with homology to the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lectin, known as a stress-inducible lectin. Here we focus on two Nictaba homologs from soybean (Glycine max), referred to as <span class="gene">GmNLL1</span> and <span class="gene">GmNLL2.</span> Confocal laser scanning microscopy of fusion constructs with the green fluorescent protein either transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves or stably transformed in tobacco BY-2 suspension cells revealed a nucleocytoplasmic localization for the <span class="gene">GmNLLs</span> under study. RT-qPCR analysis of the transcript levels for the Nictaba-like lectins in soybean demonstrated that the genes are expressed in several tissues throughout the development of the plant. Furthermore, it was shown that salt treatment, Phytophthora sojae infection and <span class="trait">Aphis</span> <span class="trait">glycines</span> infestation trigger the expression of particular NLL genes. Stress experiments with Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the NLLs from soybean yielded an enhanced tolerance of the plant toward bacterial infection (Pseudomonas syringae), insect infestation (Myzus persicae) and salinity. Our data showed a better performance of the transgenic lines compared to wild type plants, indicating that the NLLs from soybean are implicated in the stress response. These data can help to further elucidate the physiological importance of the Nictaba-like lectins from soybean, which can ultimately lead to the design of crop plants with a better tolerance to changing environmental conditions.
