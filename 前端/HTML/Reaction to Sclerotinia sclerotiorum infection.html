				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The necrotrophic fungal pathogen <span class="trait">Sclerotinia</span> <span class="trait">sclerotiorum</span> secretes oxalic acid and endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG) in host plants. Oxalic acid acidifies the plant tissue <span class="trait">to</span> values more suitable <span class="trait">to</span> endo-PG activity. However, we observed that the infected soybean seedlings possessed a pH of 3.8, which is below that optimal for endo-PG activity (4.5 <span class="trait">to</span> 5.0). We investigated, therefore, the effects of pH (from 5.0 <span class="trait">to</span> 3.6) and oxalate (5 <span class="trait">to</span> 20 mM) on the activity of the major basic endo-PG (PGb) and towards an acidic endo-PG (PGa) secreted by S. <span class="trait">sclerotiorum</span> during soybean <span class="trait">infection.</span> We verified that only PGb activity is stimulated by oxalate, while at the lowest pH levels, PGa escapes the inhibition of a soybean polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP). These results, performed on polygalacturonic acid, were apparently consistent with data obtained from studies with soybean hypocotyl segments, in which PGb activity was increased by oxalate and PGa maintained its activity also at pH 3.6, possibly because at this pH the PGIP contained in the plant tissue is inactive. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain <span class="trait">reaction</span> analysis showed that, during soybean <span class="trait">infection,</span> the expression of the putative <span class="gene">pga</span> gene is delayed in comparison <span class="trait">to</span> the basic one. The different temporal expressions of the two endo-PGs and their differing responses <span class="trait">to</span> pH, oxalate, and PGIP seem <span class="trait">to</span> be consistent with a possible maximization of the fungal PG activity in the host tissue.
