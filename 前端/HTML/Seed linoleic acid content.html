				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The Delta-12 oleate desaturase gene (FAD2-1), which converts oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> into <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid,</span> is the key enzyme determining the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> composition of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil. In this study, we inhibited the expression of endogenous Delta-12 oleate desaturase <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> gene by using antisense RNA in soybean Williams 82. By employing the soybean cotyledonary-node method, a part of the cDNA of soybean <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> 801 bp was cloned for the construction of a pCAMBIA3300 vector under the soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> promoter BCSP. Leaf painting, LibertyLink strip, PCR, Southern blot, qRT-PCR, and fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> analysis were used to detect the insertion and expression of <span class="gene">GmFad2-1b</span> in the transgenic soybean lines. The results indicate that the metabolically engineered plants exhibited a significant increase in oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> (up to 51.71%) and a reduction in palmitic <span class="trait">acid</span> (to &lt;3%) in their <span class="trait">seed</span> oil <span class="trait">content.</span> No structural differences were observed between the fatty acids of the transgenic and the nontransgenic oil extracts.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						α-Linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of ω6:ω3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> and to reduce the ratio of <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (LA) to ALA. Six ω-3 (Δ-15) fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, GluC, or a Ubi-1 promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g⁻¹ to 8.57 mg g⁻¹ and 10.06 mg g⁻¹, respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of high ALA <span class="trait">content</span> was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2/3</span> and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA <span class="trait">content</span> in rice seeds. The GluC promoter is advantageous compared with Ubi-1 in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the sn-2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of high ALA rice would meet &gt;80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The alteration of fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> profiles in soybean to improve soybean oil quality has been a long-time goal of soybean researchers. Soybean oil with elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of soybean oil compared to other oils. In the lipid biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase 2 (FAD2) is responsible for the conversion of oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> precursors to <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> precursors in developing soybean seeds. Two genes encoding <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were identified to be expressed specifically in seeds during embryogenesis and have been considered to hold an important role in controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> A total of 22 soybean plant introduction (PI) lines identified to have an elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> were characterized for sequence mutations in the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. PI 603452 was found to contain a deletion of a nucleotide in the second exon of FAD2-1A. These important SNPs were used in developing molecular marker genotyping assays. The assays appear to be a reliable and accurate tool to identify the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genotype of wild-type and mutant plants. PI 603452 was subsequently crossed with PI 283327, a soybean line that has a mutation in FAD2-1B. Interestingly, soybean lines carrying both homozygous insertion/deletion mutation (indel) <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> alleles and mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles have an average of 82-86% oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> compared to 20% in conventional soybean, and low levels of <span class="trait">linoleic</span> and linolenic acids. The newly identified indel mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene offers a simple method for the development of high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> commercial soybean varieties.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Alpha-linolenic acid(ALA, C18:3delta9,12,15 ) is an essential fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> which has many sanitary functions to human. However, its contents in diets are often not enough. In plants, omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturases(FAD) catalyze <span class="trait">linoleic</span> acid(LA, C18:2delta9,12) into ALA. The <span class="trait">seed</span> oil of Glycine max contains high level of ALA. To investigate the functions of Glycine max omega-3FAD, the cDNA of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C was amplified by RT-PCR from immature seeds, then cloned into the shuttle expression vector p416 to generate the recombinant vector p4GFAD3C. The resulting vector was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae K601 throuth LiAc method. The positive clones were screened on the CM(Ura-) medium and identified by PCR, and then cultured in CM (Ura-) liquid medium with exogenous LA in 20 degrees C for three days. The intracellular fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> composition of the engineering strain Kp416 and Kp4GFAD3C was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A novel peak in strain Kp4GFAD3C was detected,which was not detectable in control, Comparison of the retention times of the newly yielded peak with that of authentic standard indicated that the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> is ALA. The <span class="trait">content</span> of ALA reached to 3.1% of the total fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> in recombinant strain, the <span class="trait">content</span> of LA correspondingly decreased from 22% to 16.2% by contrast. It was suggested that the protein encoded by <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C can specifically catalyze 18 carbon PUFA substrate of LA into ALA by taking off hydrogen atoms at delta15 location. In this study, we expressed a Glycine max omega-3 fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase gene in S. cerevisiae; An efficient and economical yeast expressing system(K601-p416 system) which is suitable for the expression of FAD was built.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> is one of the major factors influencing the quality of vegetable oils. Edible oils rich in monounsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> provide improved oil stability, flavor, and nutrition for human and animal consumption. In plants, the microsomal omega-6 desaturase-catalyzed pathway is the primary route of production of polyunsaturated lipids. We report the isolation of two different cDNA sequences, <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FAD2-2, encoding microsomal omega-6 desaturase in soybeans and the characterization of their developmental and temperature regulation. The <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is strongly expressed in developing seeds, whereas the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene is constitutively expressed in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. Thus, the <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> gene-encoded omega-6 desaturase appears to be responsible for production of polyunsaturated fatty acids within membrane lipids in both vegetative tissues and developing seeds. The seed-specifically expressed <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene is likely to play a major role in controlling conversion of oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> to <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> within storage lipids during <span class="trait">seed</span> development. In both soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> and leaf tissues, <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> and linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> levels gradually increase as temperature decreases. However, the levels of transcripts for FAD2-1, FAD2-2, and the plastidial omega-6 desaturase gene (FAD 6) do not increase at low temperature. These results suggest that the elevated polyunsaturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in developing soybean seeds grown at low temperature are not due to the enhanced expression of omega-6 desaturase genes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soya bean (Glycine max) plants overexpressing a seed-specific bacterial phytoene synthase gene from Pantoea ananatis modified to target to plastids accumulated 845 μg β carotene g(-1) dry <span class="trait">seed</span> weight with a desirable 12:1 ratio of β to α. The β carotene accumulating seeds exhibited a shift in oil composition increasing oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> with a concomitant decrease in <span class="trait">linoleic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> and an increase in <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> by at least 4% (w/w). Elevated β-carotene accumulating soya bean cotyledons contain 40% the amount of abscisic <span class="trait">acid</span> compared to nontransgenic cotyledons. Proteomic and nontargeted metabolomic analysis of the mid-maturation β-carotene cotyledons compared to the nontransgenic did not reveal any significant differences that would account for the altered phenotypes of both elevated oleate and protein <span class="trait">content.</span> Transcriptomic analysis, confirmed by RT-PCR, revealed a number of significant differences in ABA-responsive transcripton factor gene expression in the <span class="gene">crtB</span> transgenics compared to nontransgenic cotyledons of the same maturation stage. The altered <span class="trait">seed</span> composition traits seem to be attributed to altered ABA hormone levels varying transcription factor expression. The elevated β-carotene, oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> and protein traits in the β-carotene soya beans confer a substantial additive nutritional quality to soya beans.
