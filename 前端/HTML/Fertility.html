						The <span class="gene">W4</span> locus in soybean encodes a dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR2) that regulates pigmentation patterns in flowers and hypocotyl. The mutable w4-m allele that governs variegated flowers has arisen through insertion of a CACTA-type transposable element, Tgm9, in DFR2. In the w4-m line, reversion from variegated to purple flower indicates excision of Tgm9, and its insertion at a new locus. Previously, we have identified a male-sterile, female-sterile mutant among the selfed progenies of a revertant plant carrying only purple flowers. Co-segregation between Tgm9 and the sterility phenotype suggested that the mutant was generated by insertion of Tgm9 at the St8 locus. The transposon was localized to exon 10 of <span class="gene">Glyma.16G072300</span> that shows high identity to the MER3 DNA helicase involved in crossing over. Molecular analysis of fertile branches from two independent revertant plants confirmed precise excision of Tgm9 from the st8 allele, which restored <span class="trait">fertility.</span> In soybean, the gene is expressed in flower-buds, trifoliate leaves and stem. Phylogenetic analysis placed St8 in a clade with the Arabidopsis and rice MER3 suggesting that St8 is most likely the orthologous MER3 soybean gene. This study established the utility of Tgm9 in gene identification as well as in forward and reverse genetics studies.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this investigation we have shown the utility of <italic> Tgm9 </italic> in isolating a MSFS gene, <italic> St8 </italic> , in soybean. <italic> Tgm9 </italic> is an active CACTA-type transposable element highly similar to <italic> Tgmt* </italic> which was isolated from the soybean <italic> t* </italic> allele [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref031" ref-type="bibr"> 31 </xref> ]. <italic> Tgm9 </italic> is a low copy transposable element [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref032" ref-type="bibr"> 32 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref033" ref-type="bibr"> 33 </xref> ]. <italic> Tgm9 </italic> is known to produce two distinct transposases through alternate splicing and may have similar excision mechanism as <italic> En/Spm </italic> [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref034" ref-type="bibr"> 34 </xref> ]. It occasionally fractures during excision resulting in stable mutations [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref017" ref-type="bibr"> 17 </xref> ]. In the <italic> w4-m </italic> line, the element is located in intron 2 of the <italic> <span class="gene">DFR2</span> </italic> gene involved in anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis in petals and hypocotyls [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> ]. Due to the presence of the element in this gene, pigment biosynthesis is interrupted and white flowers are produced in this mutant line. <italic> Tgm9 </italic> is a highly active element, and upon precise or imprecise excision from the flower color gene, purple flower color is developed either in petal sectors (excision of the element in the somatic tissues; somatic excision) or in entire petals (excision of the element in progenitor cells that led to flower development) [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> ]. When the entire flower is purple, some of the progenies developed from this flower bear only purple flowers; and these events are in germinal cells and are called germinal revertants. From the progeny of a germinal revertant carrying purple flowers, a MSFS mutant was identified and the mutant <span class="trait">fertility</span> gene was mapped to the <italic> St8 </italic> locus on molecular linkage group J [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref011" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ]. The sterility gene was temporarily named as <italic> st_A06-321 </italic> .
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We conducted a complementation test to confirm that <italic> st_A06-321 </italic> and <italic> St8 </italic> are allelic. The mutant <italic> st_A06-321 </italic> allele was presumably generated from insertion of <italic> Tgm9 </italic> excised from the <italic> <span class="gene">W4</span> </italic> locus. Earlier we have shown co-segregation of the mutant <italic> st_A06-321 </italic> allele with a <italic> Tgm9 </italic> insertion [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref011" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ]. We have cloned the <italic> St8 </italic> gene using <italic> Tgm9 </italic> . This is the first <span class="trait">fertility</span> gene cloned in soybean. Previously, we reported candidates for the <span class="trait">fertility</span> gene, <italic> St8 </italic> based on fine mapping of the <italic> St8 </italic> region containing a MSFS gene [ <xref rid="pone.0150482.ref011" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ]. Sequencing of the <italic> Tgm9 </italic> -insertion site in the MSFS mutant established that one of the five candidate genes, <italic> Glyma </italic> . <italic> 16G072300 </italic> , that encodes MER3 DNA helicase is most likely the <italic> St8 </italic> gene, which regulates the male and female <span class="trait">fertility</span> in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: The MADS-box transcription factors play fundamental roles in reproductive developmental control. Although the roles of many plant MADS-box proteins have been extensively studied, there are almost no functional studies of them in soybean, an important protein and oil crop in the world. In addition, the MADS-box protein orthologs may have species-specific functions. Controlling male <span class="trait">fertility</span> is an important goal in plant hybrid breeding but is difficult in some crops like soybean. The morphological structure of soybean flowers prevents the cross-pollination. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for floral development will aid in engineering new sterile materials that could be applied in hybrid breeding programs in soybean. RESULT: Through microarray analysis, a flower-enriched gene in soybean was selected and designated as <span class="gene">GmMADS28.</span> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> belongs to AGL9/SEP subfamily of MADS-box proteins, localized in nucleus and showed specific expression patterns in floral meristems as well as stamen and petal primordia. Expression of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> in the stamens and petals of a soybean mutant NJS-10Hfs whose stamens are converted into petals was higher than in those of wild-type plants. Constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> in tobacco promoted early flowering and converted stamens and sepals to petals. Interestingly, transgenic plants increased the numbers of sepal, petal and stamen from five to six and exhibited male sterility due to the shortened and curly filaments and the failure of pollen release from the anthers. The ectopic expression of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> was found to be sufficient to activate expression of tobacco homologs of SOC1, LEAFY, AGL8/FUL, and DEF. In addition, we observed the interactions of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> with soybean homologs of SOC1, AP1, and AGL8/FUL proteins. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed the roles of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> in the regulation of floral organ number and petal identity. Compared to other plant AGL9/SEP proteins, <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> specifically regulates floral organ number, filament length and pollen release. The sterility caused by the ectopic expression of <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> offers a promising way to genetically produce new sterile material that could potentially be applied in the hybrid breeding of crops like soybean.

						The molecular regulations on reproductive development in soybean are largely unknown. Additionally, controlling the <span class="trait">fertility</span> is an important goal in plant hybrid breeding but is difficult in some crops including soybean. Through microarray analysis, a flower-enriched gene <italic> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> </italic> encoding a MADS-box transcription factor was cloned from soybean. <italic> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> </italic> belongs to E-type gene and may play a wide role in reproductive development. It was observed that constitutive expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> </italic> in tobacco caused a number of reproductive development changes, including early flowering, conversion of stamens and sepals to petals, increased numbers of sepal, petal and stamens and carpel-like sepals. In particular, ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> </italic> caused sterility due to the shortened and curly stalks and the failure of pollen release from the anthers. <italic> <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> </italic> is thus a potential target gene for engineering the male sterile plants. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmMADS28</span> was found to activate the tobacco homologs of <italic> SOC1 </italic> , <italic> LEAFY </italic> , <italic> AGL8/FUL </italic> and <italic> DEF </italic> and interact with soybean homologs of SOC1, <span class="gene">AP1</span> and AGL8/FUL proteins, which provides the new clues in understanding the functional mechanisms for E-type proteins in plant reproductive development.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In soybean, the <span class="gene">W4</span> gene encoding dihydroflavonol-4-reductase controls anthocyanin pigment biosynthesis in flowers. The mutant allele, w4-m, is characterized by variegated flowers and was evolved from the insertion of an endogenous transposable element, Tgm9, in intron II of the <span class="gene">W4</span> gene. In the w4-m mutant line, reversion of the unstable allele from variegated to normal purple flower in revertants would indicate Tgm9's excision accompanied by its insertion into a second locus. We identified a male-sterile, female-sterile mutant from such germinal revertant bearing purple flowers. The objectives of our investigation were to map the sterility locus, identify candidate genes for the male-fertile, female-fertile phenotype, and then determine if sterility is associated with the insertion of Tgm9 in the sterility locus. We used bulked segregant analysis to map the locus to molecular linkage group J (chromosome 16). Fine mapping enabled us to flank the locus to a 62-kb region that contains only five predicted genes. One of the genes in that region, <span class="gene">Glyma16g07850.1,</span> codes for a helicase. A rice homolog of this gene has been shown to control crossing over and <span class="trait">fertility</span> phenotype. Thus, <span class="gene">Glyma16g07850.1</span> is most likely the gene regulating the male and female <span class="trait">fertility</span> phenotype in soybean. DNA blot analysis of the segregating individuals for Tgm9 showed perfect association between sterility and the presence of the transposon. Most likely, the sterility mutation was caused by the insertion of Tgm9. The transposable element should facilitate identification of the male- and female-fertility gene. Characterization of the <span class="trait">fertility</span> gene will provide vital molecular insight on the reproductive biology of soybean and other plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The alternative oxidase (AOX) is a cyanide-resistant oxidase that provides an alternative outlet for electrons from the respiratory electron transport chain embedded in the inner membrane of plant mitochondria. Examination of soybean (Glycine max) plants carrying a <span class="gene">GmAOX2b</span> antisense gene showed AOX to have a central role in reproductive development and fecundity. In three independently transformed antisense lines, seed set was reduced by 16% to 43%, whereas ovule abortion increased by 1.2- to 1.7-fold when compared with nontransgenic transformation control plants. Reduced fecundity was associated with reductions in whole leaf cyanide-resistant, salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration and net photosynthesis, but there was no change in total respiration in the dark. The frequency of potential fertilization events was reduced by at least one-third in the antisense plants as a likely consequence of prefertilization defects. Pistils of the antisense plants contained a higher proportion of immature-sized, nonfertile embryo sacs compared with nontransgenic control plants. Increased rates of pollen abortion in vivo and reduced rates of pollen germination in vitro suggested that the antisense gene compromised pollen development and function. Reciprocal crosses between antisense and nontransgenic plants revealed that pollen produced by antisense plants was less active in fertilization. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that AOX expression has an important role in determining normal gametophyte development and function.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is self-pollinated. To produce large quantities of hybrid seed, insect-mediated cross-pollination is necessary. An efficient nuclear male-sterile system for hybrid seed production would benefit from molecular and/or phenotypic markers linked to male fertility/sterility loci to facilitate early identification of phenotypes. Nuclear male-sterile, female-fertile ms3 mutant is a single recessive gene and displays high outcrossed seed set with pollinators. Our objective was to map the ms3 locus. A segregating population of 150 F(2) plants from Minsoy (PI 27890) x T284H, Ms3ms3 (A00-68), was screened with 231 simple sequence repeat markers. The ms3 locus mapped to molecular linkage group (MLG) D1b <span class="gene">(Gm02)</span> and is flanked by markers Satt157 and Satt542, with a distance of 3.7 and 12.3 cM, respectively. Female-partial sterile-1 (Fsp1) and the Midwest Oilseed male-sterile (msMOS) mutants previously were located on MLG D1b. msMOS and Fsp1 are independent genes located very close to each other. All 3 genes are located in close proximity of Satt157. We believe that this is the first report of clustering of fertility-related genes in plants. Characterization of these closely linked genes may help in understanding the evolutionary relationship among them.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in maintaining the <span class="trait">fertility</span> and quality of soils in agricultural ecosystems. Few studies have examined the effects of decomposition on DOM sorption and chemical characteristics. This study investigated the sorption to goethite (alpha-FeOOH) of fresh and decomposed hydrophilic (HPL) and hydrophobic (HPB) DOM fractions extracted from the shoots and roots of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), and dairy and poultry manures. Sorption was positively related to apparent molecular weight (MWAP), aromaticity as measured by absorptivity at 280 nm, and phenolic acid content. A 10-d laboratory microbial decomposition of the source organic matter generally increased the sorption of the extracted DOM onto goethite. The decomposition effect on sorption was greater for the <span class="gene">HPL</span> fractions than for the HPB fractions. There was a decrease in the MWAP values of the DOM samples following sorption to goethite. In many cases the reduction in MWAP was large, indicating a strong preference by goethite for the higher MWAP DOM fractions. The results of this laboratory-based research demonstrate that microbial processes affect the chemical characteristics of DOM which may affect the distribution of soil organic C pools.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The F-box protein gene <span class="gene">COI1</span> from Arabidopsis plays a fundamental role in response to jasmonates, which regulate plant root growth, pollen <span class="trait">fertility,</span> wounding and healing, and defense against pathogens and insects. Null mutations in <span class="gene">COI1</span> were previously found to abolish all the jasmonate responses, and the Arabidopsis coil-1 mutant is male sterile and susceptible to pathogen infection. In this study, we isolated an F-box protein gene from soybean, which shares significant homology with the Arabidopsis <span class="gene">COI1</span> and similarly contains an F-box motif and leucine rich repeats (LRR), here designated <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> (Glycine max L. (Merr.) COI1). To test whether the sequence homology and structural similarity are indicative of functional conservation, we expressed <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> in the Arabidopsis coil-1 mutant. The transgenic coil-1 plants with expression of the <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> gene were found to exhibit normal jasmonate responses, including jasmonate-regulated plant defense and <span class="trait">fertility.</span> In addition, the chimerical proteins with swapped domain of the F-box motif or LRR between <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> and <span class="gene">COI1</span> were shown to functionally complement the coil-1 mutation. Furthermore, <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> was found to assemble into the Skpl-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complexes, similar to the formation of the Arabidopsis SCF(COO1). These data demonstrate the soybean F-box protein gene <span class="gene">GmCOI1</span> is able to mediate jasmonate-regulated plant defense and <span class="trait">fertility</span> in Arabidopsis, which implies a generic jasmonate pathway with conserved signal components in different plant species.

						The cassava plant, Manihot esculenta, grows exceptionally well in low <span class="trait">fertility</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> prone environments, but the mechanisms that allow this growth are unknown. Earlier, and sometimes contradictory, work speculated about the presence of a C4-type photosynthesis in cassava leaves. In the present work we found no evidence for a <span class="gene">C4</span> metabolism in mature attached cassava leaves as indicated i) by the low, 2 to 8%, incorporation of (14)CO2 into <span class="gene">C4</span> organic acids in short time periods, 10 s, and the lack of (14)C transfer from <span class="gene">C4</span> acids to other compounds in (12)CO2, ii) by the lack of <span class="gene">C4</span> enzyme activity changes during leaf development and the inability to detect <span class="gene">C4</span> acid decarboxylases, and iii) by leaf CO2 compensation values between 49 and 65 μl of CO2 1(-1) and by other infrared gas exchange photosynthetic measurements. It is concluded that the leaf biochemistry of cassava follows the <span class="gene">C3</span> pathway of photosynthesis with no indication of a C3-C4 mechanism.However, cassava leaves exhibit several novel characteristics. Attached leaves have the ability to effectively partition carbon into sucrose with nearly 45% of the label in sucrose in about one min of (14)CO2 photosynthesis, contrasting with 34% in soybean (C3) and 25% in pigweed (C4). Cassava leaves displayed a strong preference for the synthesis of sucrose versus starch. Field grown cassava leaves exhibited high rates of photosynthesis and curvilinear responses to increasing sunlight irradiances with a tendency to saturate only at high irradiances, above 1500 μmol m(-2) s(-1). Morphologically, the cassava leaf has papillose epidermal cells on its lower mesophyll surface that form 'fence-like' arrangements encircling guard cells. It is proposed that the active synthesis of sugars has osmotic functions in the cassava plant and that the papillose epidermal cells function to maintain a healthy leaf water status in various environments.

						A field experiment was conducted at Stoneville, MS, in Sharkey clay soil in 2009 and 2010, and in Beulah fine sandy loam soil in 2008, 2009, and 2010. This research was a part of a larger research project that involved different research components. We focus here only on the seed nutrition quality component; however, the agronomic component, including <span class="trait">yield,</span> was reported [ <xref rid="pone.0129913.ref009" ref-type="bibr"> 9 </xref> ] where a detailed description of field management and growth conditions was provided. Briefly, the sites were prepared each year by disking and bedding in the fall of the previous year. Raised beds spaced 102 cm apart were formed with a bedding hipper. Prior to planting, raised beds were smoothed with a harrow as needed to plant soybean in a 102 cm single-row and 25-cm twin rows on 102-cm centers and to facilitate furrow irrigation. Cultivar Armor GP 533 (Armor Seed Company, Waldenburg, AR), a mid-MG V [ <xref rid="pone.0129913.ref020" ref-type="bibr"> 20 </xref> ] and Pioneer 94M80 (Pioneer Hi-Bred Int., Huntsville, AL), a late MG IV, were used. Each plot was four-rows wide, planted 11 m long, and end-trimmed to 9 m at the V4 growth stage. Single-row plantings were conducted using an Almaco cone plot planter and twin-row plots were planted using a four unit Monosem NG-3 twin-row vacuum planter set on 102 cm centers between planting units and 25 cm between rows within a unit. In the sandy loam soil, planting dates were 16 April in 2008, 18 April in 2009, and 14 April in 2010. On the Sharkey clay site, planting dates were 22 April in 2009 and 12 April in 2010. Weed control in both sites was achieved by applying a pre-plant application of trifluralin [2,6-Dinitro- <italic> N </italic> , <italic> N </italic> -dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)aniline] at 0.7 kg ai ha <sup> &#x02013;1 </sup> followed by two postemergence applications of metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy- 1-methylethyl) acetamide] and glyphosate [2-[(phosphonomethyl)amino]acetic acid] at growth stage <span class="gene">V2</span> to <span class="gene">V3</span> (two to three trifoliate) and at V5 to V6 (five to six trifoliate). For fungal control, pyraclostrobin (carbamic acid, [[[1-(4-cholrophenyl)-H-pyrazol-3-yl]oxy]methyl]phenyl]methoxy-,methyl ester) was applied according to factory label directions at V5 to V6. Plots were furrow-irrigated from R1 (beginning flowering) through R6 (full seed-fill) with approximately 25 mm water applied at 10 day intervals. Seeds at maturity harvest (R8 stage) were collected and processed, and nutrients were determined as described below. All samples (seeds, leaves, and soil) were processed after sampling and harvesting in a similar way in each year and measured with the same instruments under similar conditions to minimize the variability due to instruments and measurement conditions.

						Many herbivorous insects, through the long history of interaction with their hosts, have evolved the ability to protect themselves from a variety of toxic plant secondary compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Schuler1"> [6] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Danielson1"> [9] </xref> &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Berenbaum2"> [11] </xref> . Our current understanding of insect adaptive mechanisms has been mostly derived from extensive biochemical and molecular studies of major detoxifying enzymes, such as cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and catalases (CATs). P450s, catalyzing the oxidation of xenobiotic substances, are the best studied components of insect detoxification systems. The black swallowtail ( <italic> Papilio polyxenes </italic> ), for example, specializes in feeding on furanocoumarin-containing plants due to development of allelochemical-metabolizing capacities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Ivie1"> [12] </xref> . <italic> P. polyxenes </italic> P450s, encoded by <italic> CYP6B </italic> genes, play a paramount role in furanocoumarin tolerance. Induction of <italic> CYP6B </italic> homologs from generalist <italic> Papilio </italic> species is also responsible for the metabolism of furanocoumarins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Schuler1"> [6] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Wen1"> [13] </xref> . Furanocoumarin metabolites via P450s have been characterized in some species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Nitao1"> [14] </xref> . GSTs also mediate <span class="trait">resistance</span> to plant allelochemicals. As phase II metabolic enzymes, GSTs are capable of conjugating reduced glutathione to the electrophilic centers of a wide variety of substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Li1"> [10] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Lee1"> [15] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Huang1"> [16] </xref> . Further, CATs are key enzymes of the cellular antioxidant defense system, scavenging hydrogen peroxide to avoid oxidative damage to protein, nucleic acid and lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Kim1"> [17] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-DeJong1"> [18] </xref> .

						Deploying secondary metabolites is a common defense mechanism used by many plant species to fight against insect herbivory. Here, we tested dietary bergapten for its effect on a coleopteran storage pest and found that it negatively impacted development, reproduction and survival of cowpea bruchids ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041877-g001"> Fig. 1 </xref> ). Despite the notable plant protective role, many herbivorous insects have evolved various <span class="trait">resistance</span> strategies to evade plant defense, and the front line of battle is the digestive canal. Consistently, our microarray analyses demonstrated that the midgut gene expression program in cowpea bruchids changes in response to dietary challenges, whether the challenge was derived from scN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Chi1"> [32] </xref> or bergapten ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0041877-g002"> Fig. 2 </xref> ). Genome-wide resource reallocation is perhaps an accommodation essential for insect survival. Among bergapten-induced genes are <italic> <span class="gene">P450</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">GST</span> </italic> , <italic> CAT </italic> and <italic> LAC2 </italic> genes ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0041877.s001"> Table S1 </xref> ), known to encode allelochemical-detoxifying enzymes that confer metabolic <span class="trait">resistance,</span> or phenoloxidase that possibly increases <span class="trait">resistance</span> to penetration of bergapten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Li1"> [10] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-DeJong1"> [18] </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0041877-Pan1"> [37] </xref> . Thus it is a logical assumption that transcriptomic reconfiguration contributes to mitigating the toxic effect of plant defensive metabolites.
