						Because <italic> Raso1 </italic> solely showed the aphid <span class="trait">resistance,</span> fine-mapping of <italic> Raso1 </italic> was undertaken. A total of 1245 F <sub> 2 </sub> lines were screened for recombination events between the markers Satt009 and Satt530. Recombination events were confirmed in 93 lines, from which 42 lines were selected. The marker genotype for Satt641 and additional SSR markers located between Satt009 and Satt530 ( <xref rid="t1-bs-61-618" ref-type="table"> Table 1 </xref> ) were determined for the 42 lines. For genotyping, Satt641 and additional SSR markers listed in <xref rid="t1-bs-61-618" ref-type="table"> Table 1 </xref> were used. Fifteen informative lines were selected and the degree of aphid antibiosis was investigated. The results for the seven most-informative lines is presented in <xref rid="f5-bs-61-618" ref-type="fig"> Fig. 5 </xref> . <italic> Raso1 </italic> was located between markers <span class="gene">Gm03-11</span> and <span class="gene">Gm03-12,</span> comprising a 63 kb interval in the Williams 82 genome sequence. This interval contains three predicted genes in the Williams 82 genome sequence, namely <span class="gene">Glyma03g04500</span> (TATA-box binding protein), <span class="gene">Glyma03g04510</span> (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-related) and <span class="gene">Glyma03g04530</span> (NB-ARC domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, a member of the nucleotide-binding site&#x02013;leucine-rich repeat [NBS-LRR] gene family) based on Phytozome v7.0.

						A universal primer (Sprimer: 5'-GGX AAY AAY AGY GGX CAZ CC-3', X = A, G, C or T; Y = T or C; Z = A or G), designed from the consensus sequences that code for the conserved sequence GNNSGQP in the <span class="gene">NIb</span> region of members of the family Potyviridae, was used to amplify by RT-PCR the 3'-terminal genome regions from infected plant samples representing 21 different viruses in the family. Sequencing of some of the fragments (c. 1.7 kb) showed that the type strain (ATTC PV-107) of Oat necrotic mottle <span class="trait">virus</span> is not a distinct species in the genus Rymovirus, but is synonymous with Brome streak mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> (genus Tritimovirus) and that Celery mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> is a distinct member of the genus Potyvirus not closely related to any other sequenced species. Potyviruses infecting crops in China were also investigated, showing that viruses on cowpea and maize in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province were respectively Bean common mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> and Sugarcane mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> and that one on garlic in Nanjing, Jiangsu province was Onion yellow <span class="trait">dwarf</span> <span class="trait">virus.</span> Fragments were also sequenced from Chinese isolates of Lettuce mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> and <span class="trait">Soybean</span> mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> (from Hangzhou), Turnip mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> (2 different isolates from Zhejiang province) and RNA1 of Wheat yellow mosaic <span class="trait">virus</span> (from Rongcheng, Shandong province).

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Maize chlorotic <span class="trait">dwarf</span> <span class="trait">virus</span> (MCDV), a member of the genus Waikavirus, family Secoviridae, has a 11784 nt (+)ssRNA genome that encodes a 389kDa proteolytically processed polyprotein. We show that the N-terminal 78kDa <span class="gene">polyprotein</span> (R78) of MCDV acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing in a well-established assay system. We further demonstrate that R78 is cleaved by the viral 3C-like protease into 51 and 27kDa proteins (p51 and p27), and that p51 is responsible for silencing suppressor activity. Silencing suppressor activity of R78 is conserved in three divergent MCDV strains (MCDV-Severe, MCDV-M1, and MCDV-Tennessee), as well as the waikavirus Bellflower vein <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> <span class="trait">virus,</span> but was not detected for orthologous protein of Rice tungro spherical <span class="trait">virus</span> (RTSV-A) or the similarly-positioned protein from the sequivirus Parsnip yellow fleck <span class="trait">virus</span> (PYFV). This is the first identification of a <span class="trait">virus</span> suppressor of RNA silencing encoded by a waikavirus.
