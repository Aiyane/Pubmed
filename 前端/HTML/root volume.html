				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We previously identified a soybean root-specific WNK homolog, <span class="gene">GmWNK1,</span> which is important for normal late <span class="trait">root</span> development by fine-tuning regulation of ABA levels.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						These findings suggest that, in addition to regulating <span class="trait">root</span> development, <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> also regulates ABA-responsive gene expression and/or interacts with other stress related signals, thereby modulating osmotic stress responses.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> expression was detected in the <span class="trait">root,</span> specifically in <span class="trait">root</span> cells associated with lateral <span class="trait">root</span> formation, and was down-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), as well as by mannitol, sucrose, polyethylene glycol and NaCl.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, 35S-GmWNK1 transgenic soybean plants had reduced lateral <span class="trait">root</span> number and length compared with wild-type, suggesting a role of <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> in the regulation of <span class="trait">root</span> system architecture.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We propose that <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> functions to fine-tune ABA-dependent ABA homeostasis, thereby mediating the regulation of the <span class="trait">root</span> system architecture by ABA and osmotic signals.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The study has revealed a new function of a plant <span class="gene">WNK1</span> gene from the important staple crop soybean, and has identified a new component of a regulatory pathway that is involved not only in ABA signaling, but also in the repression of lateral <span class="trait">root</span> formation by an ABA-dependent mechanism distinct from known ABA signaling pathways.
					</p>
