						KEY MESSAGE: This study provides a foundation for further research on <span class="trait">root</span> genetic regulation and molecular breeding with emphasis on correlations among <span class="trait">root</span> traits to ensure robust <span class="trait">root</span> growth and well-developed <span class="trait">root</span> systems. A set of 447 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Jingdou23 (cultivar, female parent) and ZDD2315 (semi-wild, male parent) were used to analyze inheritance and detect QTLs related to <span class="trait">root</span> traits at the seedling stage using major gene plus polygene mixed inheritance analysis and composite interval mapping. The results showed that maximum <span class="trait">root</span> length (MRL) was controlled by three equivalent major genes, lateral <span class="trait">root</span> number (LRN) was controlled by two overlapping major genes, <span class="trait">root</span> weight (RW) and <span class="trait">volume</span> (RV) were controlled by four equivalent major genes. Hypocotyl length (HL) was controlled by four additive main genes, and hypocotyl weight (HW) was controlled by four additive and additive × additive epistatic, major genes; however, polygene effects were not detected in these traits. Shoot weight (SW) was controlled by multi-gene effects, but major gene effects were not detected. Twenty-four QTLs for MRL, LRN, RW, RV, SW, HL, HW were mapped on LG A1 (chromosome 5), LG A2 (chromosome 8), LG B1 (chromosome 11), LG B2 (chromosome 14), LG <span class="gene">C2</span> (chromosome 6), LG D1b (chromosome 2), LG F_1 (chromosome 13), LG G (chromosome 18), LG H_1 (chromosome 12), LG H_2 (chromosome 12), LG I (chromosome 20), LG K_2 (chromosome 9), LG L (chromosome 19), LG M (chromosome 7), LG N (chromosome 3), LG O (chromosome 10), separately. <span class="trait">Root</span> traits were shown to have complex genetic mechanisms at the seedling stage, SW was controlled by multi-gene effects, and the other six traits were controlled by major gene effects. It is concluded that correlations among <span class="trait">root</span> traits must be considered to improve the development of beneficial <span class="trait">root</span> traits.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We evaluated response differences of normal and transformed (so-called 'hairy') roots of soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr.), cv L17) to the Nod-factor inducing isoflavone genistein and salinity by quantifying growth, nodulation, nitrogen fixation and biochemical changes. Composite soybean plants were generated using Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of non-nodulating mutant nod139 <span class="gene">(GmNFR5α</span> minus) with complementing A. rhizogenes K599 carrying the wild-type <span class="gene">GmNFR5α</span> gene under control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. We used genetic complementation for nodulation ability as only nodulated roots were scored. After hairy <span class="trait">root</span> emergence, primary roots were removed and composite plants were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum (strain CB1809) pre-induced with 10 μM genistein and watered with NaCl (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM). There were significant differences between hairy roots and natural roots in their responses to salt stress and genistein application. In addition, there were noticeable nodulation and nitrogen fixation differences. Composite plants had better growth, more <span class="trait">root</span> <span class="trait">volume</span> and chlorophyll as well as more nodules and higher nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) compared with natural roots. Decreased lipid peroxidation, proline accumulation and catalase/peroxidase activities were found in 'hairy' roots under salinity stress. Genistein significantly increased nodulation and nitrogen fixation and improved roots and shoot growth. Although genistein alleviated lipid peroxidation under salinity stress, it had no significant effect on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In general, composite plants were more competitive in growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation than normal non-transgenic even under salinity stress conditions.

						The WNK (With No Lysine K) serine-threonine kinases have been shown to be osmosensitive regulators and are critical for cell <span class="trait">volume</span> homeostasis in humans. We previously identified a soybean root-specific WNK homolog, <span class="gene">GmWNK1,</span> which is important for normal late <span class="trait">root</span> development by fine-tuning regulation of ABA levels. However, the functions of WNKs in plant osmotic stress response remains uncertain. In this study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmWNK1.</span> We found that these transgenic plants had increased endogenous ABA levels and altered expression of ABA-responsive genes, and exhibited a significantly enhanced tolerance to NaCl and osmotic stresses during seed germination and seedling development. These findings suggest that, in addition to regulating <span class="trait">root</span> development, <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> also regulates ABA-responsive gene expression and/or interacts with other stress related signals, thereby modulating osmotic stress responses. Thus, these results suggest that WNKs are members of an evolutionarily conserved kinase family that modulates cellular response to osmotic stresses in both animal and plants.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In humans, members of the WNK protein kinase family are osmosensitive regulators of cell <span class="trait">volume</span> homeostasis and epithelial ion transport, and mutation of these proteins causes a rare inherited form of hypertension due to increased renal NaCl re-absorption. A related class of kinases was recently discovered in plants, but their functions are largely unknown. We have identified a root-specific WNK kinase homolog, <span class="gene">GmWNK1,</span> in soybean (Glycine max). <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> expression was detected in the <span class="trait">root,</span> specifically in <span class="trait">root</span> cells associated with lateral <span class="trait">root</span> formation, and was down-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), as well as by mannitol, sucrose, polyethylene glycol and NaCl. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> interacts with another soybean protein, <span class="gene">GmCYP707A1,</span> which is a key ABA 8'-hydroxylase that functions in ABA catabolism. Furthermore, 35S-GmWNK1 transgenic soybean plants had reduced lateral <span class="trait">root</span> number and length compared with wild-type, suggesting a role of <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> in the regulation of <span class="trait">root</span> system architecture. We propose that <span class="gene">GmWNK1</span> functions to fine-tune ABA-dependent ABA homeostasis, thereby mediating the regulation of the <span class="trait">root</span> system architecture by ABA and osmotic signals. The study has revealed a new function of a plant <span class="gene">WNK1</span> gene from the important staple crop soybean, and has identified a new component of a regulatory pathway that is involved not only in ABA signaling, but also in the repression of lateral <span class="trait">root</span> formation by an ABA-dependent mechanism distinct from known ABA signaling pathways.

						BACKGROUND AND AIMS The inner cortical cells (IC-cells) of legume <span class="trait">root</span> nodules have been previously shown to regulate the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to nodule O2 diffusion by a rapid contraction/expansion mechanism, which controls the <span class="trait">volume</span> of intercellular spaces and their occlusion by a liquid phase. The expression of aquaporins in IC-cells was also found to be involved in this nodule O2 diffusion mechanism. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) aquaporin isoforms with tonoplast intrinsic protein (gamma-TIP) in both IC-cells and adjacent cell types.METHODS: Using immunogold labelling in ultra-thin sections of Glycine max nodules, the expression of two <span class="gene">PIP</span> isoforms was observed and compared with the gamma-TIP pattern. KEY RESULTS: The plasma membrane aquaporins PIP1 and <span class="gene">PIP2</span> were expressed more in IC-cells and endodermis than in pericycle and infected cells. The tonoplast aquaporin gamma-TIP has shown a distribution pattern similar to that of the PIPs. CONCLUSIONS: PIPs and gamma-TIP aquaporins are highly expressed in both plasmalemma and tonoplast of nodule IC-cells. This distribution is consistent with the putative role of water fluxes associated with the regulation of nodule conductance to O2 diffusion and the subsequent ATP-dependent nitrogenase activity. In the endodermis, these aquaporins might also be involved in nutrient transport between the infected zone and vascular traces.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The crystal structure of the core region of the <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunit (alpha(c')) of soybean beta-conglycinin has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. alpha(c') was superimposed on the known crystal structure of the beta-conglycinin beta subunit with a small root-mean square deviation of 0.77 A, which is consistent with the high sequence identity of 75.5% between alpha(c') and the beta subunit. It is known that the thermal stability of the beta subunit is higher than that of the <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunit and that their thermal stabilities are conferred by highly homologous core regions. Comparisons of the three-dimensional structures and primary sequences between alpha(c') and the beta subunit suggest that five factors account for this difference between subunits as regards the difference in thermal stability: (i) the total cavity <span class="trait">volume</span> is larger in alpha(c'), (ii) the cluster of charged residues at the intermonomer interface is smaller in alpha(c') and alpha(c') lacks the intermonomer salt bridge of the beta subunit, (iii) the solvent-accessible surface is more hydrophobic in alpha(c'), (iv) there are fewer proline residues in alpha(c') and (v) a loop region between helix 3 and strand J' in alpha(c') is more flexible owing to the insertion of five additional residues. Although more hydrogen bonds were found in alpha(c'), this difference should be more than compensated for by the combined contributions of these other factors.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) seedlings osmoregulate when the supply of water is limited around the roots. The osmoregulation involves solute accumulation (osmotic adjustment) by the elongating region of the hypocotyls. We investigated the relationship between growth, solute accumulation, and the partitioning of solutes during osmoregulation. Darkgrown seedlings were transplanted to vermiculite containing 1/8 (0.13 x) the water of the controls. Within 12-15 h, the osmotic potential of the elongating region had decreased to-12 bar, but it was-7 <span class="gene">bar</span> in the controls. This osmoregulation involved a true solute accumulation by the hypocotyls, since cell <span class="trait">volume</span> and turgor were virtually the same regardless of the water regime. The hypocotyls having low water potentials elongated slowly but, when deprived of their cotyledons, did not elongate or accumulate solute. This result indicated a cotyledonary origin for the solutes and a dependence of slow growth on osmotic adjustment. The translocation of nonrespired dry matter from the cotyledons to the seedling axis was unaffected by the availability of water, but partitioning was altered. In the first 12 h, dry matter accumulated in the elongating region of the 0.13 x hypocotyls, and osmotic adjustment occurred. The solutes involved were mostly free amino acids, glucose, fructose, and sucrose, and these accounted for most of the increased dry weight. After osmotic adjustment was complete, dry matter ceased to accumulate in the hypocotyls and bypassed them to accumulate in the roots, which grew faster than the control roots. The proliferation of the roots resulted in an increased root/shoot ratio, a common response of plants to dry conditions.Osmotic adjustment occurred in the elongating region of the hypocotyls because solute utilization for growth decreased while solute uptake continued. Adjustment was completed when solute uptake subsequently decreased, and uptake then balanced utilization. The control of osmotic adjustment was therefore the rate of solute utilization and, secondarily, the rate of solute uptake. Elongation was inhibited by unknown factors(s) despite the turgor and substrates associated with osmotic adjustment. The remaining slow elongation depended on osmotic adjustment and represented some optimum between the necessary inhibition for solute accumulation and the necessary growth for seedling establishment.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						An analytical technique which allows the experimental determination of soybean (Glycine max L.) <span class="trait">root</span> properties is presented. Two major problems hamper the interpretation of experimental data. These are: (a) the influence of a possible boundary layer which raises the effective value of <span class="gene">pi</span> degrees above that of the bulk solution; and (b) the difficulty of obtaining an adequate measure of the internal osmotic pressure except at high values of <span class="trait">volume</span> flow rate due primarily to possible exchanges of solutes between the xylem and adjacent tissues. Consideration of these two problems leads to an interpretation of previous models which is reconcilable with the criticisms of Newman (Plant Physiology 1975 57: 738-739).In these experiments, estimates of hydraulic conductivity and reflection coefficient are based on high flow rate data where the osmotic effects are minimized. Because of the difficulties attached to the evaluation of pi(i), at low and moderate flow rates, any technique for evaluating <span class="trait">root</span> parameters which depends on knowledge of when the osmotic pressure difference (in bars) is zero will be subject to large errors, at least until both problems metioned above have been adequately resolved.An additional problem which must be dealt with in terminal <span class="trait">root</span> segments is the effect of a standing osmotic gradient. It is thought that this is not a serious problem in a complex <span class="trait">root</span> system.Transpiration rates are calculated on the basis of leaf and <span class="trait">root</span> surface areas and experimentally determined <span class="trait">root</span> <span class="trait">volume</span> flow. It is shown that <span class="trait">root</span> flow rates necessary to sustain high transpiration rates in the shoots are easily accommodated by the model at moderate levels of applied pressure difference.

						Most common carboxylates in <span class="trait">root</span> exudates (citrate, malate, malonate, acetate, fumarate, succinate, lactate and oxalate) [ <xref rid="B11-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 11 </xref> ] are involved in respiration, stomatal regulation and other metabolic pathways, hence their efflux is primarily influenced by activity of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid pathways [ <xref rid="B5-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 5 </xref> ]. Rate of exudation is a function of higher concentration of carboxylic acids in the cytosol as well as the expression and activation of efflux transporters/anion channels in the plasma membrane of <span class="trait">root</span> cells [ <xref rid="B12-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 12 </xref> ]. Members of the aluminum-activated malate transporter (ALMT) and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) membrane protein families mediate malate and citrate efflux, respectively [ <xref rid="B13-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 13 </xref> ]. Earlier reports on efflux transporters in wheat ( <italic> Triticum aestivum </italic> ) TaALMT1 [ <xref rid="B14-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 14 </xref> ] and TaMATE1 [ <xref rid="B15-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 15 </xref> ] suggested that their expression was induced by aluminum toxicity. Overexpression of <italic> TaALMT1 </italic> in barley improved P acquisition on acidic soils [ <xref rid="B16-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 16 </xref> ] confirming that P deficiency also induced expression of transporter proteins to facilitate carboxylate exudation. Liang and co-workers [ <xref rid="B17-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 17 </xref> ] isolated and characterized a malate efflux transporter from soybean <italic> <span class="gene">GmALMT1</span> </italic> , which was regulated by low pH, aluminum and P supply. In soybean, efflux transporters for malate <span class="gene">(GmALMT1)</span> and citrate <span class="gene">(GmMATE)</span> have been identified till date. Search for the missing players (genes/proteins) regulating synthesis and efflux of other carboxylic acids may enhance our knowledge in improving P uptake efficiency of soybean and related crops.

						Total RNA was isolated from <span class="trait">root</span> tissue with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified in Nanodrop1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Contamination by genomic DNA was removed by treating 10 &#x003bc;g of RNA with DNase I (Promega). RNA integrity was verified in 1% ( <italic> w </italic> / <italic> v </italic> ) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light in a gel documentation system (AlphaImager, Cell Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. All samples were normalized to contain 50 ng&#x000b7;&#x003bc;L <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> of cDNA confirmed by the amplification of the reference gene &#x0201c;elongation factor 1&#x003b1;&#x0201d; ( <italic> <span class="gene">Gm_EF1</span> </italic> &#x003b1;) and visualized on a 3% ( <italic> w </italic> / <italic> v </italic> ) agarose gel. Gene-specific primers ( <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-08-00341"> Table S1 </xref> A,B) of proteins with significant Mascot scores were designed using the RealTime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tool of Integrated DNA Technologies [ <xref rid="B33-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 33 </xref> ]. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was carried out using the DyNAmoColorFlash SYBR Green I qPCR kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a Stratagene Mx3005P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Reverse transcription-qPCR was performed in triplicate of 20 &#x003bc;L reaction containing 10 &#x003bc;L of 2X SYBR Green I master mix, 0.12 &#x003bc;L of 50X ROX passive reference dye, 1 &#x003bc;L of forward primer (0.5 pmol &#x003bc;L <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ), 1 &#x003bc;L of reverse primer (0.5 pmol &#x003bc;L <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ), 1 &#x003bc;L of cDNA template and 6.88 &#x003bc;L of nuclease-free water. The cycling parameters were as follows: 10 min of pre-denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 &#x000b0;C and 30 s at 60 &#x000b0;C, followed by dissociation curve analysis (1 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, 30 s at 55 &#x000b0;C and ramp up to 95 &#x000b0;C). The MxPro software version 4.10 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for data collection. Melt curves were examined to detect inadvertent multiple amplicons. Primer specificity was also ensured by presence of single PCR product visualized on a 3% ( <italic> w </italic> / <italic> v </italic> ) agarose gel. The comparative cycle threshold method [ <xref rid="B34-genes-08-00341" ref-type="bibr"> 34 </xref> ] was used to calculate relative transcript levels at experimental condition (low P) with three reference genes: 60S ribosomal subunit ( <italic> <span class="gene">Gm_60S</span> </italic> ), F-box ( <italic> <span class="gene">Gm_F-box</span> </italic> ) and <italic> <span class="gene">GmEF1</span> </italic> &#x003b1;.
