				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Chilling</span> tolerance is an important trait of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] produced in cool climates. We previously isolated a soybean flavonoid 3' hydroxylase (F3'H) gene corresponding to the T locus, which controls pubescence and seed coat color. A genetic link between the T gene and <span class="trait">chilling</span> tolerance has been reported, although the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using the soybean near-isogenic lines (NILs) To7B (TT) and To7G (tt), we examined the relationship between <span class="trait">chilling</span> <span class="trait">injury,</span> antioxidant activity and flavonoid profiles associated with <span class="trait">chilling</span> treatment (15°C). <span class="trait">Chilling</span> <span class="trait">injury</span> was more severe in the second trifoliate leaves of To7G than in those of To7B. Hydrogen peroxide accumulation and lipid peroxidation were enhanced by <span class="trait">chilling</span> in To7G. Chilling-induced enhancement of antioxidant activity was more prominent in To7B than in To7G. High performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the contents of quercetin glycosides and isorhamnetin glycosides (3',4'-dihydroxylated flavonol derivatives) increase in the second trifoliate leaves of To7B after <span class="trait">chilling</span> treatment, whereas the same treatment increased kaempferol glycoside (4'-monohydroxylated flavonol derivatives) content in the corresponding leaves of To7G. Histochemical staining also demonstrated chilling-induced flavonoid accumulation. Microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the transcript levels of soybean <span class="gene">F3'H</span> are upregulated by <span class="trait">chilling.</span> The differences in <span class="trait">chilling</span> <span class="trait">injury,</span> antioxidant activity and flavonoid species between the two NILs support the notion that soybean <span class="gene">F3'H</span> affects <span class="trait">chilling</span> tolerance by increasing antioxidant activity via production of 3',4'-dihydroxylated flavonol derivatives.
