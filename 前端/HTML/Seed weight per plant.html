						A set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from soybean vars. Kefeng No.1 x Nannong 1138-2 was used to construct a genetic linkage map. The two parents exhibit contrasting characteristics for most of the traits that were mapped. Using restricted fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we mapped 452 markers onto 21 linkage groups and covered 3595.9 cM of the soybean genome. All of the linkage groups except linkage group F were consistent with those of the consensus map of Cregan et al. (1999). Linkage group F was divided into two linkage groups, F1 and F2. The map consisted of 189 RFLPs, 219 SSRs, 40 ESTs, three R gene loci and one phenotype marker. Ten agronomic traits-days to flowering, days to maturity, <span class="trait">plant</span> height, number of nodes on main stem, <span class="trait">lodging,</span> number of pods <span class="trait">per</span> node, protein content, oil content, 100-seed <span class="trait">weight,</span> and plot yield-were studied. Using winqtlcart, we detected 63 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had LOD&gt;3 for nine of the agronomic traits (only exception being <span class="trait">seed</span> oil content) and mapped these on 12 linkage groups. Most of the QTLs were clustered, especially on groups B1 and C2. Some QTLs were mapped to the same loci. This pleiotropism was common for most of the QTLs, and one QTL could influence at most five traits. Seven EST markers were found to be linked closely with or located at the same loci as the QTLs. EST marker <span class="gene">GmKF059a,</span> encoding a repressor protein and mapped on group C2, accounted for about 20% of the total variation of days to flowering, <span class="trait">plant</span> height, <span class="trait">lodging</span> and nodes on the main stem, respectively.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] <span class="trait">seed</span> oil is the primary global source of edible oil and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean is desirable; however, that goal is complex due to the quantitative nature of the oil concentration trait and possible effects on major agronomic traits such as <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> or protein concentration. The objectives of the present study were to study the relationship between <span class="trait">seed</span> oil concentration and important agronomic and <span class="trait">seed</span> quality traits, including <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> 100-seed <span class="trait">weight,</span> protein concentration, <span class="trait">plant</span> height, and days to maturity, and to identify oil quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are co-localized with the traits evaluated. A population of 203 F4:6 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between moderately high oil soybean genotypes OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe, was developed and grown across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. Among the 11 QTL associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> oil concentration in the population, which were detected using either single-factor ANOVA or multiple QTL mapping methods, the number of QTL that were co-localized with other important traits QTL were six for protein concentration, four for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> two for 100-seed <span class="trait">weight,</span> one for days to maturity, and one for <span class="trait">plant</span> height. The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> protein concentration. The oil favorable alleles of markers Satt001 and <span class="gene">GmDGAT2B</span> were positively correlated with <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span> In addition, significant two-way epistatic interactions, where one of the interacting markers was solely associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> oil concentration, were identified for the selected traits in this study. The number of significant epistatic interactions was seven for <span class="trait">yield,</span> four for days to maturity, two for 100-seed <span class="trait">weight,</span> one for protein concentration, and one for <span class="trait">plant</span> height. The identified molecular markers associated with oil-related QTL in this study, which also have positive effects on other important traits such as <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> and protein concentration, could be used in the soybean marker breeding programs aimed at developing either higher <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> and oil concentration or higher <span class="trait">seed</span> protein and oil concentration <span class="trait">per</span> hectare. Alternatively, selecting complementary parents with greater breeding values due to positive epistatic interactions could lead to the development of higher oil soybean cultivars.
