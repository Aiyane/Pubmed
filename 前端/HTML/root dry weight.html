						KEY MESSAGE: <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> , a novel plant <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene in soybean, has phytase activity. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> can enhance Arabidopsis growth when phytate is the sole P source in culture. Phosphorus (P) is an important macronutrient for plant growth and development. However, most of the total P in soils is fixed into organic phosphate (Po). Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) can hydrolyze Po in the soil to liberate inorganic phosphate and enhance plant P utilization. We isolated a novel <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene, <span class="gene">GmPAP4,</span> from soybean (Glycine max). It had an open reading frame of 1,329 bp, encoding 442 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment and phylogenetics analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was similar to other plant PAPs with large molecular masses. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the induced expression of <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> was greater in P-efficient genotype Zhonghuang15 (ZH15) than in P-inefficient genotype Niumaohuang (NMH) during the periods of flowering (28-35 days post phytate stress; DPP) and pod formation (49-63 DPP). Moreover, peak expression, at 63 DPP, was about 3-fold higher in 'ZH15' than in 'NMH'. Sub-cellular localization showed that <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> might be on plasma membrane or in cytoplasm. Over-expressing <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> in Arabidopsis resulted in significant rises in P acquisition and utilization compared with the wild-type (WT). Under phytate condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed increases of approximately 132.7 % in <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and 162.6 % in shoot P content compared with the WT. Furthermore, when phytate was added as the sole P source in cultures, the activity of acid phosphatase was significantly higher in transgenic plants. Therefore, <span class="gene">GmPAP4</span> is a novel <span class="gene">PAP</span> gene that functions in plant's utilization of organic phosphate especially under phytate condition.

						We investigated how <span class="trait">root</span> hydraulic conductance (normalized to <span class="trait">root</span> <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight,</span> Lo ) is regulated by the shoot. Shoot topping (about 30% reduction in leaf area) reduced Lo of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) by 50 to 60%. More detailed investigations with soybean and grapevine showed that the reduction in Lo was not correlated with the reduction in leaf area, and shading or cutting single leaves had a similar effect. Percentage reduction in Lo was largest when initial Lo was high in soybean. Inhibition of Lo by weak acid (low pH) was smaller after shoot damage or leaf shading. The half time of reduction in Lo was approximately 5 min after total shoot decapitation. These characteristics indicate involvement of aquaporins. We excluded phloem-borne signals and auxin-mediated signals. Xylem-mediated hydraulic signals are possible since turgor rapidly decreased within <span class="trait">root</span> cortex cells after shoot topping. There was a significant reduction in the expression of several aquaporins in the plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) family of both grapevine and soybean. In soybean, there was a five- to 10-fold reduction in <span class="gene">GmPIP1;6</span> expression over 0.5-1 h which was sustained over the period of reduced Lo .

						Phosphate (Pi) remobilization within a plant is critical for plant survival under Pi-limiting conditions. In this paper, a soybean Pi transporter gene, <span class="gene">GmPT1,</span> was characterized. A marked induction of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> transcript was observed in young leaves, mature leaves and lateral roots during long-term Pi starvation. Transgenic tobacco plants containing the <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> gene were obtained using an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants showed significant increases in phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE), photosystem II (PSII) function, total <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and seed <span class="trait">weight</span> under Pi-deficient conditions. <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels and PUE were determined in a soybean recombinant inbred line population during a pot experiment that was conducted to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic rate (PN ) and seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> Correlation analysis revealed that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels had significantly positive correlations with seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> PUE, PN and the quantum <span class="trait">yield</span> of PSII primary photochemistry (ΦPSII ). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping for <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> revealed two eQTLs, one of which coincided with both the physical location of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> and a QTL associated with seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> plays a role in Pi remobilization, and it may be possible to improve soybean seed yields under Pi-limiting conditions by modulating <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the present study, we investigated the effects of dopamine, an allelochemical exuded from the velvetbean (Mucuna pruriens L DC. var utilis), on the growth and cell viability of soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) roots. We analyzed the effects of dopamine on superoxide dismutase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and cell wall-bound peroxidase activities as well as its effects on lignin contents in the roots. Three-day-old seedlings were cultivated in half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (pH 6.0), without or with 0.25 to 1.0 mM dopamine, in a growth chamber (25°C, 12L:12D photoperiod, irradiance of 280 μmol m(-2) s(-1)) for 24 h. In general, the length, fresh <span class="trait">weight</span> and <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> of roots, cell viability, <span class="gene">PAL</span> and POD activities decreased, while SOD activities increased after dopamine treatment. The content of lignin was not altered. The data demonstrate the susceptibility of soybean to dopamine and reinforce the role of this catecholamine as a strong allelochemical. The results also suggest that dopamine-induced inhibition in soybean roots is not related to the production of lignin, but may be related to damage caused by reactive oxygen species.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is an important oil crop in agricultural production, but low phosphorus (P) availability limits soybean growth and production. Expansin is a family of plant cell wall proteins and involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cell division and enlargement, <span class="trait">root</span> growth and leaf development. To test the potential effects of expansins on crop production, we have developed soybean transgenic plants overexpressing a soybean β-expansin gene <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> which was significantly induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation. The results indicated that constitutive overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> promoted leaf expansion, sequentially stimulated <span class="trait">root</span> growth and consequently resulted in improved P efficiency in the transgenic plants under P-limited conditions in hydroponics. In particular, when tested in calcareous (CS) and acid soils (AS), the two <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> transgenic soybean lines showed above 25 and 40% increases in plant <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and P content, respectively to wild-type plants in low-P CS, but not in AS. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which improvement of P efficiency could be achieved through constitutive overexpression of an endogenous EXPB gene in soybean. These findings suggest that genetic modification of <span class="trait">root</span> and leaf traits might be a suitable strategy for improving crop production in low-P soils.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sunflower broomrape is a noxious parasitic weed which has caused severe damage to crop ecosystems. Trap crops can release a mixture of allelochemicals to induce the germination of sunflower broomrape. We studied the allelopathic effects of soybean on sunflower broomrape. Fourteen common soybean cultivars were grown in pots. Samples were collected from soybean plants and rhizosphere soil at five growth stages (V1, V3, V5, R2, and R4). The allelopathic effects of soybean reached highest at the <span class="gene">V3</span> stage. Methanolic extracts of soybean roots induced higher broomrape germination than methanolic extracts of stems or leaves. The germination rates induced by <span class="trait">root</span> extracts (10-fold dilution) were positively correlated with germination rates induced by stem (10-fold dilution) and leaf extracts (10-fold dilution). The broomrape germination rates induced by <span class="trait">root</span> extracts were also positively correlated with soybean nodule diameter and <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight.</span> The results indicated that soybeans could induce sunflower broomrape germination. We conclude that soybean has the potential to be used as a trap crop for sunflower broomrape.

						Soil for the pot experiment was collected from the surface horizon (0&#x02013;20 cm) of a cultivated field belonging to Guyuan Ecological Station of the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (35&#x000b0; 99&#x02032; N, 106&#x000b0; 44&#x02032; E), near Hechuan Village, Guyuan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China, and no specific permits were required for this field study. The soil, which is classified as a common dark loessial soil, has the following characteristics: pH, 7.41; soil organic matter, 9.41 g kg <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ; total N, 0.28 g kg <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ; available P, 2.28 mg kg <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ; and available K, 206 mg kg <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> . The soil was thoroughly mixed and then 8 kg of <span class="trait">dry</span> soil was placed in 7.8 L plastic pots. Ten seeds of each cultivar were sown per pot. There were 15 pots per cultivar. The soybean population was thinned to five seedlings per pot after emergence. The pots were placed outside in a sunny area and the plants watered daily. Three pots of each cultivar were destructively sampled at the <span class="gene">V1</span> (Completely unrolled leaf at the unifoliolate node), <span class="gene">V3</span> (Three nodes on the main stem beginning with the unifoliolate node), V5 (Five nodes on the main stem beginning with the unifoliolate node), R2 (Flower at node immediately below the uppermost node with a completely unrolled leaf) and R4 (Pod 2 cm long at one of the four uppermost nodes with a completely unrolled leaf) stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059715-Fehr1"> [21] </xref> . On each sample date, the pots were cut open and samples of rhizosphere soil were removed. Samples of the leaves, stems, and roots were collected and prepared for extraction as described below <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0059715-Riley1"> [22] </xref> .

						Methanolic extracts of soybean roots or shoots (i.e., stems or leaves) generally induced significant broomrape germination ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g004"> Fig. 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g005"> 5 </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g006"> 6 </xref> ), whereas aqueous extracts induced germination rates of &#x0003c;10% ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059715.s003"> Table S3 </xref> , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059715.s003"> S4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0059715.s005"> S5 </xref> ). Among methanolic <span class="trait">root</span> extracts, extracts of roots collected at <span class="gene">V3</span> induced the highest broomrape germination rates. The ability of <span class="trait">root</span> extracts to induce germination generally declined as the plants matured beyond V3. At V3, methanolic <span class="trait">root</span> extracts of nine cultivars induced germination rates &#x0003e;60% (Kenjiandou 36, undiluted, 65.2%; Suinong 99, undiluted, 63.3%; Beidou 18, 10-fold dilution, 60.5%; Suinong 10, 10-fold dilution, 63.6%; Zhonghuang 13, 10-fold dilution, 70.1%; Kenjiandou 35, 10-fold dilution, 61.5%; Heinong 44, 10-fold dilution, 61.2%; Nongda 555, 10-fold dilution, 63.9%; and Kenfeng 16, 10-fold dilution, 64.1%). The differences among cultivars were significant ( <italic> P </italic> &#x0003c;0.05).

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						At V3, the 10-fold dilutions of soybean roots extracts stimulated higher germination rates than the 100-fold dilution extracts. The germination rates induced by 10-fold dilutions of <span class="trait">root</span> extracts ranged from 43.4 to 70.1%. In comparison, the 100-fold dilutions of <span class="trait">root</span> extracts induced germination rates between 19.7 and 61.2%. The diameter of the <span class="trait">root</span> nodules ranged from 0.94 to 2.25 cm. The germination rates induced by 10- and 100-fold dilutions of <span class="trait">root</span> extracts increased in the form of power as the diameter of the nodules increased (10-fold dilutions, y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;49.717&#x000d7; <sup> 0.1012 </sup> , R <sup> 2 </sup> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.3237, <italic> P </italic> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.034; 100-fold dilutions, y&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26.528&#x000d7; <sup> 0.3168 </sup> , R <sup> 2 </sup> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.4134, <italic> P </italic> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g008"> Fig. 8A </xref> ). The <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> of nodules at <span class="gene">V3</span> ranged from 1.0 to 10.8 g per plant.

						On the basis of the pot experiments, we selected one cultivar with high allelopathic effect (i.e., Zhonghuang 13) and two cultivars with relatively low allelopathic effects (i.e., Fengdou 3 and Kenfeng 16) for a field experiment. The rhizosphere soils and soybean tissues were only extracted with methanol. Undiluted methanolic extracts of rhizosphere soil collected at <span class="gene">V3</span> induced the highest broomrape germination rates. The differences among cultivars were significant ( <italic> P </italic> &#x0003c;0.05) with Zhonghuang 13 inducing the highest germination rate (40.8%) at V3. The 100-fold dilutions of rhizosphere soil collected at V5 induced higher broomrape germination rates than the 10-fold and undiluted solutions. Zhonghuang 13 induced the highest germination rate (31.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g009"> Fig. 9 </xref> ). Methanolic <span class="trait">root</span> extracts induced germination rates of &#x0003e;30% at all three growth stages. The 100-fold dilution of methanolic <span class="trait">root</span> extracts from Zhonghuang 13 induced the highest germination rate (34.9%) than the other two cultivars, which was consistent with the results of the pot experiment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g004"> Fig. 4 </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g010"> 10 </xref> ). Methanolic stem extracts collected at <span class="gene">V3</span> and V5 induced higher germination rates than methanolic stem extracts collected at R4. Undiluted stem extracts of Kenfeng 16 induced the highest germination rate (45.2%) at V3. However, there was no significant difference among the cultivars ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0059715-g011"> Fig. 11 </xref> ). The germination rates induced by leaf extracts were lower than those induced by stem or <span class="trait">root</span> extracts.

Among the undiluted solutions of leaf extracts at V5, those of Fengdou 3 and Zhonghuang 13 induced significantly higher germination rates than those of Kenfeng 16.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) is formed in glyphosate-treated glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-sensitive (GS) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plants and is known to cause yellowing in soybean. Although, AMPA is less phytotoxic than glyphosate, its mode of action is different from that of glyphosate and is still unknown. Greenhouse studies were conducted at Stoneville, <span class="gene">MS</span> to determine the effects of AMPA on plant growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, nodulation, nitrogenase activity, nitrate reductase activity, and shoot nitrogen content in <span class="gene">GR</span> and <span class="gene">GS</span> soybeans. AMPA was applied to one- to two-trifoliolate leaf stage soybeans at 0.1 and 1.0 kg ha(-1), representing a scenario of 10% and 100% degradation of glyphosate (1.0 kg ae ha(-1) use rate) to AMPA, respectively. Overall, AMPA effects were more pronounced at 1.0 kg ha(-1) than at 0.1 kg ha(-1) rate. Visual plant injury (18-27%) was observed on young leaves within 3d after treatment (DAT) with AMPA at the higher rate regardless of soybean type. AMPA injury peaked to 46-49% at 14 DAT and decreased to 17-18% by 28 DAT, in both soybean types. AMPA reduced the chlorophyll content by 37%, 48%, 66%, and 23% in <span class="gene">GR</span> soybean, and 17%, 48%, 57%, and 22% in <span class="gene">GS</span> soybean at 3, 7, 14, and 28 DAT, respectively. AMPA reduced the photosynthesis rate by 65%, 85%, and 77% in <span class="gene">GR</span> soybean and 59%, 88%, and 69% in <span class="gene">GS</span> soybean at 3, 7, and 14 DAT, respectively, compared to non-treated plants. Similarly, AMPA reduced stomatal conductance to water vapor and transpiration rates at 3, 7, and 14 DAT compared to non-treated plants in both soybean types. Photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate recovered to the levels of non-treated plants by 28 DAT. Plant height and shoot <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> at 28 DAT; nodulation, nitrogenase activity at 10 DAT, and nitrate reductase activity at 3 and 14 DAT were unaffected by AMPA. AMPA reduced <span class="trait">root</span> respiration and shoot nitrogen content at 10 DAT. These results suggest that a foliar application of AMPA could indirectly reduce photosynthesis through decreased chlorophyll content in <span class="gene">GR</span> and <span class="gene">GS</span> soybean up to 14 DAT, but affected plants can recover to normal growth by 28 DAT.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Previous studies on the interaction between environmental inorganic phosphate (Pi) and salinity stress using soybean cultivars sensitive to high external Pi had two limitations: (1) the phenotype was dominated by overaccumulation of phosphorus (P); and (2) no detailed analysis was performed for sodium ion uptake. In this study, we focused on the effects of high external Pi on the sodium ion uptake in 'Pi-tolerant' soybean cultivars. The P accumulation in Pi-tolerant soybean Union was much lower [9.0 mg g(-)(1) <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> (DW); contrasting to 38-76 mg g(-)(1) DW in the 'Pi-sensitive' soybean cultivars]. At in planta level, high level of external Pi significantly (P &lt; 0.001) increased net sodium ion uptake and aggravated salinity stress symptoms. The effects of high external Pi diminished when de-rooted plants were used, suggesting that <span class="trait">root</span> is the primary organ interacting with Pi in the growth medium. Two-cell models, including soybean suspension cells and the tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cell line, were also employed to study the effects of high external Pi at the cellular level. Consistent to in planta results, high external Pi uplifted cellular sodium ion uptake and reduced cell viability under salinity stress. Gene expression analyses further showed that HPi (2 mM Pi supplements; excessive level of Pi) could reduce the fold of induction of <span class="gene">GmSOS1</span> and <span class="gene">GmCNGC</span> under salinity stress, suggesting that they may be possible molecular targets involved in the interaction between high external Pi and Na(+) uptake.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To investigate the genetic mechanism of Al-tolerance in soybean, a recombinant inbred line population (RIL) with 184 F(2:7:11) lines derived from the cross of Kefeng No.1 x Nannong 1138-2 (Al-tolerant x Al-sensitive) were tested in pot experiment with sand culture medium in net room in Nanjing. Four traits, i.e. plant height, number of leaves, shoot <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and <span class="trait">root</span> <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> at seedling stage, were evaluated and used to calculate the average membership index (FAi) as the indicator of Al-tolerance. The composite interval mapping (CIM) under WinQTL Cartographer v. 2.5 detected five QTLs (i.e. qFAi-1, qFAi-2, qFAi-3, qFAi-4 and qFAi-5), explaining 5.20%-9.07% of the total phenotypic variation individually. While with the multiple interval mapping (MIM) of the same software, five QTLs (qFAi-1, qFAi-5, qFAi-6, qFAi-7, and qFAi-8) explaining 5.7%-24.60% of the total phenotypic variation individually were mapped. Here qFAi-1 and qFAi-5 were detected by both CIM and MIM with the locations in a same flanking marker region, <span class="gene">GMKF046-GMKF080</span> on B1 and satt278-sat_95 on L, respectively. While qFAi-2 under CIM and qFAi-6 under MIM both on D1b2 were located in neighboring regions with their confidence intervals overlapped and might be the same locus. Segregation analysis under major gene plus polygene inheritance model showed that Al-tolerance was controlled by two major genes (h(2) (mg) = 33.05%) plus polygenes (h(2) (pg) = 52.73%). Both QTL mapping and segregation analysis confirmed two QTLs responsible for Al-tolerance with relatively low heritability, and there might be a third QTL, confounded with the polygenes in segregation analysis.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L: -DOPA), an allelochemical exuded from the roots of velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. utilis], presents a highly inhibitory action to plant growth. The effects of L-DOPA on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) and peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) activities, and phenolic compound and lignin content in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] roots were investigated to determine the possible phytotoxic mechanism. Three-day-old seedlings were cultivated in half-strength Hoagland nutrient solution (pH 6.0), without or with 0.1 to 1.0 mM L-DOPA in a growth chamber (25 degrees C, 12-hr light to 12-hr darkness photoperiod, irradiance of 280 micromol m-2 s-1) for 24 hr. In general, the length, fresh <span class="trait">weight,</span> and <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> of the roots decreased, whereas <span class="gene">PAL</span> and POD activities and phenolic compound and lignin content increased after L-DOPA treatments. Results showed the susceptibility of soybean to L-DOPA and reinforce the role of this nonprotein amino acid as a strong allelochemical. The present findings also suggest that L-DOPA-induced inhibition in soybean roots may be because of a cell wall stiffening process related to the formation of cross-linking between cell wall polymers linked to lignin production.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effect of composted textile sludge on growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of soybean and cowpea was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. The compost was incorporated into soil at 0, 9.5, 19 and 38 t ha(-1) (bases upon the N requirement of the crops, i.e., 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg available N ha(-1)). Growth, nodulation and shoot accumulation of nitrogen were evaluated 36 and 63 days after plant emergence. Nodule glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and leghemoglobin content were evaluated 63 days after emergence. Composted textile sludge did not show negative effects on nodule number and <span class="trait">weight,</span> nodule <span class="gene">GS</span> activity and leghemoglobin content. Nitrogen accumulation in shoot <span class="trait">dry</span> matter in soybean and cowpea was higher than other treatments with application of 19 t ha(-1) of compost. Composting can be an alternate technology for the management of solid textile mill sludge. This study verifies that the composted textile sludge was not harmful to growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of soybean and cowpea.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Expression of Bradyrhizobium japonicum wild-type strain USDA110 nirK, <span class="gene">norC</span> and <span class="gene">nosZ</span> denitrification genes in soybean <span class="trait">root</span> nodules was studied by in situ histochemical detection of beta-galactosidase activity. Similarly, P(nirK)-lacZ, P(norC)-lacZ, and P(nosZ)-lacZ fusions were also expressed in bacteroids isolated from <span class="trait">root</span> nodules. Levels of beta-galactosidase activity were similar in both bacteroids and nodule sections from plants that were solely N(2)-dependent or grown in the presence of 4 mM KNO(3). These findings suggest that oxygen, and not nitrate, is the main factor controlling expression of denitrification genes in soybean nodules. In plants not amended with nitrate, B. japonicum mutant strains GRK308, GRC131, and GRZ25, that were altered in the structural nirK, <span class="gene">norC</span> and <span class="gene">nosZ</span> genes, respectively, showed a wild-type phenotype with regard to nodule number and nodule <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> as well as plant <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and nitrogen content. In the presence of 4 mM KNO(3), plants inoculated with either GRK308 or GRC131 showed less nodules, and lower plant <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and nitrogen content, relative to those of strains USDA110 and GRZ25. Taken together, the present results revealed that although not essential for nitrogen fixation, mutation of either the structural <span class="gene">nirK</span> or <span class="gene">norC</span> genes encoding respiratory nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase, respectively, confers B. japonicum reduced ability for nodulation in soybean plants grown with nitrate. Furthermore, because nodules formed by each the parental and mutant strains exhibited nitrogenase activity, it is possible that denitrification enzymes play a role in nodule formation rather than in nodule function.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A trial was conducted to investigate energy and nutrient digestibility of cassava leaf meal (CLM), casein (CAS), fish meal (FM), full-fat soya bean (FFSB) and extracted soya bean meal (SBM). The basal diet containing cassava <span class="trait">root</span> meal (CRM) and FFSB meal and the other five dietary treatments were evaluated with 12 crossbred castrated male pigs in a metabolism study covering three successive experimental periods between 40 and 60 kg body <span class="trait">weight</span> (BW). Total tract digestibility of <span class="trait">dry</span> matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and gross energy (GE) of diets, generally increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from CLM diet to FFSB and FM diets and finally to <span class="gene">CAS</span> and SBM diets, corresponding to a decrease in fibre content in the diets. Except for <span class="gene">CAS</span> diets, the pattern of acid detergent fibre (ADF) digestibility followed a similar trend. Significantly higher ADF digestibility was recorded for soya bean diets while ADF digestibility value obtained for CLM diet was significantly lower. The digestible energy values obtained for CAS, FM, FFSB, SBM and CLM were 22.2, 16.3, 17.5, 17.0 and 8.0 MJ/kg DM, respectively. Corresponding metabolizable energy values were 22.1, 15.6, 17.1, 16.3 and 7.6 MJ/kg DM, respectively,

						The influence of the allelochemicals ferulic (FA) and vanillic (VA) acids on peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5) activities and their relationships with phenolic acid (PhAs) contents and <span class="trait">root</span> growth of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) were examined. Three-day-old seedlings were cultivated in nutrient solution containing FA or VA (0.1 to 1 mM) for 48 h. Both compounds (at 0.5 and 1 mM) decreased <span class="trait">root</span> length (RL), fresh <span class="trait">weight</span> (FW) and <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> (DW) and increased PhAs contents. At 0.5 and 1 mM, FA increased soluble POD activity (18% and 47%, respectively) and cell wall (CW)-bound POD activity (61% and 34%), while VA increased soluble POD activity (33% and 17%) but did not affect CW-bound POD activity. At 1 mM, FA increased (82%) while VA reduced (32%) <span class="gene">PAL</span> activities. The results are discussed on the basis of the role of these compounds on phenylpropanoid metabolism and <span class="trait">root</span> growth and suggest that the effects caused on POD and <span class="gene">PAL</span> activities are some of the many mechanisms by which allelochemicals influence plant growth.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A recombinant plasmid pHN307 containing C4-dicarboxylic acid transport genes (dctABD) from Sinorhizobium meliloti, <span class="gene">nifA</span> genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae and reporter genes luxAB from pDB30 was constructed by using pTR102 as the vector. The pHN307 was then introduced into the S. fredii HN01, YC4 and GR3 by tri-parental mating, and the stability of pHN307 in the transconjugants under free-living and symbiotic condition was also investigated. The results of plant pot experiment indicated that the introduction of pHN307 in the transconjugants could significantly increase the nodule fresh <span class="trait">weight,</span> shoot <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> (biomass) and total nitrogen content of the symbiotic plants with soybean variety of Heilong 33. When the transconjugants were in symbiotic with soybean variety of Chuanzao No. 1, HN01 (pHN307) could significantly increase its <span class="trait">root</span> nodule number and fresh <span class="trait">weight;</span> GR3 (pHN307) could significantly increase its <span class="trait">root</span> nodule number, nodule fresh <span class="trait">weight,</span> shoot <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> and total nitrogen content, but YC4(pHN307) demonstrated negative effect under the same condition. The results of this study suggested that the introduction of dctABD and <span class="gene">nifA</span> could improve the symbiotic nitrogen fixation efficiency and nodulation ability of the rhizobia tested, respectively, and its effect was relevant to the characteristics of recipient rhizobia and soybean variety.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sucrose synthase (SS) activity has been suggested to be a key point of regulation in nodule metabolism since this enzyme is down-regulated in response to different stresses which lead to decreased nitrogen fixation. In soybean, a dramatic decline of <span class="gene">SS</span> transcripts has been observed within 1 d from the onset of <span class="trait">drought.</span> Such a quick response suggests mediation by a signal transduction molecule. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a likely candidate to act as such a molecule as it mediates in a significant number of plant responses to environmental constraints. The hypothesis of ABA controlling nodule metabolism was approached in this work by assessing nodule responses to exogenous ABA supply in pea. Under the experimental conditions, ABA did not affect plant biomass, nodule numbers or <span class="trait">dry</span> <span class="trait">weight.</span> However, nitrogen fixation rate was reduced by 70% within 5 d and by 80% after 9 d leading to a reduced plant organic nitrogen content. Leghaemoglobin (Lb) content declined in parallel with that of nitrogen fixation. <span class="gene">SS</span> activity, however, was not affected by ABA treatment, and neither were the activities of the enzymes aspartate amino transferase, alkaline invertase, malate dehydrogenase, glutamate synthase, uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and glutamine synthetase. Nodule bacteroid-soluble protein content was reduced in nodules only after 9 d of ABA treatment. These results do not support the hypothesis that ABA directly regulates <span class="gene">SS</span> activity. However, they do suggest the occurrence of at least two different control pathways in nodules under environmental constraints, which include ABA being involved in a Lb/oxygen-related control of nitrogen fixation.

						A phenotyping protocol was developed to evaluate the panel under flooding experiment under greenhouse conditions. The stress conditions and greenhouse temperature were defined based on seven years' rainfall and temperature records (2008&#x02013;2014) in <span class="trait">dry</span> bean growing season in eastern North Dakota (Fargo). These data indicate that the majority of rainfall coincide with V0 to <span class="gene">V2</span> of <span class="trait">dry</span> bean growing stages. Furthermore, the temperature range was between 18 and 20&#x000b0;C at these stages.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Six seeds from each line were planted in pots filled with the same soil type used for germination study. To prevent the soil from spilling out of the pot, a narrow layer of generic potting soil covered the pot drainage holes. All lines were germinated in well-drained conditions. After germination, two healthy seedlings were retained. At the start of the <span class="gene">V2</span> phenological stage (unfolding the primary leaves), the stress-designated plots were exposed to flooding stress. To mimic the flooding conditions in the stress plots, pots were placed in flat storage containers and filled with water until the water level reached 4&#x02013;5 cm above the soil level. In this condition, although the <span class="trait">root</span> system was completely submerged, the leaves were above water. These pots were kept in flooding conditions for 10 days, while the non-flooding plots were grown under well-drained conditions. Non-flooded plants were regularly watered depending on the greenhouse temperature and soil moisture.

						Two flooding-related QTL in soybean were detected that are syntenic with flooding-associated loci in our analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ). The first soybean QTL was located on <span class="gene">Gm18</span> in an interval between 55.6 and 58.0 Mb. This region is syntenic with the Pv08/0.14-5.69 Mb peak in this analysis. Micro-synteny analysis revealed that Sat_064, the closest flooding-associated marker in soybean (VanToai et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr"> 2001 </xref> ; Valliyodan et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr"> 2016 </xref> ), is located between 1.6 and 1.7 Mb of Pv08 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5A </xref> ). In our experiment, this region is detected to be associated with multiple traits but most significantly with <span class="trait">root</span> <span class="trait">weight</span> under flooding (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7"> S2 </xref> ).
