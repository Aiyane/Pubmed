				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/UV/ESI-MSD) was applied to the study of isoflavones in both Edamame and Tofu soy varieties, from which the immature fresh soybeans or the mature soybean seeds are consumed, respectively. Positive atmospheric pressure interface (API) <span class="gene">MS</span> and MS/MS were used to provide molecular mass information and led to the identification of a total 16 isoflavones, including three aglycones, three glycosides, two glycoside acetates, and eight glycoside malonates. The major isoflavones in soybean seeds were daidzein and genistein glycoside and their malonate conjugates. Trace levels of daidzein and genistein acetyl glycosides were found only in the mature dry soybean seeds. To facilitate quantitative analysis, acid hydrolysis during extraction of soy samples was selected to convert the various phytoestrogen conjugates into their respective isoflavone aglycones, allowing accurate quantitation of total phytoestrogens as aglycones. On the basis of HPLC combined with UV and <span class="gene">MS</span> detection, all three targeted soy isoflavone aglycones, daidzein, genistein and <span class="trait">glycitein</span> in hydrolyzed extracts were successfully quantified within 25 min with formononetin used as the internal standard. The standard curves of UV detection were fitted in the range of 14.16-29000 ng/mL for daidzein, 15.38-31500 ng/mL for genistein, and 11.72-24000 ng/mL for <span class="trait">glycitein.</span> For <span class="gene">MS</span> detection, the standard curves were established in the range of 3.54-1812.5 ng/mL for daidzein, 3.85-1968.75 ng/mL for genistein, and 2.93-1500 ng/mL for <span class="trait">glycitein.</span> Good linearities (r(2) &gt; 0.999 for UV and r(2) &gt; 0.99 for MS) for standard curves were achieved for each isoflavone. The accuracy and precision (RSD) were within 10% for UV detection and 15% for <span class="gene">MS</span> detection (n = 10). Using this method, the phytoestrogen levels of total isoflavone aglycones from 30 soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> varieties were then evaluated for confirmation of the technique. Total isoflavones ranged across the varieties from 0.02 to 0.12% in the Edamame varieties, which are harvested while the seeds are still immature, and from 0.16 to 0.25% in Tofu varieties, harvested when the seeds are physiologically mature. While the literature has focused on the isoflavone <span class="trait">content</span> of soy products and processing soy, this report provides a reliable analytical technique for screening of authenticated fresh immature Edamame soybeans and Tofu soybeans.

						Soybean seeds accumulate large amounts of isoflavones (genistein, daidzein and <span class="trait">glycitein),</span> secondary metabolites known for their phytoestrogenic activities. Isoflavone composition depends on the <span class="trait">seed</span> part and <span class="trait">glycitein</span> is almost found exclusively in hypocotyls. Moreover, two major phenotypes are encountered in soybean cultivars, with either low (35 %) or high (55 %) levels of <span class="trait">glycitein</span> in their hypocotyls. This trait was under a quasi-mendelian heredity, implicating at most one or two genes. A <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> cDNA displaying a flavonoid 6-hydroxylase (F6H) activity had previously been isolated from elicitor-induced soybean (Glycine max L.) cells. This enzyme allows the synthesis of the <span class="trait">glycitein</span> flavanone intermediate (6,7,4'- trihydroxyflavanone) by catalyzing the A-ring hydroxylation of liquiritigenin. In this study, the <span class="gene">CYP71D9</span> gene (F6H1) and two other candidates (F6H2 and F6H3) were studied using contrasted soybean cultivars for <span class="trait">glycitein</span> <span class="trait">content</span> (0, 35, 55 and 80 %). Their expression was observed in chitosan elicited leaves. They encode <span class="gene">P450</span> proteins of 496, 469 and 481 amino acids respectively and were expressed in leaves with or without elicitation. The expression patterns of these three genes were performed in cotyledons and hypocotyls at different developmental stages. <span class="gene">F6H1</span> and <span class="gene">F6H2</span> were not expressed in the developing <span class="trait">seed.</span> <span class="gene">F6H3</span> was only expressed in hypocotyls. Its expression levels did not correlate with hypocotyls <span class="trait">glycitein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> but it was not expressed in the null mutant for <span class="trait">glycitein.</span> Thus, this <span class="gene">F6H3</span> gene is a good potential candidate for <span class="trait">glycitein</span> biosynthesis in soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span>

						Owing to the presence of nutritionally important, health-promoting bioactive compounds, especially isoflavones, soybean has acquired the status of a functional food. miRNAs are tiny riboregulator of gene expression by either decreasing and/or increasing the expression of their corresponding target genes. Despite several works on identification and functional characterization of plant miRNAs, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of isoflavones metabolism is still a virgin field. In the present study, we identified a total of 31 new miRNAs along with their 245 putative target genes from soybean seed-specific ESTs using computational approach. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses indicated that miRNA putatively regulates metabolism and genetic information processing. Out of that, a total of 5 miRNAs <span class="gene">(Gma-miRNA12,</span> <span class="gene">Gma-miRNA24,</span> <span class="gene">Gma-miRNA26,</span> <span class="gene">Gma-miRNA28,</span> and <span class="gene">Gma-miRNA29)</span> were predicted and validated for their probable role during isoflavone biosynthesis. We also validated their five target genes using RA-PCR, which is as good as 5'RLM-RACE. Temporal regulation [35 days after flowering, 45, 55, and 65 DAF] of miRNAs and their targets showed differential expression schema. Differential expression of <span class="gene">Gma-miR26</span> and <span class="gene">Gma-miRNA28</span> along with their corresponding target genes <span class="gene">(Glyma.10G197900</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma.09G127200)</span> showed a direct relationship with the total isoflavone <span class="trait">content.</span> Therefore, understanding the miRNA-based genetic regulation of isoflavone pathway would assist in selection and manipulation to get high-performing soybean genotypes with better isoflavone <span class="trait">yield.</span>
