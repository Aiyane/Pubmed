				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Four subunits of beta-conglycinin were purified from soybean cultivar CX 635-1-1-1, and were designated alpha, alpha', beta, and beta' in accordance with nomenclature proposed by Thanh and Shibasaki [(1977) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 490, 370-384]. Of these subunits, beta' has not previously been reported or characterized. Consistent with the low levels of methionine in these proteins, cyanogen bromide cleavage of alpha', alpha, and beta' subunits produced only a few fragments. The beta subunit contains no methionine and was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits are homologous, and each has <span class="trait">valine</span> at its amino terminus. The beta subunit has a very different NH2-terminal sequence from those of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits, and has leucine at its amino terminus. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta' subunit could not be determined, as it appeared to be blocked to Edman degradation. Although alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits have similar NH2-terminal sequences, they differ in the number of methionine residues and so yielded different numbers of cyanogen bromide fragments. Two cyanogen bromide fragments (CB-1 and CB-2) were purified from the alpha subunit. CB-1 originated from the NH2-terminal end of the subunit. The amino acid sequence of CB-2 was identical to that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA clone pB36. The insert in pB36 encoded 216 amino acids from the COOH-terminal end of the alpha subunit and contained a 138-bp trailer sequence which was followed by a poly-(A) tail. Maps showing the relative positions of methionine residues and carbohydrate moieties in the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits were drawn, based on primary sequence data, and the size and carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of the CNBr fragments derived from the subunits.
