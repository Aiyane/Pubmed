				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, we isolated and characterized three distinct orthologues of <span class="gene">WRI1</span> in soybean (Glycine max) that display different organ-specific expression patterns, among which <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> was highly expressed in maturing soybean <span class="trait">seed</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> protein was capable of binding to AW-box, a conserved sequence in the proximal upstream regions of many genes involved in various steps of <span class="trait">oil</span> biosynthesis.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Transgenic soybean seeds overexpressing <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter showed the increased total <span class="trait">oil</span> and fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> and the changed fatty acid composition.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We conclude that <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> transcription factor can positively regulate <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> by a complex gene expression network related to fatty acid biosynthesis.

						Such modifications include functional reduction of <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a/GmWRI1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to WRI1, complementary non-allelic dosage effects of the <span class="gene">GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b</span> homoeologous pair relevant to LEC1, pseudogenization of the singleton <span class="gene">GmLEC2</span> relevant to LEC2, and the rise of the LEC2-like function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b,</span> contrasting to its homoeolog <span class="gene">GmABI3a,</span> which maintains the ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)-like function in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> maturation and dormancy.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The function of <span class="gene">GmABI3b</span> in modulating <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> biosynthesis was fulfilled by direct binding to a RY (CATGCA) cis-regulatory element in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> promoter, which was absent in the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> promoter, resulting in reduction of the <span class="gene">GmWRI1b</span> expression.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Further analysis shows that <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> facilitates <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation by directly activating WRINKLED1, BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2, 3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III, DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1, and OLEOSIN2 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The ZF351 haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (Glycine soja) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> expression leads to increased <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in cultivated soybean.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation, and the manipulation of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> may have great potential in the improvement of <span class="trait">oil</span> production in soybean and other related crops.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Through microarray analysis, a MYB-type gene <italic> <span class="gene">GmMYB73</span> </italic> was identified and this gene can suppress expression of <italic> GL2 (GLABRA 2 </italic> ), a negative regulator of <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22"> 22 </xref>.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Recently, through RNA-seq analysis, gene co-expression networks have been identified for soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> trait regulation and <italic> <span class="gene">GmNFYA</span> (nuclear transcription factor Y alpha </italic> ) is found to enhance <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> contents in transgenic <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26"> 26 </xref>.

						In the present study, a DREB-type (dehydration-responsive element-binding) transcription factor gene <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL,</span> </italic> was cloned and found to increase the <span class="trait">seed</span> lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in the transgenic plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Because the RNA-seq-identified transcription factors are roughly correlated with fatty acid accumulation during soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25"> 25 </xref> , we examined whether the <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> alters the fatty acid accumulation in the overexpressing transgenic lines.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The result showed that overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> significantly enhanced the contents of C18:1, C18:2, C18:3 in all the three transgenic lines and the C20:1 <span class="trait">content</span> in DL-4 overexpression lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"> Fig.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						These results suggest that the <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> increases the <span class="trait">seed</span> size/weight but not the total <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> per plant in transgenic <italic> Arabidopsis </italic>.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression pattern of <italic> <span class="gene">GmABI3</span> </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">GmABI5</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> was determined during soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> development by real-time PCR, and these genes have similar expression pattern ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"> Fig.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our above study indicates that overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> promotes accumulation of fatty acid <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds of transgenic plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"> Fig.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Considering that cultivated soybeans usually had much higher <span class="trait">oil</span> contents compared to the wild soybeans, we investigated whether there is any difference in the expression levels of <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> from cultivated soybean and <italic> GsDREBL </italic> from wild type soybean.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

						We also found that <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> could be sharply induced by <span class="trait">drought</span> and high salt ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Figure S2A,B </xref> ), and overexpressing <italic> <span class="gene">GmDREBL</span> </italic> increased the survival rate of transgenic plants under 200&#x02009;mM NaCl treatment ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Figure S2C,D </xref> ).

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Initially, variants of a type 1 <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from a high-oil, high-oleic acid plant <span class="trait">seed,</span> Corylus americana, were screened for high <span class="trait">oil</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nearly all <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants examined from high-oil strains had increased affinity for oleoyl-CoA, with S0.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants in soybean somatic embryos resulted in <span class="trait">oil</span> contents as high as 10% and 12%, respectively, compared with only 5% and 7.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variant that gave the greatest <span class="trait">oil</span> increase contained 14 amino acid substitutions out of a total of 504 (97% sequence identity with native).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed-preferred expression of this soybean <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> variant increased <span class="trait">oil</span> <span class="trait">content</span> of soybean seeds by an average of 3% (16% relative increase) in highly replicated, single-location field trials.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <span class="gene">DGAT</span> transgenes significantly reduced the soluble carbohydrate <span class="trait">content</span> of mature seeds and increased the <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> of some events.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This study demonstrated that engineering of the native <span class="gene">DGAT</span> enzyme is an effective strategy to improve the <span class="trait">oil</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and value of soybeans.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Therefore, a study was conducted to incorporate one or two mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes into the high oleic acid background to further reduce the linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						As a result, soybean lines with high oleic acid and low linolenic acid (HOLL) <span class="trait">content</span> were produced using different sources of mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> genes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						While oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> of these HOLL lines was stable across two testing environments, the reduction of linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> varied depending on the number of mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes combined with mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes, on the severity of mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene, and on the testing environment.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Combination of two mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes and one mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> gene resulted in less than 2 % linolenic acid <span class="trait">content</span> in Portageville, Missouri (MO) while four mutant genes were needed to achieve the same linolenic acid in Columbia, MO.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two genes encoding <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were identified to be expressed specifically in seeds during embryogenesis and have been considered to hold an important role in controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A total of 22 soybean plant introduction (PI) lines identified to have an elevated oleic acid <span class="trait">content</span> were characterized for sequence mutations in the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Interestingly, soybean lines carrying both homozygous insertion/deletion mutation (indel) <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> alleles and mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles have an average of 82-86% oleic acid <span class="trait">content,</span> compared to 20% in conventional soybean, and low levels of linoleic and linolenic acids.
