						Seed-size/weight traits, controlled by multiple genes in soybean, play an important role in determining <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span> However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> size and weight in soybean remain unclear. In Arabidopsis, P450/CYP78A gene family has been proved extremely relevant to <span class="trait">seed</span> size (such as AtCYP78A5, AtCYP78A6 and AtCYP78A9). We found that a soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene underwent artificial selection during soybean breeding. The <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele mainly distributed in wild soybean (Glycine soja), but has been eliminated in the cultivars during early stage of soybean breeding, while the <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele has been accumulated and become the predominant allele in cultivated soybean (G. max). ANOVA analysis showed that the mean <span class="trait">seed</span> weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> thickness of soybean varieties with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele was significantly heavier/bigger than those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01). The allele could explain 7.2 % variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> weight. The pod number of the soybeans with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele significantly decreased compared to those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01, R(2) = 5.8 %), while other agronomic traits including <span class="trait">seed</span> weight/plant were not significantly affected by these two alleles. We speculated that during the early stage of soybean breeding, breeders selected big <span class="trait">seed</span> carrying <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele, but lowered pod number simultaneously. Overall, the selection did not cause the significantly change in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span> Our results suggests that the soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene may have a similar function to those genes belonging to P450/CYP78A subfamily in Arabidopsis and provides new information for the genetic control of <span class="trait">seed</span> size in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The recently acquired archaeological record for soybean from Japan, China and Korea is shedding light on the context in which this important economic plant became associated with people and was domesticated. This paper examines archaeological (charred) soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> size variation to determine what insight can be gained from a comprehensive comparison of 949 specimens from 22 sites. <span class="trait">Seed</span> length alone appears to represent <span class="trait">seed</span> size change through time, although the length × <span class="trait">width</span> × thickness product has the potential to provide better size change resolution. A widespread early association of small seeded soybean is as old as 9000-8600 <span class="gene">cal</span> BP in northern China and 7000 <span class="gene">cal</span> BP in Japan. Direct AMS radiocarbon dates on charred soybean seeds indicate selection resulted in large <span class="trait">seed</span> sizes in Japan by 5000 <span class="gene">cal</span> BP (Middle Jomon) and in Korea by 3000 <span class="gene">cal</span> BP (Early Mumun). Soybean seeds recovered in China from the Shang through Han periods are similar in length to the large Korean and Japanese specimens, but the overall size of the large Middle and Late Jomon, Early Mumun through Three Kingdom seeds is significantly larger than any of the Chinese specimens. The archaeological record appears to disconfirm the hypothesis of a single domestication of soybean and supports the view informed by recent phyologenetic research that soybean was domesticated in several locations in East Asia.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Round soybean seeds are sought-after for food-type soybean. Also the genetic control of <span class="trait">seed</span> geometry is of scientific interest. The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for <span class="trait">seed</span> shape traits. Three densely mapped recombinant inbred populations each with 192 segregants were used, Minsoy x Archer, Minsoy x Noir1, and Noir1 x Archer. A two <span class="gene">rep</span> two location experiment was conducted in Los Andes, Chile, and East Lansing, MI, USA. <span class="trait">Seed</span> height (SH), <span class="trait">width</span> (SW), length (SL), and <span class="trait">seed</span> volume (SV) as <span class="trait">width</span> x height x length were measured to determine <span class="trait">seed</span> shape. Heritability was estimated by variance component analysis. A total of 19 significant QTLs (LOD &gt;or= 3.7) in ten linkage groups (LG) were detected for all the traits. Only one QTL was stable across populations and environments and six were stable in at least two populations in both environments. The amount of phenotypic variation explained by a single QTL varied from 7.5% for SH, to 18.5% for SW and at least 30% of the genetic variation for the traits is controlled by four QTL or less. All traits were highly correlated with each other in all populations with values ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, except for SL and SW that were not significantly correlated or had a low correlation in all populations. Narrow sense heritabilities for all traits ranged from 0.42 to 0.88. We note that LG u9, u11, and u14 are hot points of the genome for QTLs for various traits. The number and genomic distribution of the QTLs confirms the complex genetic control of <span class="trait">seed</span> shape. Transgressive segregation was observed for all traits suggesting that careful selection of parents with similar phenotypes but different genotypes using molecular markers can result in desirable transgressive segregants.

						The genetic effects of <span class="trait">seed</span> traits in soybean, including 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width,</span> <span class="trait">seed</span> thickness, length/width, length/thickness and width/thickness, were analyzed using an incomplete diallel cross of eight varieties with its F1 and F2 populations. The results showed that the above seven traits were controlled by direct genetic effects of <span class="trait">seed</span> and affected to different extent of maternal and cytoplasmic effects simultaneously. Among the traits, the inheritance of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, length/width, length/thickness, and width/thickness were mainly controlled by cytoplasmic effects, while those of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness were mainly by maternal effects. Both the <span class="trait">seed</span> direct heritabilities and the cytoplsmic heritabilities of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, length/width and width/thickness were medium-sized. The individual selection and <span class="trait">seed</span> selection of above four traits at late generation may create good results. The maternal heritabilities of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness were pretty high. To increase these two traits, an individual maternal selection should be done at early generation. Our results showed that varieties P2 and <span class="gene">P7</span> could be used as ideal parents for improvements of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length/width, length/thickness and width/thickness, while varieties P1, P4 and P6 are the ideal parents for increasing <span class="trait">seed</span> length, <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness respectively.
