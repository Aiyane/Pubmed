				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed-size/weight traits, controlled by multiple genes in soybean, play an important role in determining <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span> However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the <span class="trait">seed</span> size and weight in soybean remain unclear. In Arabidopsis, P450/CYP78A gene family has been proved extremely relevant to <span class="trait">seed</span> size (such as AtCYP78A5, AtCYP78A6 and AtCYP78A9). We found that a soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene underwent artificial selection during soybean breeding. The <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele mainly distributed in wild soybean (Glycine soja), but has been eliminated in the cultivars during early stage of soybean breeding, while the <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele has been accumulated and become the predominant allele in cultivated soybean (G. max). ANOVA analysis showed that the mean <span class="trait">seed</span> weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and <span class="trait">seed</span> thickness of soybean varieties with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele was significantly heavier/bigger than those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01). The allele could explain 7.2 % variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> weight. The pod number of the soybeans with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele significantly decreased compared to those with <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10a</span> allele (P &lt; 0.01, R(2) = 5.8 %), while other agronomic traits including <span class="trait">seed</span> weight/plant were not significantly affected by these two alleles. We speculated that during the early stage of soybean breeding, breeders selected big <span class="trait">seed</span> carrying <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10b</span> allele, but lowered pod number simultaneously. Overall, the selection did not cause the significantly change in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield.</span> Our results suggests that the soybean <span class="gene">GmCYP78A10</span> gene may have a similar function to those genes belonging to P450/CYP78A subfamily in Arabidopsis and provides new information for the genetic control of <span class="trait">seed</span> size in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The genetic effects of <span class="trait">seed</span> traits in soybean, including 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width,</span> <span class="trait">seed</span> thickness, length/width, length/thickness and width/thickness, were analyzed using an incomplete diallel cross of eight varieties with its F1 and F2 populations. The results showed that the above seven traits were controlled by direct genetic effects of <span class="trait">seed</span> and affected to different extent of maternal and cytoplasmic effects simultaneously. Among the traits, the inheritance of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, length/width, length/thickness, and width/thickness were mainly controlled by cytoplasmic effects, while those of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness were mainly by maternal effects. Both the <span class="trait">seed</span> direct heritabilities and the cytoplsmic heritabilities of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length, length/width and width/thickness were medium-sized. The individual selection and <span class="trait">seed</span> selection of above four traits at late generation may create good results. The maternal heritabilities of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness were pretty high. To increase these two traits, an individual maternal selection should be done at early generation. Our results showed that varieties P2 and <span class="gene">P7</span> could be used as ideal parents for improvements of 100-seed weight, <span class="trait">seed</span> length/width, length/thickness and width/thickness, while varieties P1, P4 and P6 are the ideal parents for increasing <span class="trait">seed</span> length, <span class="trait">width</span> and thickness respectively.
