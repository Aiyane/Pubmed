				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Putrescine is synthesized using one of two alternative pathways in plants, from <span class="trait">arginine</span> by <span class="trait">arginine</span> decarboxylase (ADC) or from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and is catabolized by diamine oxidase (DAO). A survey of approximately 310,000 expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) in soybean EST libraries identified diverse representation of ADC, ODC, and <span class="gene">DAO</span> ESTs, with ODC being least frequent and <span class="gene">DAO</span> ESTs most abundant. Southern analysis suggested that ADC and ODC belong to small gene families, and <span class="gene">DAO</span> is the most divergent. Using three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries, 26X genome equivalents, two common loci for ADC and <span class="gene">DAO</span> and one independent <span class="gene">DAO</span> locus were identified. ADC and <span class="gene">DAO</span> are physically linked in the soybean genome within approximately 150 kb. Identification of genomic regions encoding ODC proved difficult and required using additional BAC libraries, increasing genome coverage to approximately 40X. Using Real Time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), higher steady-state levels of ADC than ODC in roots, leaves, shoot apices, and dry seeds suggested that ADC is the predominant pathway for putrescine biosynthesis in soybean. However, organ-specific expression showed that root is the major site of ODC transcription. Significantly elevated accumulation of ADC mRNA and elevated putrescine <span class="trait">content</span> in seeds of the fasciation mutant compared with the wild type may stimulate cell divisions and establishment of enlarged apical meristem during early mutant ontogeny. The <span class="gene">DAO</span> frequent representation in EST libraries constructed from root tissue and elevated steady-state levels in roots compared to above ground tissues show <span class="gene">DAO</span> is critical for regulation of putrescine <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean roots.
