						Both genotypes were negatively affected by <span class="trait">flooding</span> at the one-leaf, early vegetative <span class="gene">V1</span> stage. However, the effects of <span class="trait">flooding</span> were more severe in S99-2281 than PI408105A, confirming the results obtained from field-based screening efforts [ <xref rid="B48-ijms-15-17622" ref-type="bibr"> 48 </xref> ]. Roots of S99-2281 plants had less biomass than roots of the tolerant PI488105A plants, especially at the 10th day of <span class="trait">flooding</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-15-17622-f001"> Figure 1 </xref> A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-15-17622-f002"> Figure 2 </xref> ). Additionally, solute leakage was also lower from PI408105A roots at the 10th day of <span class="trait">flooding</span> than from S99-2281 roots (data not shown). These results revealed that adaptation to <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress occurred earlier and was more pronounced in the flood tolerant genotype than in the flood sensitive genotype.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The ten genes that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes at the 1st and 3rd days of <span class="trait">flooding</span> included the <italic> ADH1 </italic> gene, a known anaerobic gene. The other nine genes were TFs, which included the Dehydration-Responsive Element Binding gene 3 ( <italic> <span class="gene">DREB3</span> </italic> ) and the soybean <italic> <span class="gene">NAC1</span> </italic> domain gene. Expression of genes in this group was lower in PI408105A roots than in S99-2281 roots ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-15-17622-f005"> Figure 5 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The three genes that differentially expressed during the first three time points (1st, 3rd and 7th day) of <span class="trait">flooding,</span> included <italic> LBD41 </italic> , the soybean <italic> <span class="gene">NAC2</span> </italic> transcription factor and a DNA binding protein. At the 1st day of <span class="trait">flooding,</span> expression of the genes in this group was lower in PI408105A roots than in S99-2281 roots. Expression increased in PI408105A roots at the 3rd day and remained high at the 7th day of <span class="trait">flooding,</span> but decreased to lower levels in S99-2281 roots at this late time point.

						Of the three TF genes with consistently different expression between the two genotypes at all four time points, the leucine zipper S23061205 has been annotated to be induced in soybean roots by <span class="trait">drought</span> stress [ <xref rid="B74-ijms-15-17622" ref-type="bibr"> 74 </xref> ]. Sequence homology searches of the <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> TAIR BLAST 2.2.8 database showed that this gene has high homology to <span class="gene">At1g72040</span> ( <italic> E </italic> value = 0.012), which codes for a nucleus located ATP-binding phosphotransferase enzyme involved in the nucleic acid metabolic process. Induced by cytokinin, <span class="gene">At1g72040</span> has been shown to be involved in the cytokinin signaling pathway [ <xref rid="B75-ijms-15-17622" ref-type="bibr"> 75 </xref> ]. Interestingly, this leucine zipper S23061205 also shares sequence homology with At5g27760 ( <italic> E </italic> value = 0.18), which was classified as &#x0201c;a hypoxia-responsive family protein&#x0201d;. The second TF in this group is the MYB domain S487749 gene, which showed very high sequence homology with At3g11450, a <span class="gene">DNAJ</span> heat shock <italic> N </italic> -terminal domain-containing protein ( <italic> E </italic> value = 5 &#x000d7; 10 <sup> &#x02212;14 </sup> ). The <span class="gene">DNAJ</span> heat shock protein functions in coordinating stress responses through protein folding for translocation across organelle membranes. The third TF, a MYB-domain transcription factor S4910460, showed sequence homology with the <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> gene At5g47390 ( <italic> E </italic> value = 0.069). At5g47390 is one of the 29 <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> transcription repressors recently identified in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> [ <xref rid="B76-ijms-15-17622" ref-type="bibr"> 76 </xref> ]. Expression of this gene is responsive to salt stress and cadmium ion toxicity as well as to many plant hormones including abscisic acid, ethylene, gibberellin, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid [ <xref rid="B77-ijms-15-17622" ref-type="bibr"> 77 </xref> ].

Plants in the control treatment were also placed into 19-L tubs but without the plastic liner and only watered to maintain normal growth without stress. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Root measurements and samples were taken at 1, 3, 7 and 10 days of <span class="trait">flooding.</span>

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Circadian clocks are a great evolutionary innovation and provide competitive advantage during the day/night cycle and under changing environmental conditions. The circadian clock mediates expression of a large proportion of genes in plants, achieving a harmonious relationship between energy metabolism, photosynthesis, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. Here it is shown that multiple paralogues of clock genes are present in soybean (Glycine max) and mediate <span class="trait">flooding</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> responses. Differential expression of many clock and <span class="gene">SUB1</span> genes was found under <span class="trait">flooding</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Furthermore, natural variation in the amplitude and phase shifts in PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> genes was also discovered under <span class="trait">drought</span> and <span class="trait">flooding</span> conditions, respectively. PRR3 exhibited <span class="trait">flooding-</span> and drought-specific splicing patterns and may work in concert with PRR7 and <span class="gene">TOC1</span> to achieve energy homeostasis under <span class="trait">flooding</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. Higher expression of <span class="gene">TOC1</span> also coincides with elevated levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and variation in glucose levels in the morning and afternoon, indicating that this response to abiotic stress is mediated by ABA, endogenous sugar levels, and the circadian clock to fine-tune photosynthesis and energy utilization under stress conditions. It is proposed that the presence of multiple clock gene paralogues with variation in DNA sequence, phase, and period could be used to screen exotic germplasm to find sources for <span class="trait">drought</span> and <span class="trait">flooding</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Furthermore, fine tuning of multiple clock gene paralogues (via a genetic engineering approach) should also facilitate the development of <span class="trait">flooding-</span> and drought-tolerant soybean varieties.

						In soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), varieties with seed-flooding <span class="trait">tolerance</span> at the geminating stage are desirable for breeding in countries with much rainfall at sowing time. Our study revealed great intervarietal variation in seed-flooding <span class="trait">tolerance</span> as evaluated by germination rate (GR) and normal seedling rate (NS). Pigmented seed coat and small seed weight tended to give a positive effect on seed-flooding <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Subsequently, QTL analysis of <span class="gene">GR</span> and NS were performed and a total of four QTLs were detected. Among them, Sft1 on the linkage group H (LG_H) exhibited a large effect on <span class="gene">GR</span> after a 24-h treatment; however, Sft2 near the I locus on LG_A2 involved in seed coat pigmentation exhibited the largest effect on seed-flooding <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> Sft1, Sft3 and Sft4 were independent of seed coat color and seed weight. Based on the results, we discussed the physiological effects of genetic factors responsible for seed-flooding <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean.

						Soybean is highly sensitive to <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress and exhibits markedly reduced plant growth and grain <span class="trait">yield</span> under <span class="trait">flooding</span> conditions. To explore the mechanisms underlying initial <span class="trait">flooding</span> <span class="trait">tolerance</span> in soybean, RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis was performed using a flooding-tolerant line and ABA-treated soybean. A total of 31 genes included 12 genes that exhibited similar temporal patterns were commonly changed in these plant groups in response to <span class="trait">flooding</span> and they were mainly involved in RNA regulation and protein metabolism. The mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, ATPase family <span class="gene">AAA</span> domain-containing protein 1, and cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> 77A1 was up-regulated in wild-type soybean under <span class="trait">flooding</span> conditions; however, no changes were detected in the flooding-tolerant line or ABA-treated soybean. The mRNA expression of cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> 77A1 was specifically up-regulated in root tips by <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress, but returned to the level found in control plants following treatment with the <span class="gene">P450</span> inhibitor uniconazole. The survival ratio and root fresh weight of plants were markedly improved by 3-h uniconazole treatment under <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress. Taken together, these results suggest that cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> 77A1 is suppressed by uniconazole treatment and that this inhibition may enhance soybean <span class="trait">tolerance</span> to <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean, one of the most important crops worldwide, is severely affected by abiotic stress. <span class="trait">Drought</span> and <span class="trait">flooding</span> are the major abiotic stresses impacting soybean <span class="trait">yield.</span> In this regard, understanding water uptake by plants, its utilization and transport has great importance. In plants, water transport is mainly governed by channel forming aquaporin proteins (AQPs). Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) belong to the plant-specific AQP subfamily and are known to have a role in abiotic stress <span class="trait">tolerance.</span> In this study, 23 soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes were identified based on the latest soybean genome annotation. TIPs were characterized based on conserved structural features and phylogenetic distribution. Expression analysis of soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes in various tissues and under abiotic stress conditions demonstrated tissue/stress-response specific differential expression. The natural variations for <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes were analyzed using whole genome re-sequencing data available for a set of 106 diverse soybean genotypes including wild types, landraces and elite lines. Results revealed 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and several large insertions/deletions in the coding region of TIPs. Among these, non-synonymous SNPs are most likely to have a greater impact on protein function and are candidates for molecular studies as well as for the development of functional markers to assist breeding. The solute transport function of two TIPs was further validated by expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. <span class="gene">GmTIP1;5</span> was shown to facilitate the rapid movement of water across the oocyte membrane, while <span class="gene">GmTIP2;5</span> facilitated the movement of water and boric acid. The present study provides an initial insight into the possible roles of soybean <span class="gene">TIP</span> genes under abiotic stress conditions. Our results will facilitate elucidation of their precise functions during abiotic stress responses and plant development, and will provide potential breeding targets for modifying water movement in soybean.

						Within the root system, the tip portion of the primary roots plays an essential role in seedling establishment. <span class="trait">Flooding</span> induced cell death in the root tip region and a subsequent suppression in root elongation have been reported in flooded soybean seedlings [ <xref rid="B17-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 17 </xref> ]. Predominant proteins involved in stress response, glycolysis, redox homeostasis, and protein processing found to be located in differentiated root zones including root apex with different abundances [ <xref rid="B36-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 36 </xref> ]. Gel free <span class="gene">MS</span> based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics approaches have been well exploited to enumerate the altered protein relative abundance profiles of soybean root tips under <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress [ <xref rid="B17-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 17 </xref> ]. Classification of differentially accumulated proteins revealed that majority of the proteins involved in glycolysis, fermentation, cell wall metabolism and nucleotide metabolism were increased; while, the relative abundance of most of the proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and cell organization were decreased. In addition, few proteins including sucrose-binding protein, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases, actins, and alpha-tubulins, were found to be accumulated specifically in the root tip region. Accumulation of sucrose-binding proteins in flooded soybean root tips suggests an enhanced sucrose accumulation. This observation is in agreement with the finding, reported previously in soybean roots and hypocotyls [ <xref rid="B16-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 16 </xref> ]. Furthermore, Yanagawa and Komatsu [ <xref rid="B43-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 43 </xref> ] reported that <span class="trait">flooding,</span> and not the hypoxic condition, was responsible for the root tip degradation resulting from ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis, as these injuries were independent of the oxygen concentration. It is believed that the Ub/proteasome-mediated proteolysis of enzymes involved in glycolysis and fermentation pathways may be negatively controlled under the hypoxic condition caused by <span class="trait">flooding</span> [ <xref rid="B3-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> ]. Previous gel and gel-free <span class="gene">MS</span> based proteomic study by Nanjo <italic> et al </italic> . [ <xref rid="B16-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 16 </xref> ] has also revealed differential regulation of 20S proteasome subunits in flooded soybean. Altered expression of each 20S proteasome subunit in response to <span class="trait">flooding</span> stress may thus affect the amount as well as the activity of the 26S proteasome, thereby altering <span class="trait">flooding</span> <span class="trait">tolerance.</span>
					</p>

						The ultimate success of any proteomic approach depends upon various factors including isolation of full component of proteins, separation, visualization and their accurate identification. In spite of recent advancement, more emphasis needs to be given on the protein extraction protocols, in particular for very low and high abundance proteins. In soybean root, identification of low abundance of signaling proteins, transcription factors and their protein complexes is often a challenge for 2-DE based proteomic techniques. Nanjo <italic> et al </italic> . [ <xref rid="B17-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 17 </xref> ] adapted a gel free analysis of complete root-tip proteome, in which protein samples were reduced and alkylated in a denaturing solution followed by trypsin digestion. Trypsin-digested samples were then injected on nanoLC coupled to MS/MS. This method allows detection of <span class="gene">MS</span> peaks with up to 5000 times differences in abundance. In order to determine the composition of plant protein complexes, Smaczniak <italic> et al </italic> . [ <xref rid="B55-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 55 </xref> ] used another, rather more sensitive fluorophore-tagged protein immunoprecipitation and label-free MS-based quantification techniques to facilitate identification of low abundance signaling and regulatory protein complexes from native plant tissues. Furthermore, an advanced technique like laser-capture micro-dissection [ <xref rid="B56-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 56 </xref> ] for tissue proteomics could be used further for accurate identification of tissue- and cell-specific proteins involved in plant response to abiotic stresses. Gil-Quintana <italic> et al </italic> . [ <xref rid="B57-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 57 </xref> ] reported proteomic analysis of root nodules of <span class="trait">drought</span> stressed soybean using shotgun proteomics technique. In order to have complete proteome of root nodules, including all low abundance proteins, protein digests were analysed via shotgun nano-LC-ultra using a monolithic reversed-phase column directly coupled to an Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer [ <xref rid="B58-proteomes-02-00107" ref-type="bibr"> 58 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Instead of several limitations and challenges, soybean proteomics has proved itself as a valuable tool for identifying stress responsive target proteins with a clear picture of translational and post translational modification. More research works at the proteome level need to be undertaken for better understanding the minute changes in a cell&#x02019;s protein signature to cope with the <span class="trait">flooding</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Comparative organelle proteomes studies would be a great contribution towards understanding the cross-talk between stress signaling pathways. The convergence of diverse <span class="gene">MS</span> techniques coupled with bioinformatics technology with improved sample preparation and fractionation strategies is further needed to get a more precise and comprehensive picture of plant stress response mechanisms.
