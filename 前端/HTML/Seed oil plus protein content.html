				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Superior crop cultivars must be identified through multi-environment trials (MET) and on the basis of multiple traits. The objectives of this paper were to describe two types of biplots, the GGE biplot and the GT biplot, which graphically display genotype by environment data and genotype by trait data, respectively, and hence facilitate cultivar evaluation on the basis of <span class="gene">MET</span> data and multiple traits. Genotype main effect <span class="trait">plus</span> genotype by environment interaction effect (GGE) biplot analysis of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">yield</span> data for the 2800 crop heat unit area of Ontario for <span class="gene">MET</span> in the period 1994-1999 revealed yearly crossover genotype by site interactions. The eastern Ontario site Winchester showed a different genotype response pattern from the three southwestern Ontario sites in four of the six years. The interactions were not large enough to divide the area into different mega-environments as when analyzed over years, a single cultivar yielded the best in all four sites. The southwestern site, St. Pauls, was found to always group together with at least one of the other three sites; it did not provide unique information on genotype performance. Therefore, in future cultivar evaluations, Winchester should always be used but St. Pauls can be dismissed. Applying GT biplot to the 1994-1999 multiple trait data illustrated that GT biplots graphically displayed the interrelationships among <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield,</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> <span class="trait">protein</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> plant height, and days to maturity, among other traits, and facilitated visual cultivar comparisons and selection. It was found that selection for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> alone was not only the simplest, but also the most effective strategy in the early stages of soybean breeding.
