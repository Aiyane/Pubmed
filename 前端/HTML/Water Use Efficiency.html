					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Abscisic acid-responsive element binding protein (AREB1) is a basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element motif in the promoter region of ABA-inducible genes. Because <span class="gene">AREB1</span> is not sufficient to direct the expression of downstream genes under non-stress conditions, an activated form of <span class="gene">AREB1</span> (AREB1ΔQT) was created. Several reports claim that plants overexpressing <span class="gene">AREB1</span> or AREB1ΔQT show improved <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance. In our studies, soybean plants overexpressing AREB1ΔQT were characterized molecularly, and the phenotype and <span class="trait">drought</span> response of three lines were accessed under greenhouse conditions. Under conditions of <span class="trait">water</span> deficit, the transformed plants presented a higher survival rate (100%) than those of their isoline, cultivar BR 16 (40%). Moreover, the transformed plants displayed better <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and had a higher number of leaves than their isoline. Because the transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductance than its isoline under well-watered conditions, it was suggested that the enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> response of AREB1ΔQT soybean plants might not be associated with altered transpiration rates mediated by ABA-dependent stomatal closure. However, it is possible that the smaller leaf area of the transgenic plants reduced their transpiration and <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use,</span> causing delayed stress onset. The difference in the degree of wilting and percentage of survival between the 35S-AREB1ΔQT and wildtype plants may also be related to the regulation of genes that protect against dehydration because metabolic impairment of photosynthesis, deduced by an increasing internal CO2 concentration, was not observed in the transgenic plants.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Although terrestrial CO2 concentrations [CO2] are not expected to reach 1000 μmol mol(-1) (or ppm) for many decades, CO2 levels in closed systems such as growth chambers and greenhouses can easily exceed this concentration. CO2 levels in life support systems (LSS) in space can exceed 10,000 ppm (1 %). In order to understand how photosynthesis in <span class="gene">C4</span> plants may respond to elevated CO2, it is necessary to determine if leaves of closed artificial ecosystem grown plants have a fully developed <span class="gene">C4</span> photosynthetic apparatus, and whether or not photosynthesis in these leaves is more responsive to elevated [CO2] than leaves of <span class="gene">C3</span> plants. To address this issue, we evaluated the response of gas exchange, <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> and photosynthetic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of PSII by soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr., 'Heihe35') of a typical <span class="gene">C3</span> plant and maize (Zea mays L., 'Susheng') of <span class="gene">C4</span> plant under four CO2 concentrations (500, 1000, 3000, and 5000 ppm), which were grown under controlled environmental conditions of Lunar Palace 1. The results showed that photosynthetic pigment by the <span class="gene">C3</span> plants of soybean was more sensitive to elevated [CO2] below 3000 ppm than the <span class="gene">C4</span> plants of maize. Elevated [CO2] to 1000 ppm induced a higher initial photosynthetic rate, while super-elevated [CO2] appeared to negate such initial growth promotion for <span class="gene">C3</span> plants. The <span class="gene">C4</span> plant had the highest ETR, φPSII, and qP under 500-3000 ppm [CO2], but then decreased substantially at 5000 ppm [CO2] for both species. Therefore, photosynthetic down-regulation and a decrease in photosynthetic electron transport occurred by both species in response to super-elevated [CO2] at 3000 and 5000 ppm. Accordingly, plants can be selected for and adapt to the efficient <span class="trait">use</span> of elevated CO2 concentration in LSS.

						Understanding the variability of plant WUE and its control mechanism can promote the comprehension to the coupling relationship of <span class="trait">water</span> and carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystem, which is the foundation for developing water-carbon coupling cycle model. In this paper, we made clear the differences of net assimilation rate, transpiration rate, and WUE between the two species by comparing the experiment data of soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) plants under <span class="trait">water</span> and soil nutrient stresses. WUE of maize was about two and a half times more than that of soybean in the same weather conditions. Enhancement of <span class="trait">water</span> stresses led to the marked decrease of Am and <span class="gene">Em</span> of two species, but <span class="trait">water</span> stresses of some degree could improve WUE, and this effect was more obvious for soybean. WUE of the two species changed with psiL in a second-order curve relation, and the WUE at high fertilization was higher than that at low fertilization, this effect was especially obvious for maize. Moreover, according to the synthetic model of photosynthesis-transpiration based on stomatal behavior (SMPTSB) presented by Yu et al. (2001), the WUE model and its applicability were discussed with the data measured in this experiment. The WUE estimated by means of the model accorded well with the measured values. However, this model underestimated the WUE for maize slightly, thus further improvement on the original model was made in this study. Finally, by discussing some physiological factors controlling Am and WUE, we made clear the physiological explanation for differences of the relative contributions of stomata- and mesophyll processes to control of Am and WUE, and the applicability of WUE model between the two species. Because the requirement to stomatal conductance by unit change of net assimilation rate is different, the responses of opening-closing activity of stomata to environmental stresses are different between the two species. To obtain the same level of net assimilation rate, soybean has to open its stomata more widely to keep small stomatal <span class="trait">resistance,</span> as compared with maize.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Drought</span> stress has long been a major constraint in maintaining <span class="trait">yield</span> stability of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in rainfed ecosystems. The identification of consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) involving seed <span class="trait">yield</span> per plant (YP) and <span class="trait">drought</span> susceptibility index (DSI) in a population across different environments would therefore be important in molecular marker-assisted breeding of soybean cultivars suitable for rainfed regions. The YP of a recombinant line population of 184 F(2:7:11) lines from a cross of Kefeng1 and Nannong1138-2 was studied under water-stressed (WS) and well-watered (WW) conditions in field (F) and greenhouse (G) trials, and DSI for <span class="trait">yield</span> was calculated in two trials. Nineteen QTLs associated with YP-WS and YP-WW, and 10 QTLs associated with DSI, were identified. Comparison of these QTL locations with previous findings showed that the majority of these regions control one or more traits related to <span class="trait">yield</span> and other agronomic traits. One QTL on molecular linkage group (MLG) K for YP-F, and two QTLs on MLG <span class="gene">C2</span> for YP-G, remained constant across different <span class="trait">water</span> regimes. The regions on MLG <span class="gene">C2</span> for YP-WW-F and MLG H for YP-WS-F had a pleiotropic effect on DSI-F, and MLG A1 for YP-WS-G had a pleiotropic effect on DSI-G. The identification of consistent QTLs for YP and DSI across different environments will significantly improve the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of selecting for <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A field experiment was conducted to study the effects of foliar spraying three compound agents [plant polysaccharides (P1), plant polysaccharides and 5-aminolevulinic acid (P2), and plant polysaccharides and 5-aminolevulinic acid and dimethylpiperidinium chloride (P3)] at the initial flowering stage of soybean on its leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthesis and transpiration, dry matter accumulation and allocation, and grain <span class="trait">yield.</span> Within 35 days after spraying the three compound agents, the leaf chlorophyll content had obvious increase, and its decreasing trend with plant growth had somewhat delay. Compared with the control, spraying <span class="gene">P1</span> and P3 increased the leaf photosynthetic rate and <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> by more than 13.2% and 10.3%, respectively. With the spraying of the three compound agents, the dry matter accumulation in aerial part increased, and the allocation of dry matter from leaf to pod was also enhanced, with the contribution of post-anthesis assimilates to grain <span class="trait">yield</span> increased by more than 17.1%. The 100-grain mass and the pods and seeds per plant increased significantly after spraying <span class="gene">P1</span> and P3, but had no significant increase after spraying P2. The grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of soybean treated with the three compound agents increased by more than 5.9%, compared with the control. This study showed that the three plant polysaccharide compound agents could increase the leaf chlorophyll content, delay the leaf-senescence, improve the leaf photosynthetic capacity and <span class="trait">water</span> status, effectively control the dry matter accumulation and post-anthesis assimilates allocation, and increase the grain <span class="trait">yield</span> of soybean.

						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and <span class="trait">water</span> deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::GmEXPB2-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and P uptake, especially at low P levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and P uptake at both low and high P levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by Fe and mild <span class="trait">water</span> deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including P, Fe and <span class="trait">water</span> deficiency. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and P responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop P uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.

						Elevated atmospheric CO2 can influence the structure and function of rhizoplane and rhizosphere microorganisms by altering root growth and the quality and quantity of compounds released into the rhizoplane and rhizosphere via root exudation. In these studies we investigated the transcriptional responses of Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells growing in the rhizoplane of soybean plants exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2. The results of microarray analyses indicated that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration indirectly influenced the expression of a large number of genes in Bradyrhizobium attached to soybean roots. In addition, relative to plants and bacteria grown under ambient CO2 growth conditions, genes involved in <span class="gene">C1</span> metabolism, denitrification and FixK2-associated genes, including those involved in nitrogen fixation, microaerobic respiration, respiratory nitrite reductase, and heme biosynthesis, were significantly up-regulated under conditions of elevated CO2 in the rhizosphere. The expression profile of genes involved in lipochitooligosaccharide Nod factor biosynthesis and negative transcriptional regulators of nodulation genes, <span class="gene">nolA</span> and nodD2, were also influenced by plant growth under conditions of elevated CO2. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that the growth of soybeans under conditions of elevated atmospheric CO2 influences gene expressions in B. japonicum in the soybean rhizoplane, resulting in changes to carbon/nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and nodulation <span class="trait">efficiency.</span>

						The effect of humidity on the gas exchange of leaves of the dicotyledons soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (L.) Schneider), and saltbush (Atriplex halimus L.) and the monocotyledons wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) was examined under conditions of adequate soil moisture in a controlled environment. Photosynthesis and stomatal and internal diffusion resistances of whole, attached, single leaves were not affected by changes in humidity as the vapour pressure deficit between the leaf and atmosphere ranged from 8 to 27 mb. Transpiration increased linearly with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Whole plants of barley exhibited a different response. As humidity was increased, photosynthesis increased, transpiration expressed per unit of vapour pressure difference increased, and diffusion resistances became smaller. Reasons for the different behaviour of single leaves and whole plants are suggested. An index for <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> expressed per millibar of vapour pressure deficit, was calculated for single leaves of each species used in the experiments. This showed that <span class="trait">water</span> <span class="trait">use</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> was highest in the <span class="gene">C4</span> xerophytes and lowest in the <span class="gene">C3</span> mesophytes.

						The combination of degrading natural conditions and resources, climate change, growing population, urban development, and competition in a global market complicate optimization of land for agricultural products. The <span class="trait">use</span> of pesticides and fertilizers for crop production in the agricultural fields has become excessive in the recent years and Golestan Province of Iran is no exception in this regard. For this, effective management with an efficient and cost-effective practice should be undertaken, maintaining public service at a high level and preserving the environment. Improving the production <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of agriculture, efficient <span class="trait">use</span> of <span class="trait">water</span> resources, decreasing the <span class="trait">use</span> of pesticides and fertilizers, improving farmer revenue, and conservation of natural resources are the main objectives of the allocation, ranking, and optimization of agricultural products. The goal of this paper is to <span class="trait">use</span> an optimization procedure to lower the negative effects of agriculture while maintaining a high production rate, which is currently a <span class="gene">gap</span> in the study area. We collected information about fertilizer and pesticide consumption and other data in croplands of eastern Golestan Province through face-to-face interviews with farmers to optimize cultivation of the agricultural products. The toxicity of pesticides according to LD50 was also included in the optimization model. A decision-support software system called multiple criteria analysis tool was used to simultaneously minimize consumption of <span class="trait">water,</span> chemical fertilizers, and pesticides and maximize socio-economic returns. Three scenarios for optimization of agricultural products were generated that alternatively emphasized on environmental and socio-economic goals. Comparing socio-economic and environmental performance of the optimized agricultural products under the three scenarios illustrated the conflict between social, economic, and environmental objectives. Of the six crops studied (wheat, barley, rice, soybeans, oilseed rape, and maize), rice ranked second in the social and fifth in the economic scenarios. Soybeans had the lowest rank for economic and social scenarios and its cultivation in the study area, in terms of economic and social goals, was rejected by the model. However, cultivation of soybeans continues in the area as a responsibility to cater for the major need of the country. Because of subsidized prices of <span class="trait">water,</span> fertilizers, and pesticides, the <span class="trait">use</span> of these items are far from optimized in the current agricultural practices in the area.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Despite extensive studies in eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenases, functional information about the ALDH7 antiquitin-like proteins is lacking. A soybean antiquitin homologue gene, designated <span class="gene">GmTP55,</span> has been isolated which encodes a dehydrogenase motif-containing 55 kDa protein induced by dehydration and salt stress. <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> is closely related to the stress-induced plant antiquitin-like proteins that belong to the ALDH7 family. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants constitutively expressing <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> have been obtained in order to examine the physiological role of this enzyme under a variety of stress conditions. Ectopic expression of <span class="gene">GmTP55</span> in both Arabidopsis and tobacco conferred tolerance to salinity during germination and to <span class="trait">water</span> deficit during plant growth. Under salt stress, the germination <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of both transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis seeds was significantly higher than that of their control counterparts. Likewise, under progressive <span class="trait">drought,</span> the transgenic tobacco lines apparently kept the shoot turgidity to a normal level, which contrasted with the leaf wilt phenotype of control plants. The transgenic plants also exhibited an enhanced tolerance to H(2)O(2)- and paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Both <span class="gene">GmTP55-expressing</span> Arabidopsis and tobacco seeds germinated efficiently in medium supplemented with H(2)O(2), whereas the germination of control seeds was drastically impaired. Similarly, transgenic tobacco leaf discs treated with paraquat displayed a significant reduction in the necrotic lesions as compared with control leaves. These transgenic lines also exhibited a lower concentration of lipid peroxidation-derived reactive aldehydes under oxidative stress. These results suggest that antiquitin may be involved in adaptive responses mediated by a physiologically relevant detoxification pathway in plants.

						We tested the hypothesis that increasing the number of metaxylem vessels would enhance the <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of <span class="trait">water</span> uptake in soybean (Glycine max) and decrease the <span class="trait">yield</span> <span class="gene">gap</span> in water-limited environments. A panel of 41 soybean accessions was evaluated in greenhouse, rainout shelter, and rain-fed field environments. The metaxylem number influenced the internal capture of CO2 and improved stomatal conductance, enhancing <span class="trait">water</span> uptake/use in soybeans exposed to stress during the reproductive stage. We determined that other root anatomical features, such as cortex cell area and the percentage of stele that comprised cortical cells, also affected seed <span class="trait">yield</span> under similar growth parameters. Seed <span class="trait">yield</span> was also impacted by pod retention rates under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress (24-80 pods/plant). We surmise that effective biomass allocation, that is, the transport of available photosynthates to floral structures at late reproductive growth stages (R6-R7), enables <span class="trait">yield</span> protection under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. A mesocosm study of contrasting lines for <span class="trait">yield</span> under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress and root anatomical features revealed that increases in metaxylem number as an adaptation to <span class="trait">drought</span> in the high-yielding lines improved root hydraulic conductivity, which reduced the metabolic cost of exploring <span class="trait">water</span> in deeper soil strata and enhanced <span class="trait">water</span> transport. This allowed the maintenance of shoot physiological processes under water-limited conditions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This study investigated and compared reaction kinetics, product characterization, and toxicity variation of triclosan (TCS) removal mediated by soybean peroxidase (SBP), a recognized potential peroxidase for removing phenolic pollutants, and the commonly used horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with the goal of assessing the technical feasibility of SBP-catalyzed removal of TCS. Reaction conditions such as pH, H2O2 concentration and enzyme dosage were found to have a strong influence on the removal <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of TCS. <span class="gene">SBP</span> can retain its catalytic ability to remove TCS over broad ranges of pH and H2O2 concentration, while the optimal pH and H2O2 concentration were 7.0 and 8μM, respectively. 98% TCS was removed with only 0.1UmL(-1) <span class="gene">SBP</span> in 30min reaction time, while an HRP dose of 0.3UmL(-1) was required to achieve the similar conversion. The catalytic performance of <span class="gene">SBP</span> towards TCS was more efficient than that of HRP, which can be explained by catalytic rate constant (KCAT) and catalytic <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (KCAT/KM) for the two enzymes. <span class="gene">MS</span> analysis in combination with quantum chemistry computation showed that the polymerization products were generated via CC and CO coupling pathways. The polymers were proved to be nontoxic through growth inhibition of green alga (Scenedesmus obliquus). Taking into consideration of the enzymatic treatment cost, <span class="gene">SBP</span> may be a better alternative to HRP upon the removal and detoxification of TCS in water/wastewater treatment.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This paper describes a comparison between horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soybean peroxidase (SBP), the two most widely used commercial peroxidases for the removal of phenol from wastewater. Both enzymes achieve maximal removal <span class="trait">efficiency</span> in a neutral pH medium although they are still quite active in a pH range of between 6.0 and 8.0. The fact that both enzymes show similar phenol elimination levels at any temperature between 25 and 40 degrees C is also of interest. Studies were carried out in the absence and presence of different concentrations of a stabilisation additive, polyethylene glycol (PEG), in an attempt to optimise the phenol elimination procedure. The final choice of peroxidase will depend on the characteristics of the effluent, operational requirements and on economic considerations. Our findings show that HRP acts faster than <span class="gene">SBP</span> but is more susceptible to inactivation, although it is better protected by PEG. In consequence HRP will be the most suitable choice but the addition of a sufficient amount of PEG is critical.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: The objective of this work was to study the preparation and characteristics of zedoary turmeric oil (ZTO), a traditional Chinese oily medicine, loaded with nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). METHOD: Aqueous dispersions of NLC were successfully prepared by melt-emulsification technique using Crodamol <span class="gene">SS</span> as the solid lipid, Miglyol 812N as the liquid oil, and soybean phosphatidylcholine (SbPC) as the emulsifier. Properties of NLC such as the particle size and its distribution, the transmission electron microscope (TEM), drug entrapment <span class="trait">efficiency</span> (EE), and drug release behavior were investigated, respectively. The Germacrone blood concentration after intravenous administration of ZTO-NLC was determined and compared with that of ZTO-injection. RESULT: As a result, the drug EEs were improved by adding the liquid lipid into the solid lipid of nanoparticles (SLNs). In vitro drug release experiments indicated that the prepared NLC could enhance the drug release rate over the SLN, and the drug release rate could be adjusted by the liquid lipid content in lipid nanospheres. X-ray and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that imperfect crystallization occurred in the inner core of the NLC particles. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the presented NLC system might be a promising intravenous dosage form of water-insoluble oily drugs.

						The majority of terrestrial plants, including many important crops such as rice, wheat, soybean, and potato, are classified as C(3) plants that assimilate atmospheric CO(2) directly through the C(3) photosynthetic pathway. C(4) plants, such as maize and sugarcane, evolved from C(3) plants, acquiring the C(4) photosynthetic pathway in addition to the C(3) pathway to achieve high photosynthetic performance and high <span class="trait">water-</span> and nitrogen-use efficiencies. Consequently, the transfer of C(4) traits to C(3) plants is one strategy being adopted for improving the photosynthetic performance of C(3) plants. The recent application of recombinant DNA technology has made considerable progress in the molecular engineering of photosynthetic genes in the past ten years. It has deepened understanding of the evolutionary scenario of the C(4) photosynthetic genes. The strategy, based on the evolutionary scenario, has enabled enzymes involved in the C(4) pathway to be expressed at high levels and in desired locations in the leaves of C(3) plants. Although overproduction of a single C(4) enzyme can alter the carbon metabolism of C(3) plants, it does not show any positive effects on photosynthesis. Transgenic C(3) plants overproducing multiple enzymes are now being produced for improving the photosynthetic performance of C(3) plants.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The aim of this study is to investigate whether exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) could modulate the photosynthetic capacity of soybean seedlings in <span class="trait">water</span> stress tolerance, and to clarify the potential functions of terminal oxidase (plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) and alternative oxidase (AOX)) in SA' s regulation on photosynthesis. The effects of SA and <span class="trait">water</span> stress on gas exchange, pigment contents, chlorophyll fluorescence, enzymes (guaiacol peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7), superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11) and NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH; EC1.1.1.82)) activity and transcript levels of PTOX, AOX1, AOX2a, AOX2b were examined in a hydroponic cultivation system. Results indicate that <span class="trait">water</span> stress significantly decreased the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (E), pigment contents (Chla + b, Chla/b, Car), maximum quantum <span class="trait">yield</span> of PSⅡphotochemistry (Fv/Fm), <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of excitation capture of open PSⅡcenter (Fv'/Fm'), quantum <span class="trait">efficiency</span> of PSⅡphotochemistry (ΦPSⅡ), photochemical quenching (qP), and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the activity of all the enzymes. SA pretreatment led to significant decreases in Ci and MDA content, and increases in Pn, Gs, E, pigment contents, Fv/Fm, Fv'/Fm', ΦPSⅡ, qP, and the activity of all the enzymes. SA treatment and <span class="trait">water</span> stress alone significantly up-regulated the expression of PTOX, <span class="gene">AOX1</span> and AOX2b. SA pretreatment further increased the transcript levels of PTOX and AOX2b of soybean seedling under <span class="trait">water</span> stress. These results indicate that SA application alleviates the <span class="trait">water</span> stress-induced decrease in photosynthesis may mainly through maintaining a lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, a greater PSⅡefficiency, and an enhanced alternative respiration and chlororespiration. PTOX and AOX may play important roles in SA-mediated <span class="trait">resistance</span> to <span class="trait">water</span> stress.

						Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the major crops worldwide and flooding stress affects the production and expansion of cultivated areas. Oxygen is essential for mitochondrial aerobic respiration to supply the energy demand of plant cells.

Both these genes are also induced by heat, cold, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and salinity stress, and up-regulate ABA receptor <span class="gene">GmPYL21</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma13g30210</span> [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref063" ref-type="bibr"> 63 </xref> ]) [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref061" ref-type="bibr"> 61 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref062" ref-type="bibr"> 62 </xref> ]. <span class="gene">GmPYL14</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma14g06100,</span> up-regulated by <span class="gene">GmDREB2A;2</span> [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref062" ref-type="bibr"> 62 </xref> ]), and <span class="gene">GmPYL21</span> were up-regulated under hypoxia (&#x0003e;9 and &#x0003e;3 fc after 4h, respectively). These receptors interact with the phosphatase <span class="gene">GmPP2C1</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma13g16640,</span> at most 3 fc under hypoxia), inhibiting it in an ABA independent manner [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref063" ref-type="bibr"> 63 </xref> ]. Interestingly, Kidokoro et al. [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref061" ref-type="bibr"> 61 </xref> ] observed that transcriptional activation of <span class="gene">GmPYL21</span> by <span class="gene">GmDREB1B;1</span> can enhance ABRE-mediated gene expression in an ABA-independent manner under cold stress, although ABA levels are not increased under such condition. We propose that ABRE-mediated gene expression is ABA-independent in hypoxic soybean roots. Although exogenous application of ABA improves flooding tolerance of plants [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref064" ref-type="bibr"> 64 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref066" ref-type="bibr"> 66 </xref> ], endogenous ABA decreases in roots under flooding stress [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref067" ref-type="bibr"> 67 </xref> &#x02013; <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref069" ref-type="bibr"> 69 </xref> ]. We observed down-regulation of genes related to ABA biosynthesis <span class="gene">(Glyma19g06540,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma06g08944,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma13g27220,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma11g21160,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma14g04950)</span> and up-regulation of ABA inactivation genes <span class="gene">GmCYP707As</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma16g20490,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma01g35660,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma09g35250</span> [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref070" ref-type="bibr"> 70 </xref> ]). In addition to <span class="gene">GmCYP707As,</span> hypoxia changes expression of soybean orthologs of <italic> A </italic> . <italic> thaliana </italic> genes involved in ABA signaling (ABA receptors Pyl4-6; phosphatases ABI1-2, HAB1-2, HAI1-3, and AHG3; AFP1-4; MAPKKK18) dependent on SRK2D/E/I (SNF1-related kinases SRK2D/SnRK2.2, SRK2E/SnRK2.6, and SRK2I/SnRK2.3) (Genevestigator microarray database [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref071" ref-type="bibr"> 71 </xref> ]) ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187920.s004"> S3 File </xref> ). SRK2D/E/I are key activators of AREB/ABF proteins [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref072" ref-type="bibr"> 72 </xref> ]. <span class="gene">Glyma01g39020,</span> which is most similar in amino acid sequence to SRK2D/E/I, is up-regulated 2- and 3-fold after 4 and 28h of hypoxia. Moreover, orthologous genes of CIPK-6 and CIPK-25 <span class="gene">(Glyma17g08270,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma04g06520,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma06g06550)</span> were up-regulated at all-time points (from 4 to 40 fc) under hypoxia. These are kinases involved in Ca <sup> +2 </sup> -mediated expression of DREB1-2 and ABA signaling [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref073" ref-type="bibr"> 73 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref074" ref-type="bibr"> 74 </xref> ]. Strikingly, although ABI1-2, PP2CA, and HAI1-2 genes from <italic> A </italic> . <italic> thaliana </italic> are down-regulated under hypoxic stress, we observed strong up-regulation of soybean orthologs of <span class="gene">Glyma01g43460</span> (HAI3) transcripts at all-time points ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187920.s004"> S3 File </xref> ). These <italic> A </italic> . <italic> thaliana </italic> genes are up-regulated under <span class="trait">drought,</span> osmotic, and salinity stresses ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187920.s004"> S3 File </xref> ) and soybean genes under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref018" ref-type="bibr"> 18 </xref> ], stresses associated with ABA production. In agreement with a role for AREB in tolerance of diverse abiotic stresses, our results indicate although ABA level decreases in soybean roots under hypoxia, ABRE-mediated gene expression may occur. In this context, AREB/ABF are powerful candidates to improve flooding tolerance.

						Differential expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) also occur in soybean leaf under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, with more aaRS DEGs in wild-type than in transgenic lines overexpressing BiP chaperone [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref094" ref-type="bibr"> 94 </xref> ]. The BiP (Binding Protein) major regulates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref095" ref-type="bibr"> 95 </xref> ]. Here, many ER stress related genes [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref096" ref-type="bibr"> 96 </xref> ] were differentially expressed ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0187920.s006"> S5 File </xref> ), including down-regulation of BiP <span class="gene">(Glyma05g36600,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma05g36620,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma08g02940,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma08g02960;</span> from -2 to -10 fc after 4 and 28h in both cultivars under hypoxia). Among these aaRS differentially expressed, <span class="gene">Glyma14g11711</span> (aspartyl-tRNA synthetase) was up-regulated at all-time points in the two cultivars (from 5 to 16 fc). Curiously, transgenic plants overexpressing an aspartyl tRNA synthase (AspRS) orthologue (At4g31180) improve tolerance to biotic stress [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref097" ref-type="bibr"> 97 </xref> ]. The At4g31180 is target of a synthetic isomer of GABA, called BABA (&#x003b2;-Amino Butyric Acid) [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref097" ref-type="bibr"> 97 </xref> ]. BABA primes plants to enhance tolerance against broad-spectrum of biotic and abiotic stresses [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref098" ref-type="bibr"> 98 </xref> ]. Inhibition of AspRS activity by BABA accumulates uncharged tRNA Asp, which as others uncharged tRNAs is signaling molecule to attenuate translation by Gcn2-eIF2&#x003b1; system, and subsequently alleviate ER stress [ <xref rid="pone.0187920.ref099" ref-type="bibr"> 99 </xref> ]. Based on this, further studies may help to elucidate involvement of amino acids metabolism in tRNA modifications, translation accuracy/efficiency, and ER stress under hypoxia. In addition, BiP and aaRS are candidates for biotechnology applications for improvement in flooding tolerance.

						Since particle size exerts significant influence on the performance of liposomes both in vitro and in vivo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-6-965"> 30 </xref> we first studied the effects of several factors on the particle size and distribution. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> Figure 1A </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> 1C </xref> , SPC/SDC liposomes before homogenization was typically 1 micron in size and exhibited wide size distribution. The particle size and polydispersity index (PI) was dramatically reduced after homogenization, and the lowest diameter (around 80 nm) of liposomes could be achieved when the homogenization pressure increased to 100 <span class="gene">bar</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> Figure 1B </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> 1C </xref> ). Although the particle size dropped dramatically, there was no worry about phasing-out of CyA. Due to its lipophilic nature and high affinity with the lipid bilayer, CyA would readily associate with the lipid and maintain a &#x0201c;solubilized&#x0201d; state. Both the TEM observation and entrapment <span class="trait">efficiency</span> measurement shown below confirmed the itnegrity of the liposomal structure. However, the particle size and PI were significantly increased ( <italic> P </italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) when we further increased the homogenization pressure to 200 bar. Rupture and aggregation of the vesicle under large shearing force of homogenization could be employed to interpret this phenomenon. In addition, no significant variation in particle size could be observed at homogenization cycles of more than 5 and the homogenization pressure at 100 <span class="gene">bar</span> ( <italic> P </italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> Figure 1D </xref> ). Nevertheless, the lowest PI could be achieved when we increase the cycles of homogenization to 20, and rupture and aggregation might occur after 25 times of homogenization, which resulted in increased PI ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-6-965"> Figure 1D </xref> ). Thus we chose a homogenization pressure of either 100 <span class="gene">bar</span> or 200 <span class="gene">bar</span> to prepare SPC/SDC liposomes for the following investigation. We chose 300 <span class="gene">bar</span> and 20 cycles to homogenize SPC/Chol liposomes, however, which were less flexible, so as to obtain similar mean particle size as SPC/SDC liposomes. Moreover, the micron-scale liposomes might have a multilamellar structure that is common for liposomes produced by the thin-film dispersion method. Further homogenization possibly produced unilamellar liposomes due to the typically small particle size of less than 100 nm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-6-965"> 31 </xref> Although energy input increased with the increase of homogenization pressure and the number of homogenization cycles, the particle size could not be reduced further because of the significantly increased surface tension. Further reduction in particle size may possibly be achieved through monitoring the composition of the lipids. We did not <span class="trait">use</span> extremely small sized particles, which would not favor uptake by the intestinal lymphatic system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-6-965"> 32 </xref>

						Given that an increase in surface area results in an increase in free energy, the stability of drug nanosuspensions is a very challenging issue during pharmaceutical product development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-8-3119"> 3 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijn-8-3119"> 8 </xref> An ideal way of addressing this problem is to convert the nanosuspension into a solid form. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijn-8-3119"> 10 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-8-3119"> 13 </xref> Therefore, in this study, we solidified the drug nanosuspensions using an easily scalable fluid-bed coating technology ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-8-3119"> Figure 1 </xref> ).
