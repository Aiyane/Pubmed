					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The complex genetic architecture of quality traits has hindered efforts to modify seed nutrients in soybean (Glycine max). Genome-wide association studies were conducted for the seed composition including protein, <span class="trait">oil,</span> fatty acids and amino acids using 313 diverse soybean germplasm accessions genotyped with a high-density SNP array. A total of 87 chromosomal regions were identified to be associated with seed composition, explaining 8-89% of genetic variances. The candidate genes <span class="gene">GmSAT1,</span> AK-HSDH, <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> and <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> of known function, and putative MtN21 nodulin, FATB and steroid-5-α-reductase involved in N2 fixation, amino acid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism were found at the major-effect loci. Further analysis of additional germplasm accessions indicated that these major-effect loci had been subjected to domestication or modern breeding selection, and the allelic variants and distributions were relevant to geographic regions. This study also revealed that amino acid concentrations related to seed weight and to total protein had different genetic basis. It helps uncover the in-depth genetic mechanism of the intricate relationships among the seed compounds. This study not only provides valuable genes and markers for soybean nutrient improvement both quantitatively and qualitatively, but also offers insights into the alteration of soybean quality during domestication and breeding.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is the world's most important leguminous crop producing high-quality protein and <span class="trait">oil.</span> Elevating <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation in soybean seed is always many researchers' goal. WRINKLED1 (WRI1) encodes a transcription factor of the APETALA2/ethylene responsive element-binding protein (AP2/EREBP) family that plays important roles during plant seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation. In this study, we isolated and characterized three distinct orthologues of <span class="gene">WRI1</span> in soybean (Glycine max) that display different organ-specific expression patterns, among which <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> was highly expressed in maturing soybean seed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that the <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> protein was capable of binding to AW-box, a conserved sequence in the proximal upstream regions of many genes involved in various steps of <span class="trait">oil</span> biosynthesis. Transgenic soybean seeds overexpressing <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> under the control of the seed-specific napin promoter showed the increased total <span class="trait">oil</span> and fatty acid content and the changed fatty acid composition. Furthermore, basing on the activated expressions in transgenic soybean seeds and existence of AW-box element in the promoter regions, direct downstream genes of <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> were identified, and their products were responsible for fatty acid production, elongation, desaturation and export from plastid. We conclude that <span class="gene">GmWRI1a</span> transcription factor can positively regulate <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation in soybean seed by a complex gene expression network related to fatty acid biosynthesis.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Nonomuraea dietziae is a promising microorganism to mediate the region-specific monooxygenation reaction of cyclosporine A (CsA). The main product [(4'-OH)MeLeu]4-CsA possesses <span class="trait">high</span> anti-HIV/HCV and hair growth-stimulating activities while avoiding the immunosuppressive effect of CsA. However, the low conversion efficiency restricts the clinical application. In this study, the production of [(4'-OH)MeLeu]4-CsA was greatly improved by 55.6% from 182.8 to 284.4 mg/L when supplementing soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> into the production medium, which represented the highest production of [(4'-OH)MeLeu]4-CsA so far. RESULTS: To investigate the effect of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> on CsA conversion, some other plant oils (corn <span class="trait">oil</span> and peanut <span class="trait">oil)</span> and the major hydrolysates of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> were fed into the production medium, respectively. The results demonstrated that the plant oils, rather than the hydrolysates, could significantly improve the [(4'-OH)MeLeu]4-CsA production, suggesting that soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> might not play its role in the lipid metabolic pathway. To further unveil the mechanism of [(4'-OH)MeLeu]4-CsA overproduction under the soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> condition, a proteomic analysis based on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was implemented. The results showed that central carbon metabolism, genetic information processing and energy metabolism were significantly up-regulated under the soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> condition. Moreover, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis indicated that soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> had a great effect on amino acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, the transcription levels of cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> hydroxylase (CYP) genes for CsA conversion were determined by RT-qPCR and the results showed that most of the CYP genes were up-regulated under the soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> could strengthen the primary metabolism and the CYP system to enhance the mycelium growth and the monooxygenation reaction, respectively, and it will be a guidance for the further metabolic engineering of this strain.

						KEY MESSAGE: We constructed a high-density linkage map comprising 3541 markers developed by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing, and identified 26 stable QTL including nine novel loci, for fatty acid composition in soybean. Soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> quality and stability are mainly determined by the fatty acid composition of the seed. In the present study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using 200 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between cultivated soybean varieties Luheidou2 and Nanhuizao, and SNP markers developed by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). This map comprises 3541 markers on 20 linkage groups and spans a genetic distance of 2534.42 cM, with an average distance of 0.72 cM between adjacent markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping revealed 26 stable QTL for five fatty acids, explaining 0.4-37.0% of the phenotypic variance for individual fatty acids across environments. Of these QTL, nine are novel loci (qLA1, qLNA2_1, qPA4_1, qLA4_1, qPA6_1, qSA12_1, qPA16_1, qOA18_1, and qFA19_1). These stable QTL harbor three fatty acid biosynthesis genes <span class="gene">(GmFabG,</span> <span class="gene">GmACP,</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD8),</span> and 66 genes encoding lipid-related transcription factors. These stable QTL and tightly linked SNP markers can be used for marker-assisted selection in soybean breeding programs.

						Soybean seed <span class="trait">oil</span> typically contains 18-20% oleic acid. Increasing the content of oleic acid is beneficial for health and biodiesel production. Mutations in <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes have been reported to increase seed oleic acid content. A subset of 1,037 mutant families from a mutagenized soybean cultivar (cv.) Forrest population was screened using reverse genetics (TILLING) to identify mutations within <span class="gene">FAD2</span> genes. Although no fad2 mutants were identified using gel-based TILLING, four fad2-1A and one fad2-1B mutants were identified to have <span class="trait">high</span> seed oleic acid content using forward genetic screening and subsequent target sequencing. TILLING has been successfully used as a non-transgenic reverse genetic approach to identify mutations in genes controlling important agronomic traits. However, this technique presents limitations in traits such as <span class="trait">oil</span> composition due to gene copy number and similarities within the soybean genome. In soybean, <span class="gene">FAD2</span> are present as two copies, <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FAD2-2. Two <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> members: <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and FAD2-1B; and three <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> members: FAD2-2A, FAD2-2B, and FAD2-2C have been reported. Syntenic, phylogenetic, and in silico analysis revealed two additional members constituting the <span class="gene">FAD2</span> gene family: <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2D</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2E,</span> located on chromosomes 09 and 15, respectively. They are presumed to have diverged from other <span class="gene">FAD2-2</span> members localized on chromosomes 19 <span class="gene">(GmFAD2-2A</span> and <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2B)</span> and 03 <span class="gene">(GmFAD2-2C).</span> This work discusses alternative solutions to the limitations of gel-based TILLING in functional genomics due to <span class="trait">high</span> copy number and multiple paralogs of the <span class="gene">FAD2</span> gene family in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed <span class="trait">oil</span> is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (Glycine max) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed <span class="trait">oil</span> biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <span class="gene">GmZF351,</span> encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> facilitates <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation by directly activating WRINKLED1, BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2, 3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III, DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1, and OLEOSIN2 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation. The ZF351 haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (Glycine soja) subgroup III correlates well with <span class="trait">high</span> gene expression level, seed <span class="trait">oil</span> contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> expression leads to increased seed <span class="trait">oil</span> content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation, and the manipulation of <span class="gene">GmZF351</span> may have great potential in the improvement of <span class="trait">oil</span> production in soybean and other related crops.

						OBJECTIVE: The fractionated coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> based Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) of Acyclovir (ACV) were fabricated in two batches by using Glyceryl mono stearate <span class="gene">(GMS)</span> and Lipoid S75 (Fat free soybean phospholipids with 70% phosphatidylcholine-Lipoid <span class="gene">GmbH,</span> Germany). The research was focused on developing ACV-SLN by using <span class="trait">high</span> pressure hot-homogenization technique. The ingredients were used in different concentrations and ratios to identify the best formulation design. METHODS: The <span class="gene">GMS</span> with Fractionated coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> and Lipoid S75 with Fractionated coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> were used in various concentrations in formulation design to assess the impact on the fabrication and evaluation of SLNs. The SLNs were subjected to various characterization techniques such as XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared study), master sizer analysis and zeta potential. The mean particle size was determined by master sizer and zeta sizer. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used as a tool to analyze the morphology and other features. The zeta potential and drug Entrapment Efficiency (EE%) were also determined. The drug release time profile was studied in vitro study with the utilization of dialysis membrane technique as well as by wistar rat skin. The most recent patents related to the current research topic were also discussed. RESULTS: The Zeta potential of the best formulation from <span class="gene">GMS</span> batch GNE5 was found to be -2.62mV as the preparation was very viscous with low zeta potential. The better results of Lipoid S75 batch LS4 were found to be 23.23mV which was within the recommended range. The formulations prepared with Lipoid S75, LS4 showed narrow distribution size of 53.46nm and the uniformity was found to be 14.1. The formulation LS4 demonstrated the lowest distribution with of 6.8, 14.5, 139.1nm respectively amongst all the formulations. CONCLUSION: SLN dispersions exhibited the average size in nano range. SLNs with small particle size found to have predetermined encapsulation efficiency and relatively <span class="trait">high</span> loading capacity and predetermined in vitro drugrelease profile. The lipoid S and Pluronic F68 nanoparticles are found to be superior to Conventional <span class="gene">GMSand</span> tween 80 nanoparticles in terms of particles size, stability and zetapotential.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: The ability to modulate levels of individual fatty acids within soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> has potential to increase shelf-life and frying stability and to improve nutritional characteristics. Commodity soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> contains <span class="trait">high</span> levels of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid, which contribute to oxidative instability - a problem that has been addressed through partial hydrogenation. However, partial hydrogenation increases levels of trans-fatty acids, which have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Previously, we generated soybean lines with knockout mutations within fatty acid desaturase 2-1A (FAD2-1A) and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes, resulting in <span class="trait">oil</span> with increased levels of monounsaturated oleic acid (18:1) and decreased levels of linoleic (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3). Here, we stack mutations within <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> with mutations in fatty acid desaturase 3A (FAD3A) to further decrease levels of linolenic acid. Mutations were introduced into <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> by directly delivering TALENs into fad2-1a fad2-1b soybean plants. RESULTS: <span class="trait">Oil</span> from fad2-1a fad2-1b fad3a plants had significantly lower levels of linolenic acid (2.5 %), as compared to fad2-1a fad2-1b plants (4.7 %). Furthermore, <span class="trait">oil</span> had significantly lower levels of linoleic acid (2.7 % compared to 5.1 %) and significantly higher levels of oleic acid (82.2 % compared to 77.5 %). Transgene-free fad2-1a fad2-1b fad3a soybean lines were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented here provide an efficient means for using sequence-specific nucleases to stack quality traits in soybean. The resulting product comprised oleic acid levels above 80 % and linoleic and linolenic acid levels below 3 %.

						Kinetically improved diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) variants were created to favorably alter carbon partitioning in soybean (Glycine max) seeds. Initially, variants of a type 1 <span class="gene">DGAT</span> from a high-oil, high-oleic acid plant seed, Corylus americana, were screened for <span class="trait">high</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> content in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nearly all <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants examined from high-oil strains had increased affinity for oleoyl-CoA, with S0.5 values decreased as much as 4.7-fold compared with the wild-type value of 0.94 µm Improved soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants were then designed to include amino acid substitutions observed in promising C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants. The expression of soybean and C. americana <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variants in soybean somatic embryos resulted in <span class="trait">oil</span> contents as <span class="trait">high</span> as 10% and 12%, respectively, compared with only 5% and 7.6% <span class="trait">oil</span> achieved by overexpressing the corresponding wild-type DGATs. The affinity for oleoyl-CoA correlated strongly with <span class="trait">oil</span> content. The soybean <span class="gene">DGAT</span> variant that gave the greatest <span class="trait">oil</span> increase contained 14 amino acid substitutions out of a total of 504 (97% sequence identity with native). Seed-preferred expression of this soybean <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> variant increased <span class="trait">oil</span> content of soybean seeds by an average of 3% (16% relative increase) in highly replicated, single-location field trials. The <span class="gene">DGAT</span> transgenes significantly reduced the soluble carbohydrate content of mature seeds and increased the seed protein content of some events. This study demonstrated that engineering of the native <span class="gene">DGAT</span> enzyme is an effective strategy to improve the <span class="trait">oil</span> content and value of soybeans.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed oils provide a renewable source of food, biofuel and industrial raw materials that is important for humans. Although many genes and pathways for acyl-lipid metabolism have been identified, little is known about whether there is a specific mechanism for high-oil content in high-oil plants. Based on the distinct differences in seed <span class="trait">oil</span> content between four high-oil dicots (20~50%) and three low-oil grasses (&lt;3%), comparative genome, transcriptome and differential expression analyses were used to investigate this mechanism. Among 4,051 dicot-specific soybean genes identified from 252,443 genes in the seven species, 54 genes were shown to directly participate in acyl-lipid metabolism, and 93 genes were found to be associated with acyl-lipid metabolism. Among the 93 dicot-specific genes, 42 and 27 genes, including CBM20-like SBDs and GPT2, participate in carbohydrate degradation and transport, respectively. 40 genes highly up-regulated during seed <span class="trait">oil</span> rapid accumulation period are mainly involved in initial fatty acid synthesis, triacylglyceride assembly and oil-body formation, for example, ACCase, PP, DGAT1, PDAT1, OLEs and STEROs, which were also found to be differentially expressed between <span class="trait">high-</span> and low-oil soybean accessions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct differences of oleosin in patterns of gene duplication and loss between high-oil dicots and low-oil grasses. In addition, seed-specific <span class="gene">GmGRF5,</span> ABI5 and <span class="gene">GmTZF4</span> were predicted to be candidate regulators in seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation. This study facilitates future research on lipid biosynthesis and potential genetic improvement of seed <span class="trait">oil</span> content.

						<span class="trait">High</span> levels of linolenic acid (80 g kg(-1)) are associated with the development of off-flavors and poor stability in soybean <span class="trait">oil.</span> The development of low linolenic acid lines such as RG10 (20 g kg(-1) linolenic acid) can reduce these problems. The level of linolenic acid in seed <span class="trait">oil</span> is determined by the activities of microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturases (FAD3). A major linolenic acid QTL (&gt;70% of variation) on linkage group B2 (chromosome <span class="gene">Gm14)</span> was previously detected in a recombinant inbred line population from the RG10 × OX948 cross. The objectives of this study were to validate the major linolenic acid QTL in an independent population and characterize all the soybean <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes. Four <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes were sequenced and localized in RG10 and OX948 and compared to the genes in the reference Williams 82 genome. The <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> gene sequences mapped to the locus <span class="gene">Glyma.14g194300</span> [on the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm14</span> (B2)], which is syntenic to the <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.02g227200)</span> on the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm02</span> (D1b). The location of the <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> gene is the same as was previously determined for the fan allele, that conditions low linolenic acid content and several linolenic acid QTL, including Linolen 3-3, mapped previously with the RG10 × OX948 population and confirmed in the PI 361088B × OX948 population as Linolen-PO (FAD3A). The <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene-based marker, developed previously, was mapped to the chromosome <span class="gene">Gm02</span> (D1b) in a region containing a newly detected linolenic acid QTL [Linolen-RO(FAD3B)] in the RG10 × OX948 genetic map and corresponds well with the in silico position of the <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> gene sequences. <span class="gene">FAD3C</span> and <span class="gene">FAD3D</span> gene sequences, mapped to syntenic regions on chromosomes <span class="gene">Gm18</span> (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.18g062000)</span> and <span class="gene">Gm11</span> (locus <span class="gene">Glyma.11g227200),</span> respectively. Association of linolenic acid QTL with the desaturase genes <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> and FAD3B, their validation in an independent population, and development of <span class="gene">FAD3</span> gene-specific markers should simplify and accelerate breeding for low linolenic acid soybean cultivars.

						Phosphorus (P) is essential for all living cells and organisms, and low-P stress represents a major constraint on plant growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> worldwide. Soybean is an important economical resource of protein and <span class="trait">oil</span> for human and animals, and soybean is also a high-P demand species that is sensitive to low-P stress, which is considered a major constraint on soybean production. However, P efficiency is an important complex quantitative trait involving multiple genes, and the mechanisms underlying soybean P efficiency are largely unknown. Here, we reported the construction of a high-density genetic map using a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) strategy in soybean. This map, spanning 3020.59 cM in length, contained 6159 markers on 20 chromosomes, with an average distance of 0.49 cM between adjacent markers. Based on this map, 20 loci, including eight novel loci, associated with P efficiency-related traits were identified across multiple years and treatments. The confidence intervals of almost all QTLs were refined significantly, and the accuracy of this map was evidenced by coincident detections of the previously identified P efficiency-related genes <span class="gene">GmACP1</span> and <span class="gene">GmPT1.</span> Notably, a highly significant novel QTL located on chromosome 4, q4-2, was identified across traits, years and treatments. Several candidate genes, such as a pectin methylesterase-encoding gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.04G214000)</span> and a protein kinase gene <span class="gene">(Glyma.13G161900),</span> with significantly differential expression upon low-P stress were considered as promising candidates involved in regulating soybean P efficiency. Markers that tightly associated with P efficiency could be used for marker-assisted selection in a soybean P efficient breeding program. Further, dissection of these QTLs will facilitate gene cloning underlying P efficiency in soybean, and increase our understanding of efficient use of P in enhancing crop <span class="trait">yield.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The obesity epidemic in the U.S. has led to extensive research into potential contributing dietary factors, especially fat and fructose. Recently, increased consumption of soybean <span class="trait">oil,</span> which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately <span class="trait">high</span> in fat from coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> and soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin <span class="trait">resistance</span> compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the <span class="trait">high</span> fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut <span class="trait">oil</span> diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet <span class="trait">high</span> in soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet <span class="trait">high</span> in fructose or coconut <span class="trait">oil.</span>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed oils have proved recalcitrant to modification for the production of industrially useful lipids. Here, we demonstrate the successful metabolic engineering and subsequent field production of an oilseed crop with the highest accumulation of unusual <span class="trait">oil</span> achieved so far in transgenic plants. Previously, expression of the Euonymus alatus diacylglycerol acetyltransferase (EaDAcT) gene in wild-type Arabidopsis seeds resulted in the accumulation of 45 mol% of unusual 3-acetyl-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerols (acetyl-TAGs) in the seed <span class="trait">oil</span> (Durrett et al., 2010 PNAS 107:9464). Expression of EaDAcT in dgat1 mutants compromised in their ability to synthesize regular triacylglycerols increased acetyl-TAGs to 65 mol%. Camelina and soybean transformed with the EaDAcT gene accumulate acetyl-triacylglycerols (acetyl-TAGs) at up to 70 mol% of seed <span class="trait">oil.</span> A similar strategy of coexpression of EaDAcT together with RNAi suppression of <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> increased acetyl-TAG levels to up to 85 mol% in field-grown transgenic Camelina. Additionally, total moles of triacylglycerol (TAG) per seed increased 20%. Analysis of the acetyl-TAG fraction revealed a twofold reduction in very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), consistent with their displacement from the sn-3 position by acetate. Seed germination remained <span class="trait">high,</span> and seedlings were able to metabolize the stored acetyl-TAGs as rapidly as regular triacylglycerols. Viscosity, freezing point and caloric content of the Camelina acetyl-TAG oils were reduced, enabling use of this <span class="trait">oil</span> in several nonfood and food applications.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> is <span class="trait">high</span> in polyunsaturated fats and is often partially hydrogenated to increase its shelf life and improve oxidative stability. The trans-fatty acids produced through hydrogenation pose a health threat. Soybean lines that are low in polyunsaturated fats were generated by introducing mutations in two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B), which in the seed convert the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, to the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to recognize and cleave conserved DNA sequences in both genes. In four of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the TALENs, mutations in <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were observed in DNA extracted from leaf tissue; three of the four lines transmitted heritable <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> mutations to the next generation. The fatty acid profile of the seed was dramatically changed in plants homozygous for mutations in both <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and FAD2-1B: oleic acid increased from 20% to 80% and linoleic acid decreased from 50% to under 4%. Further, mutant plants were identified that lacked the TALEN transgene and only carried the targeted mutations. The ability to create a valuable trait in a single generation through targeted modification of a gene family demonstrates the power of TALENs for genome engineering and crop improvement.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> has a wide variety of uses, and stearic acid, which is a relatively minor component of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> is increasingly desired for both industrial and food applications. New soybean mutants containing <span class="trait">high</span> levels of the saturated fatty acid stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate content from 6-14% stearic acid, which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type seed of the Williams 82 cultivar. Candidate gene sequencing revealed that all of these lines carried amino acid substitutions in the gene encoding the delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase enzyme (SACPD-C) required for the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid. Five of these missense mutations were in highly conserved residues clustered around the predicted di-iron center of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> enzyme. Co-segregation analysis demonstrated a positive association of the elevated stearate trait with the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutation for three populations. These missense mutations may provide additional alleles that may be used in the development of new soybean cultivars with increased levels of stearic acid.

						BACKGROUND: Variation in seed <span class="trait">oil</span> composition and content among soybean varieties is largely attributed to differences in transcript sequences and/or transcript accumulation of <span class="trait">oil</span> production related genes in seeds. Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> quality improvement. RESULTS: In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in <span class="trait">oil</span> composition and/or total <span class="trait">oil</span> content. Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its <span class="trait">high</span> effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered <span class="trait">oil</span> quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> quality.

						Improving the quality and performance of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> as biodiesel depends on the chemical composition of its fatty acids and requires an increase in monounsaturated acids and a reduction in polyunsaturated acids. Despite its current use as a source of biofuel, soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> contains an average of 25 % oleic acid and 13 % palmitic acid, which negatively impacts its oxidative stability and freezing point, causing a <span class="trait">high</span> rate of nitrogen oxide emission. Gas chromatography and ion mobility mass spectrometry were conducted on soybean fatty acids from metabolically engineered seed extracts to determine the nature of the structural oleic and palmitic acids. The soybean genes <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> and FatB were placed under the control of the 35SCaMV constitutive promoter, introduced to soybean embryonic axes by particle bombardment and down-regulated using RNA interference technology. Results indicate that the metabolically engineered plants exhibited a significant increase in oleic acid (up to 94.58 %) and a reduction in palmitic acid (to &lt;3 %) in their seed <span class="trait">oil</span> content. No structural differences were observed between the fatty acids of the transgenic and non-transgenic <span class="trait">oil</span> extracts.

						KEY MESSAGE: Two new sources of elevated seed stearic acid were identified and the feasibility of an elevated stearic acid, <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid germplasm was studied. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] <span class="trait">oil</span> typically contains 2-4% stearic acid. <span class="trait">Oil</span> with at least 20% stearic acid is desirable because of its improved baking properties and health profile. This study identifies two new sources of <span class="trait">high</span> stearic acid and evaluates the interaction of <span class="trait">high</span> stearic and oleic acid alleles. TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755, <span class="trait">high</span> stearic acid 'Holladay' mutants, were crossed to FAM94-41-3, a line containing a point mutation in a seed-specific isoform of a Δ9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (SACPD-C). F2-derived lines were evaluated for fatty acid content in four field environments. Sequencing of SACPDs in TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755 revealed distinct deletions of at least one megabase encompassing <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> in both lines. After genotyping, the additive effect for stearic acid was estimated at +1.8% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> point mutation and +4.1% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletions. Average stearic acid in lines homozygous for the deletions was 12.2%. A FAM94-41-3-derived line and TCHM08-1087-11, a selection from TCHM08-1087, were crossed to S09-2902-145, a line containing missense mutations in two fatty acid desaturases (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). F1 plants were grown in a greenhouse and individual F2 seed were genotyped and phenotyped. No interaction was observed between either <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> or <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> and any of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutant alleles. Seed homozygous mutant for SACPD-C/FAD2-1A/FAD2-1B contained 12.7% stearic acid and 65.5% oleic acid while seed homozygous for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion and mutant for <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> averaged 10.4% stearic acid and 75.9% oleic acid.

						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seed <span class="trait">oil</span> is the primary global source of edible <span class="trait">oil</span> and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, increasing the relative <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration in soybean is desirable; however, that goal is complex due to the quantitative nature of the <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration trait and possible effects on major agronomic traits such as seed <span class="trait">yield</span> or protein concentration. The objectives of the present study were to study the relationship between seed <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration and important agronomic and seed quality traits, including seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> 100-seed weight, protein concentration, plant height, and days to maturity, and to identify <span class="trait">oil</span> quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are co-localized with the traits evaluated. A population of 203 F4:6 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between moderately <span class="trait">high</span> <span class="trait">oil</span> soybean genotypes OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe, was developed and grown across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. Among the 11 QTL associated with seed <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration in the population, which were detected using either single-factor ANOVA or multiple QTL mapping methods, the number of QTL that were co-localized with other important traits QTL were six for protein concentration, four for seed <span class="trait">yield,</span> two for 100-seed weight, one for days to maturity, and one for plant height. The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with seed protein concentration. The <span class="trait">oil</span> favorable alleles of markers Satt001 and <span class="gene">GmDGAT2B</span> were positively correlated with seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> In addition, significant two-way epistatic interactions, where one of the interacting markers was solely associated with seed <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration, were identified for the selected traits in this study. The number of significant epistatic interactions was seven for <span class="trait">yield,</span> four for days to maturity, two for 100-seed weight, one for protein concentration, and one for plant height. The identified molecular markers associated with oil-related QTL in this study, which also have positive effects on other important traits such as seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and protein concentration, could be used in the soybean marker breeding programs aimed at developing either higher seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration or higher seed protein and <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration per hectare. Alternatively, selecting complementary parents with greater breeding values due to positive epistatic interactions could lead to the development of higher <span class="trait">oil</span> soybean cultivars.

						Palmitic acid is the most abundant (approx. 11% of total fatty acids) saturated fatty acid in conventional soybean seed <span class="trait">oil.</span> Increasing the saturated acid content of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> improves its oxidative stability and plasticity. We have developed three soybean mutants with <span class="trait">high</span> palmitic acid content by X-ray irradiation. In this study, we successfully identified the mutated sites of two of these high-palmitic-acid mutants, J10 and M22. PCR-based mutant analysis revealed that J10 has a 206,203-bp-long deletion that includes the <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> gene and 16 other predicted genes, and M22 has a 26-bp-long deletion in the sixth intron of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB.</span> The small deletion in M22 causes mis-splicing of <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> transcripts, which should result in nonfunctional products. In addition, we designed co-dominant marker sets for these mutant alleles and confirmed the association of genotypes and palmitic acid contents in F(2) seeds of J10 X M22. This information will be useful in breeding programs to develop novel soybean cultivars with improved palmitic acid content. However, in the third mutant, KK7, we found no polymorphism in either <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> or <span class="gene">GmKASIIB,</span> which suggests that several unknown genes in addition to <span class="gene">GmKASIIA</span> and <span class="gene">GmKASIIB</span> may be involved in elevating the palmitic acid content of soybean seed <span class="trait">oil.</span>

						<span class="trait">High</span> oleic acid soybeans were produced by combining mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. Despite having a <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid content, the linolenic acid content of these soybeans was in the range of 4-6 %, which may be <span class="trait">high</span> enough to cause oxidative instability of the <span class="trait">oil.</span> Therefore, a study was conducted to incorporate one or two mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes into the <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid background to further reduce the linolenic acid content. As a result, soybean lines with <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid and low linolenic acid (HOLL) content were produced using different sources of mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> genes. While oleic acid content of these HOLL lines was stable across two testing environments, the reduction of linolenic acid content varied depending on the number of mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes combined with mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes, on the severity of mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene, and on the testing environment. Combination of two mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> genes and one mutant <span class="gene">FAD3</span> gene resulted in less than 2 % linolenic acid content in Portageville, Missouri (MO) while four mutant genes were needed to achieve the same linolenic acid in Columbia, MO. This study generated non-transgenic soybeans with the highest oleic acid content and lowest linolenic acid content reported to date, offering a unique alternative to produce a fatty acid profile similar to olive <span class="trait">oil.</span>

						We compared the effect of the consumption of seje <span class="trait">oil</span> (Oenocarpus bataua), with that of olive <span class="trait">oil,</span> on plasma lipids and susceptibility in vitro to oxidation of <span class="trait">high</span> density lipoprotein (HDL) in the rat. Two groups often male Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum, for a lapse of eight week, with a purified diets with 10g de seje <span class="trait">oil</span> or olive oil/100 g of diet (GS y GO respectively). The animals were exsanguinated at the end of the experimental after a 14 hour fast. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation, and the fractions of lipoproteins were separated from the plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation. Rats of GO had a statistically significant lower in concentration of TG (p &lt; 0.05) compared with <span class="gene">GS</span> group. HDL fractions in both groups were oxidatively modified by incubation with copper ions. Differences in the fractions susceptibilities to peroxidation were studied by measuring the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) for 3 hours. HDL in <span class="gene">GS</span> had a statistically significant decrease in TBARS formation (p &lt; 0.05) relative to HDL of GO. This may be explained by the lower concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids of HDL in <span class="gene">GS</span> compared with HDL in GO.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant oils can be useful chemical feedstocks such as a source of epoxy fatty acids. <span class="trait">High</span> seed-specific expression of a Stokesia laevis epoxygenase (SlEPX) in soybeans only results in 3-7% epoxide levels. SlEPX-transgenic soybean seeds also exhibited other phenotypic alterations, such as altered seed fatty acid profiles, reduced <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation, and variable protein levels. SlEPX-transgenic seeds showed a 2-5% reduction in total <span class="trait">oil</span> content and protein levels of 30.9-51.4%. To address these pleiotrophic effects of SlEPX expression on other traits, transgenic soybeans were developed to co-express SlEPX and <span class="gene">DGAT</span> (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) genes (VgDGAT1 & 2) isolated from Vernonia galamensis, a <span class="trait">high</span> accumulator of epoxy fatty acids. These side effects of SlEPX expression were largely overcome in the <span class="gene">DGAT</span> co-expressing soybeans. Total <span class="trait">oil</span> and protein contents were restored to the levels in non-transgenic soybeans, indicating that both VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2 could complement the disrupted phenotypes caused by over-expression of an epoxygenase in soybean seeds.

						The alteration of fatty acid profiles in soybean to improve soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> quality has been a long-time goal of soybean researchers. Soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> with elevated oleic acid is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> compared to other oils. In the lipid biosynthetic pathway, the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) is responsible for the conversion of oleic acid precursors to linoleic acid precursors in developing soybean seeds. Two genes encoding <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> were identified to be expressed specifically in seeds during embryogenesis and have been considered to hold an important role in controlling the seed oleic acid content. A total of 22 soybean plant introduction (PI) lines identified to have an elevated oleic acid content were characterized for sequence mutations in the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genes. PI 603452 was found to contain a deletion of a nucleotide in the second exon of FAD2-1A. These important SNPs were used in developing molecular marker genotyping assays. The assays appear to be a reliable and accurate tool to identify the FAD 2-1A and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> genotype of wild-type and mutant plants. PI 603452 was subsequently crossed with PI 283327, a soybean line that has a mutation in FAD2-1B. Interestingly, soybean lines carrying both homozygous insertion/deletion mutation (indel) <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> alleles and mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles have an average of 82-86% oleic acid content, compared to 20% in conventional soybean, and low levels of linoleic and linolenic acids. The newly identified indel mutation in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene offers a simple method for the development of <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid commercial soybean varieties.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A synthetic Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) gene open reading frame (ORF) for expression in yeast was constructed, and the lycotoxin-1 (Lyt-1) <span class="gene">C3</span> variant gene ORF, potentially to improve the availability of the active enzyme at the surface of the yeast cell, was added in frame with the CALB ORF using an automated PCR assembly and DNA purification protocol on an integrated robotic workcell. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing CALB protein or CALB Lyt-1 fusion protein were first grown on 2% (w/v) glucose, producing 9.3 g/L ethanol during fermentation. The carbon source was switched to galactose for GAL1-driven expression, and the CALB and CALB Lyt-1 enzymes expressed were tested for fatty acid ethyl ester (biodiesel) production. The synthetic enzymes catalyzed the formation of fatty acid ethyl esters from ethanol and either corn or soybean <span class="trait">oil.</span> It was further demonstrated that a one-step-charging resin, specifically selected for binding to lipase, was capable of covalent attachment of the CALB Lyt-1 enzyme, and that the resin-bound enzyme catalyzed the production of biodiesel. High-level expression of lipase in an ethanologenic yeast strain has the potential to increase the profitability of an integrated biorefinery by combining bioethanol production with coproduction of a low-cost biocatalyst that converts corn <span class="trait">oil</span> to biodiesel.

						Mutagenized populations have become indispensable resources for introducing variation and studying gene function in plant genomics research. In this study, fast neutron (FN) radiation was used to induce deletion mutations in the soybean (Glycine max) genome. Approximately 120,000 soybean seeds were exposed to FN radiation doses of up to 32 Gray units to develop over 23,000 independent M2 lines. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this population for phenotypic screening and associated genomic characterization of striking and agronomically important traits. Plant variation was cataloged for seed composition, maturity, morphology, pigmentation, and nodulation traits. Mutants that showed significant increases or decreases in seed protein and <span class="trait">oil</span> content across multiple generations and environments were identified. The application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to lesion-induced mutants for deletion mapping was validated on a midoleate x-ray mutant, M23, with a known <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> (for fatty acid desaturase) gene deletion. Using CGH, a subset of mutants was characterized, revealing deletion regions and candidate genes associated with phenotypes of interest. Exome resequencing and sequencing of PCR products confirmed FN-induced deletions detected by CGH. Beyond characterization of soybean FN mutants, this study demonstrates the utility of CGH, exome sequence capture, and next-generation sequencing approaches for analyses of mutant plant genomes. We present this FN mutant soybean population as a valuable public resource for future genetic screens and functional genomics research.

						BACKGROUND: The alteration of fatty acid profiles in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to improve soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> quality is an important and evolving theme in soybean research to meet nutritional needs and industrial criteria in the modern market. Soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> with elevated oleic acid is desirable because this monounsaturated fatty acid improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of the <span class="trait">oil.</span> Commodity soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> typically contains 20% oleic acid and the target for <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> is approximately 80% of the <span class="trait">oil;</span> previous conventional plant breeding research to raise the oleic acid level to just 50-60% of the <span class="trait">oil</span> was hindered by the genetic complexity and environmental instability of the trait. The objective of this work was to create the <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid trait in soybeans by identifying and combining mutations in two delta-twelve fatty acid desaturase genes, <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and FAD2-1B. RESULTS: Three polymorphisms found in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles of two soybean lines resulted in missense mutations. For each of the two soybean lines, there was one unique amino acid change within a highly conserved region of the protein. The mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles were associated with an increase in oleic acid levels, although the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> mutant alleles alone were not capable of producing a <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid phenotype. When existing <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> mutations were combined with the novel mutant <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles, a <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid phenotype was recovered only for those lines which were homozygous for both of the mutant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to produce conventional soybean lines with 80% oleic acid in the <span class="trait">oil</span> in two different ways, each requiring the contribution of only two genes. The <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid soybean germplasm developed contained a desirable fatty acid profile, and it was stable in two production environments. The presumed causative sequence polymorphisms in the <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> alleles were developed into highly efficient molecular markers for tracking the mutant alleles. The resources described here for the creation of <span class="trait">high</span> oleic acid soybeans provide a framework to efficiently develop soybean varieties to meet changing market demands.

						Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the main storage lipid in plants. Acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1 and DGAT2) and phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) can catalyze TAG synthesis. It is unclear how these three independent genes are regulated in developing seeds, and particularly if they have specific functions in the <span class="trait">high</span> accumulation of unusual fatty acids in seed <span class="trait">oil.</span> The expression patterns of DGAT1, DGAT2 and a PDAT in relation to the accumulation of <span class="trait">oil</span> and epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids in developing seeds of the plant species Vernonia galamensis, Euphorbia lagascae, Stokesia laevis and castor that accumulate <span class="trait">high</span> levels of these fatty acids in comparison with soybean and Arabidopsis were investigated. The expression patterns of DGAT1, DGAT2 and the PDAT are consistent with all three enzymes playing a role in the <span class="trait">high</span> epoxy or hydroxy fatty acid accumulation in developing seeds of these plants. PDAT and DGAT2 transcript levels are present at much higher levels in developing seeds of epoxy and hydroxy fatty acid accumulating plants than in soybeans or Arabidopsis. Moreover, PDAT, <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> and DGAT2 are found to be expressed in many different plant tissues, suggesting that these enzymes may have other roles in addition to seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation. <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> appears to be a major enzyme for seed <span class="trait">oil</span> accumulation at least in Arabidopsis and soybeans. For the epoxy and hydroxy fatty acid accumulating plants, DGAT2 and PDAT also show expression patterns consistent with a role in the selective accumulation of these unusual fatty acids in seed <span class="trait">oil.</span>

						Vernolic acid (cis-12-epoxy-octadeca-cis-9-enoic acid) is valuable as a renewable chemical feedstock. This fatty acid can accumulate to <span class="trait">high</span> levels in the seed <span class="trait">oil</span> of some plant species such as Vernonia galamensis and Stokesia laevis which are unsuitable for large-scale production. A cost-effective alternative for production of epoxy fatty acids is to genetically engineer its biosynthesis in commercial oilseeds. An epoxygenase cDNA (SlEPX) responsible for vernolic acid synthesis and two acyl-CoA : diacylglycerol acyltransferase cDNAs (VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2) catalysing triacylglycerol (TAG) formation were cloned from developing seeds of S. laevis and V. galamensis. Co-expression of SlEPX and VgDGAT1 or VgDGAT2 greatly increases accumulation of vernolic acid both in petunia leaves and soybean somatic embryos. Seed-specific expression of VgDGAT1 and VgDGAT2 in SlEPX mature soybean seeds results in vernolic acid levels of approximately 15% and 26%. Both <span class="gene">DGAT1</span> and DGAT2 increase epoxy fatty acid accumulation with DGAT2 having much greater impact.

						Reduction of phytic acid in soybean seeds has the potential to improve the nutritional value of soybean meal and lessen phosphorus pollution in large scale animal farming. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of two new low phytic acid (LPA) mutations on seed quality and nutritional traits. Multilocation/season comparative analyses showed that the two mutations did not affect the concentration of crude protein, any of the individual amino acids, crude <span class="trait">oil,</span> and individual saturated fatty acids. Among other traits, <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-TW75-1</span> had consistently higher sucrose contents (+47.4-86.1%) and lower raffinose contents (-74.2 to -84.3%) than those of wild type (WT) parent Taiwan 75; <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> had higher total isoflavone contents (3038.8-4305.4 microg/g) than its parent Zhechun # 3 (1583.6-2644.9 microg/g) in all environments. Further tests of homozygous F(3) progenies of the cross <span class="gene">Gm-lpa-ZC-2</span> x Wuxing # 4 (WT variety) showed that LPA lines had a mean content of total isoflavone significantly higher than WT lines. This study demonstrated that two LPA mutant genes have no negative effects on seed quality and nutritional traits; they instead have the potential to improve a few other properties. Therefore, these two mutant genes are valuable genetic resources for breeding <span class="trait">high</span> quality soybean varieties.

						DP-3Ø5423-1 (305423) is a genetically-modified (GM) soybean that was produced by biolistic insertion of a gm-fad2-1 gene fragment and the gm-hra gene into the germline of soybean seeds. The gm-fad2-1 gene fragment cosuppresses expression of the endogenous <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> gene encoding the seed-specific omega-6 fatty acid desaturase resulting in higher concentrations of oleic acid (18:1) relative to linoleic acid (18:2). The gm-hra gene encoding a modified acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme was used as a selectable marker. In the current study, processed fractions (meal, hulls, and <span class="trait">oil)</span> from 305423 soybeans, non-GM soybeans with a similar genetic background (near isoline control) and three commercially-available non-GM varieties were used to formulate diets that were nutritionally comparable to PMI Certified Rodent LabDiet 5002. Diets were fed to young adult Crl:CD(SD) rats (12/sex/group) for approximately 90 days. Compared with rats fed the non-GM control diet, no biologically relevant differences were observed in rats fed the 305423 diet with respect to body weight/gain, food consumption/efficiency, mortality, clinical signs of toxicity, or ophthalmological observations. No test diet-related effects were observed on neurobehavioral assessments, organ weights, or clinical or anatomic pathology. These results demonstrated that 305423 soybeans are as safe and wholesome as non-GM soybeans.

						Alpha-linolenic acid(ALA, C18:3delta9,12,15 ) is an essential fatty acid which has many sanitary functions to human. However, its contents in diets are often not enough. In plants, omega-3 fatty acid desaturases(FAD) catalyze linoleic acid(LA, C18:2delta9,12) into ALA. The seed <span class="trait">oil</span> of Glycine max contains <span class="trait">high</span> level of ALA. To investigate the functions of Glycine max omega-3FAD, the cDNA of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C was amplified by RT-PCR from immature seeds, then cloned into the shuttle expression vector p416 to generate the recombinant vector p4GFAD3C. The resulting vector was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae K601 throuth LiAc method. The positive clones were screened on the CM(Ura-) medium and identified by PCR, and then cultured in CM (Ura-) liquid medium with exogenous LA in 20 degrees C for three days. The intracellular fatty acid composition of the engineering strain Kp416 and Kp4GFAD3C was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A novel peak in strain Kp4GFAD3C was detected,which was not detectable in control, Comparison of the retention times of the newly yielded peak with that of authentic standard indicated that the fatty acid is ALA. The content of ALA reached to 3.1% of the total fatty acid in recombinant strain, the content of LA correspondingly decreased from 22% to 16.2% by contrast. It was suggested that the protein encoded by <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> C can specifically catalyze 18 carbon PUFA substrate of LA into ALA by taking off hydrogen atoms at delta15 location. In this study, we expressed a Glycine max omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene in S. cerevisiae; An efficient and economical yeast expressing system(K601-p416 system) which is suitable for the expression of FAD was built.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase is an essential enzyme in the production of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid during the seed developing stage. We have constructed a chimeric gene consisting of a maize Ubi1-P-int and a soybean <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> cDNA, which was introduced into rice plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Ten transformants containing the chimeric gene were established and expression subsequently confirmed by Northern blotting. Furthermore, alpha-linolenic acid content of the T(1) seeds increased dramatically up to tenfold that of the control, and this phenotype was also stably inherited in the T(2) and T(3) progenies. These results demonstrate that the alpha-linolenic acid content of rice seed <span class="trait">oil</span> can easily be altered using the combination of a high-activity promoter and a <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> gene.

						Pseudomonas alcaligenes M-1 secretes an alkaline lipase, which has excellent characteristics for the removal of fatty stains under modern washing conditions. A fed-batch fermentation process based on the secretion of the alkaline lipase from P. alcaligenes was developed. Due to the inability of P. alcaligenes to grow on glucose, citric acid and soybean <span class="trait">oil</span> were applied as substrates in the batch phase and feed phase, respectively. The gene encoding the high-alkaline lipase from P. alcaligenes was isolated and characterized. Amplification of lipase gene copies in P. alcaligenes with the aid of low- and high-copy-number plasmids resulted in an increase of lipase expression that was apparently colinear with the gene copy number. It was found that overexpression of the lipase helper gene, lipB, produced a stimulating effect in strains with <span class="trait">high</span> copy numbers (&gt; 20) of the lipase structural gene, lipA. In strains with <span class="gene">lipA</span> on a low-copy-number vector, the <span class="gene">lipB</span> gene did not show any effect, suggesting that LipB is required in a low ratio to LipA only. During scaling up of the fermentation process to 100 m3, severe losses in lipase productivity were observed. Simulations have identified an increased level of dissolved carbon dioxide as the most probable cause for the scale-up losses. A large-scale fermentation protocol with a reduced dissolved carbon dioxide concentration resulted in a substantial elimination of the scale-up loss.

						&#x003b1;-Linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency and a skewed of &#x003c9;6:&#x003c9;3 fatty acid ratio in the diet are a major explanation for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. There is a need to enhance the ALA content and to reduce the ratio of linoleic acid (LA) to ALA. Six &#x003c9;-3 (&#x00394;-15) fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes were cloned from rice and soybean. The subcellular localizations of the proteins were identified. The FAD genes were introduced into rice under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, <italic> GluC </italic> , or a <italic> Ubi-1 </italic> promoter to evaluate their potential in increasing the ALA content in seeds. The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0.36 mg g <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> to 8.57 mg g <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> and 10.06 mg g <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> , respectively, which was 23.8- and 27.9-fold higher than that of non-transformants. The trait of <span class="trait">high</span> ALA content was stably inheritable over three generations. Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds. Overexpression of ER-localized <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2/3</span> and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds. The <italic> GluC </italic> promoter is advantageous compared with <italic> Ubi-1 </italic> in this experimental system. The enhanced ALA was preferentially located at the <italic> sn </italic> -2 position in triacylglycerols. A meal-size portion of <span class="trait">high</span> ALA rice would meet &#x0003e;80% of the daily adult ALA requirement. The ALA-rich rice could be expected to ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency.

						Rice is one of the most important staple foods for a large part of the world&#x02019;s population. Storage components, including fatty acids, accumulated in seed are highly stable. However, rice seed has a very low ALA content (&#x0003c;0.4 mg g <sup> &#x02212;1 </sup> ) and a <span class="trait">high</span> ratio of LA to ALA (&#x0223c;24:1); therefore, varieties containing <span class="trait">high</span> amounts of ALA could ameliorate much of the global dietary ALA deficiency. To date, some efforts have employed heterologous <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3</span> </italic> expression strategies to enhance the ALA content in rice seeds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"> Shimada <italic> et al. </italic> (2000) </xref> expressed tobacco <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3</span> </italic> in rice under the control of a <italic> Cauliflower mosaic virus </italic> (CaMV) <italic> 35S </italic> promoter and obtained stable transgenic rice with ALA content increased up to 2.5-fold compared with wild-type seed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"> Anai <italic> et al. </italic> (2003) </xref> obtained rice seed with 13-fold the ALA content by introducing soybean <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3</span> </italic> under the control of the maize ubiquitin-1 ( <italic> Ubi-1 </italic> ) promoter. CaMV <italic> 35S </italic> and <italic> Ubi-1 </italic> are constitutive expression promoters that are not strong enough in rice seed ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"> Qu and Takaiwa, 2004 </xref> ). The use of a strong endosperm-specific promoter might help to increase the accumulation of ALA in rice endosperm.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						&#x003c9;-3 Fatty acid deficiency is one of the most prevalent nutritional problems in the world. Because of a declining supply of deep sea fish and a reduced content of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids in land-based <span class="trait">oil</span> crops, developing a &#x003c9;-3 fatty acid-enriched staple plant food through traditional plant breeding or molecular biological strategies would be beneficial. Cereal seeds contain a low level of ALA, which might be due to the low level of FAD3, the major LA desaturase in seeds ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Vrinten <italic> et al. </italic> , 2005 </xref> ). It was reported that ALA synthesis in seeds was mainly catalysed by microsomal FAD (FAD3) ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"> Vrinten <italic> et al. </italic> , 2005 </xref> ). Six <span class="gene">FAD3</span> genes were cloned from rice and soybean, and their subcellular localizations were identified. <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1/2/3</span> and OsFAD3 were localized in the ER, while OsFAD7 and OsFAD8 were localized in the chloroplast ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Fig. 1 </xref> ). The ER-localized <italic> OsFAD3 </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> </italic> were overexpressed in rice under the control of the strong endosperm-specific promoter <italic> GluC </italic> . The OsFAD3 mRNA and protein level in GO seeds was increased 18.2- and 23.6-fold, respectively, as compared with the NT seeds ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figs 2b </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> 3b </xref> ). <span class="gene">GmFAD3-1</span> was also expressed at a <span class="trait">high</span> level in GG lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figs 2b </xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> 3b </xref> ). <span class="trait">High</span> expression of <span class="gene">FAD3</span> proteins greatly increased the content of ALA and decreased that of LA in transgenic rice endosperm, with no detrimental effects on growth, development, seed weight, or other <span class="trait">yield</span> traits (data not shown). The ALA content in seeds of GG and GO lines was increased 23.8- and 27.9-fold, respectively, compared with that of the NT lines ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Fig. 4 </xref> ). However, endosperm-specific expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3-2</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD3-3</span> </italic> slightly increased the ALA level in transgenic rice seeds ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ers051/-/DC1"> Supplementary Table S1 </ext-link> at <italic> JXB </italic> online). These results reflect the functional differences of ER-localized FAD isoforms. The chloroplast-localized FADs can also convert LA to ALA, but the overexpression of the two chloroplast-localized &#x003c9;-3 <italic> FAD </italic> genes <italic> OsFAD7 </italic> and <italic> OsFAD8 </italic> under the control of the <italic> GluC </italic> promoter resulted in only a slight increase in the ALA level in rice seeds ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ers051/-/DC1"> Supplementary Table S1 </ext-link> ).

						Due to predominant self-pollination, intensive selection during domestication and following genetic improvement, and genetic drift, extensive LD was observed for FA traits in soybean, especially in cultivated soybean (i.e. landrace and modern accessions) [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23"> 23 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56"> 56 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57"> 57 </xref> ]. Therefore, although resolution was limited, the association mapping approach employing diverse soybean cultivars allowed the identification of QTNs using a relatively small density of markers. In the present study, marker-trait association analysis detected 33 SNPs associated with at least one FA trait. Although further validations in independent panels or bi-parental populations are desirable, the co-localization of a group of associated loci with known genes/QTLs (as evidenced for Map-6017 in <italic> <span class="gene">GmSACPD-B,</span> </italic> Map-6506 in <italic> <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C,</span> </italic> and Map-6064 near <italic> <span class="gene">GmFATB1a</span> </italic> related with linolenic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid, respectively) suggests that the LD-based association mapping approach is suitable for detecting reliable associations with FA traits. These functional SNPs are essential tools for molecular soybean breeding programmes aimed at improving the FA quality of seeds and processed <span class="trait">oil.</span> In the future, labor/time-saving and cost effective SNP assays, such as Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) and Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) assays, might be exploited based on these functional SNPs for assisted selection of specific desirable FA compositions, such as soybean varieties with increased stearic acid (&#x0003e;20&#x000a0;%) for food and industrial products [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58"> 58 </xref> ]. It is important to note that some associations may have failed to be detected in this study owing to the limited marker density. A <span class="trait">high</span> density marker or sequencing-based analysis (i.e. re-sequencing, Genotyping by Sequencing etc.) should be conducted to further deepen our understanding of the genetic architecture of FAs in soybean using LD-based association mapping approach.

						The results of metabolic engineering experiments emphasize the importance of several processes in the control of seed protein accumulation. The first one is the biosynthesis of nitrogenous assimilates in source leaves. Constitutive overexpression of asparagine synthetase (AS) 1 ( <italic> ASN1 </italic> ) in <italic> Arabidopsis thaliana </italic> led to higher levels of free asparagine in developing siliques and increased seed protein concentration ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"> Lam <italic> et al. </italic> , 2003 </xref> ). According to results from similar experiments in <italic> Brassica napus </italic> , seed protein concentration may be increased only under nitrogen-sufficient conditions ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48"> Seiffert <italic> et al. </italic> , 2004 </xref> ). In these studies, the use of a constitutive promoter did not allow the effects in source and sink tissues to be distinguished. In soybean, <span class="trait">high</span> <italic> <span class="gene">AS1</span> </italic> transcript levels in source leaves are positively correlated with seed protein concentration ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59"> Wan <italic> et al. </italic> , 2006 </xref> ), and, in roots, are associated with an elevated ratio of asparagine versus aspartate in xylem sap transported to the shoot ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"> Antunes <italic> et al. </italic> , 2008 </xref> ). A second mechanism exerting control is phloem loading of transported amino acids ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63"> Zhang <italic> et al. </italic> , 2010 </xref> ). Inactivation of the phloem-localized amino acid transporter AAP2 in <italic> A. thaliana </italic> led to increased seed <span class="trait">yield</span> and <span class="trait">oil</span> concentration, consistent with the above noted negative relationship with protein concentration. Results obtained with the <italic> aap2 </italic> mutant were consistent with the observation of an increased rate of nitrogen translocation to the phloem in rape cultivars with <span class="trait">high</span> protein concentration ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"> Lohaus and Moellers, 2000 </xref> ). Thirdly, uptake of amino acids by the embryo mediated by amino acid transporters has been demonstrated as a key step controlling seed protein accumulation ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"> Rolletschek <italic> et al. </italic> , 2005 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"> Gotz <italic> et al. </italic> , 2007 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61"> Weigelt <italic> et al. </italic> , 2008 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42"> Sanders <italic> et al. </italic> , 2009 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51"> Tan <italic> et al. </italic> , 2010 </xref> ). Lastly, enhanced provision of organic acids for nitrogen assimilation and interconversion of amino acids may stimulate protein accumulation. This was observed after seed-specific transgenic expression of a bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38"> Rolletschek <italic> et al. </italic> , 2004 </xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"> Radchuk <italic> et al. </italic> , 2007 </xref> ). Transgenic expression of a barley sucrose transporter in endosperm led to increased sucrose uptake, and enhanced nitrogen and prolamine concentration in wheat grain ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60"> Weichert <italic> et al. </italic> , 2010 </xref> ).

						To investigate further the genetic factors underlying free asparagine levels in developing seed in relation to protein concentration, a second inbred population was selected for study. Population X4050 had been developed through a cross between AC Brant and X3145, and a molecular marker recombination map developed using a subset of 96 RILs. Four QTLs influencing protein concentration had been detected located on chromosomes 20, 15, 1, and 6 (LGs I, E, D1a, and C2, respectively) (SJM and ERC, unpublished). The chromosome 20 (LG I) QTL had a major effect, determining 56% of the population variation for the trait ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"> Table 1 </xref> ). This result is consistent with the description of a major QTL determining protein concentration at the same location in several other populations ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64"> Zhao-ming <italic> et al. </italic> , 2011 </xref> ). Protein concentration QTLs located on chromosomes 15 (LG E) near marker Satt575 and 1 (LG D1) near Satt077 have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"> Diers <italic> et al. </italic> (1992) </xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"> Csanadi <italic> et al. </italic> (2001) </xref> , respectively. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, a protein concentration QTL has not been previously reported on chromosome 6 (LG C2) near Satt520. To evaluate the effect of each QTL on free asparagine levels in developing seeds, a subset of two parents and 10 RILs representing eight genotypes were selected to study the effect of the maternal A allele at each of the four QTLs in combination with the paternal B allele at the other three QTLs, and also the reciprocal four allelic combinations. Relative to the oilseed type parent AC Brant, which has the A allele at all four QTLs, lines with the B allele from X3145 at loci on LGs I and E had a significantly increased free asparagine concentration and total free amino acids. This was not the case for QTLs on LGs D1a and C2. Consistent with this, relative to X3145, which has the B allele at all four QTLs, lines with the A allele at the QTL on the LGs I and E had significantly lower free asparagine and total free amino acids. Line 46 with the A allele at the LG D1a QTL also had significantly lower free asparagine levels and total free amino acids relative to X3145, but line 47 with the A allele at the LG <span class="gene">C2</span> QTL was not significantly different from X3145 for the two parameters. This analysis associated the protein concentration QTLs on LGs I and E with the <span class="trait">high</span> free asparagine trait in developing seed.

						In various animal species, several syndromes resembling type 2 DM either occur spontaneously or can be induced experimentally by different procedures [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ]. None of these syndromes is able to reproduce the complexity of human diabetes. It should be noted that two well-recognized experimental models of type 2 DM without associated obesity (i.e., partially pancreatectomized rats and rats subjected to a neonatal administration of streptozotocin) are characterized by a substantial reduction in beta-cell mass [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref> &#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"> 26 </xref> ] that is considered to occur also in type 2 DM patients [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"> 27 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref> ]. In a commonly used genetic model of type 2 DM, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, beta -cell mass depletion precedes the onset of metabolic abnormalities [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"> 29 </xref> ]. In rats neonatally administered STZ (n-STZ rats), another remarkable difference from type 2 DM is the lack of insulin response to tolbutamide in the presence of glucose [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> ]. In <span class="gene">GK</span> rats, a stimulatory effect on insulin release from isolated islets has been shown after incubation with glucose and gliclazide [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref> ]. In the present study, the experimental models of type 2 DM were modified from Masiello <italic> et al. </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"> 14 </xref> ]. The method took advantage of the partial protection exerted by suitable dosages of nicotinamide against the beta-cytotoxic effect of STZ to form an experimental diabetic syndrome in adult rats that appears closer to type 2 DM than other available animal models. Other advantages of this syndrome include 1) the facility of the induction of diabetes, 2) the <span class="trait">high</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> of mildly diabetic animals, and 3) the stability of metabolic alterations. This is the reason this animal model was chosen in this study.

						Sequence data for the parental lines V71-370 and PI 407162 were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous SNPs within the 23 selected genes, based on transcript abundance from a microarray analysis, to identify candidate genes that might contribute to variation in root phenotypes. Only three of these genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table"> 4 </xref> ), had non-synonymous SNPs, two in the <italic> G. soja </italic> line, PI 407162 ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g09860</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> ) and one gene ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> ) in both parental lines that had altered the amino acid content (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table"> 9 </xref> ). The gene <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g09860</span> </italic> encodes triglyceride lipase, showed higher transcript abundance and was in the QTLs identified for root distribution based on length and thickness (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table"> 3 </xref> ). The remaining two genes, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> , encode apoptosis inhibitory 5 family protein and oxidoreductase/transition metal ion binding protein, respectively. These two genes also showed higher transcript abundance and mapped to the taproot length QTL intervals. Missense mutations were also identified in four of 18 genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table"> 8 </xref> ) with significant differences in transcript abundance selected within the root total length and surface area QTL confidence interval on chromosome 6 (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table"> 7 </xref> ) ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g45920,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma06g44900,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma06g46170,</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma06g45910</span> </italic> ) (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table"> 9 </xref> ). There was an insertion/deletion variation (Indel) in the coding sequence of two genes from the <italic> G. soja </italic> parent, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g45510</span> </italic> (insertion) and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g45261</span> </italic> (deletions), which were in the cell cycle-associated <italic> D6 type cyclin </italic> gene and the key hormone auxin-associated gene, <italic> auxin efflux carrier protein </italic> gene. Five out of nine genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table"> 8 </xref> ) selected from another wild soybean IT182932 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"> 8 </xref> ] had similar conserved missense mutations (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table"> 10 </xref> ) to those in the wild soybean, PI407162, used in this study. <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g46490</span> </italic> encodes a TPR transcription factor with <span class="trait">high</span> expression that is limited to the root pericycle cells (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ). <table-wrap id="Tab9"> <label> Table 9 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> List of genes associated with root traits and with the non-synonymous SNPs in V71-370 and PI 407162 parental lines </bold>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The differential expression of root-related genes from the <italic> G. soja </italic> accession and cultivated soybean parent enabled us to gain an understanding of the gene regulation associated with various root architecture traits. Based on transcript abundance, 10 genes were identified with significant expression fold changes among the parental lines (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig"> 6 </xref> ). Nine genes had a significantly higher expression in the <italic> G. soja </italic> parental line compared with the <italic> G. max </italic> parent, while gene <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> showed the opposite trend. When sequence comparisons were made, three genes ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g09860,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> , and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> ) had non-synonymous SNPs (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table"> 9 </xref> ). Only the gene <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> had a non-synonymous mutation in both parental lines. The <italic> kinesin motor family protein </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma09g32280</span> </italic> ) had the highest expression in wild soybean, which may have contributed to the smaller and finer roots. <fig id="Fig6"> <label> Figure 6 </label> <caption> <p> <bold> Expression patterns of genes with <span class="trait">high</span> transcript abundance within the root QTL peaks detected among parental lines and selected Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) selected. </bold>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Eleven genes were selected based on transcript abundance (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table"> 4 </xref> ) from within the QTL intervals on chromosome 7 for the root diameter distribution based on length and thickness (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table"> 3 </xref> ) Three of these genes, <italic> Kinesin like proteins </italic> , <italic> triglyceride lipase </italic> , and <italic> ATP-dependent RNA helicase </italic> showed higher expression in RILs with the smallest root phenotypes. These three genes could represent prime candidate genes that play a critical role in regulating fine root development and distribution based on length and thickness. The additive effect taproot length QTL (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table"> 5 </xref> ) involves interaction of gene(s) on chromosome 7 ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> ) and chromosome 15 ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> ), both of which show <span class="trait">high</span> levels of expression in RILs with extreme root phenotypes (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig"> 6 </xref> ). Non-synonymous mutations were present in both of these genes in V71-370 and PI407162. The genes in the QTL interval region for root thickness of 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mm ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma08g19050</span> </italic> ) and taproot length ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> ) showed higher expression in RILs with roots smaller than the <italic> G. soja </italic> parent.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Among the 18 genes selected in QTLs based on the <italic> G. soja </italic> IT182932 sequence (Tables&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table"> 7 </xref> and <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table"> 8 </xref> ), only three genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table"> 7 </xref> ) encoding <italic> peroxidase </italic> (two genes) and <italic> CASP like protein </italic> showed differential gene expression associated with the root phenotype of the parents and RILs (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig"> 7 </xref> B). The missense mutations in these two <italic> peroxidase </italic> genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table"> 9 </xref> ) might contribute to the higher levels of expression in <italic> G. soja </italic> than in <italic> G. max </italic> ; however, this needs to be validated with further gene knockout experiments. One of the genes with a non-synonymous SNP on chromosome 6, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g46210</span> </italic> , encodes a NEDD8-activating complex and showed an interesting pattern of expression in the RILs, with higher expression in one of the <span class="trait">high</span> (HR2) and low extreme RILs (LR3) (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig"> 8 </xref> ). Higher gene expression in both the extreme root phenotypes (low and <span class="trait">high)</span> could possibly be explained by an additive nature of the loci and their interaction (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table"> 5 </xref> ) to produce a better parental root phenotype. However, other genes with deleterious mutations (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table"> 8 </xref> ) showed significantly different expression patterns between parental lines. The LR3 line showed higher expression levels for most of the mutated genes identified in this study. Even though these RILs were selected based on allelic composition in this particular QTL confidence interval, they differed substantially for allelic composition within other regions of chromosome 6 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media"> 4 </xref> : Figure S3) and at the whole genome level. Thus, the gene expression in LR3, with the smallest root size, may reflect the enrichment of the <italic> G. max </italic> -derived alleles at all these loci.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Among the 10 candidate genes (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table"> 4 </xref> ) identified based on transcript abundance from the microarray analysis, <italic> kinesin </italic> was also found to be highly expressed in maize root tissues [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref> ]. Other genes, such as <italic> carboxylesterase 6 like </italic> and <italic> histone-like CCAAT transcription factor </italic> , were also found to be highly expressed (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ) in root pericycle cells, which regulate lateral root formation. These genes were also found to be upregulated in water-deficit conditions based on an Affymetrix gene chip study (Babu et al. unpublished) of different root regions. The <italic> carboxylesterase 6 like </italic> gene was highly upregulated under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions in root region 2 (4- to 8-mm tip). It was also upregulated in the root region 1 (0&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mm) following <span class="trait">drought</span> stress, but at lower levels compared with region 2. The role of this gene in the maintenance of root growth during <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions has yet to be studied. Candidate genes identified in the <italic> G. soja </italic> line, such as <italic> Apoptosis inhibitor 5 related </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma07g32480</span> </italic> ), <italic> slow anion channel associated 1-like </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> ), and <italic> Metacaspase </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma08g19050</span> </italic> ) (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table"> 4 </xref> ), showed <span class="trait">high</span> expression in root-related tissues (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig"> 5 </xref> ) and could be key candidates to improve root length and diameter in cultivated soybean, which might increase nutrient and water use efficiency. Emphasis should be placed on characterizing the function of an uncharacterized gene, <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma15g42220</span> </italic> , which is associated with soybean root system architecture, because it showed higher expression in RILs with the shortest root length and surface area compared with RILs with the longest root length. The sequence of this gene is similar to that of <italic> slow anion channel associated 1 </italic> in other crops, which is involved in osmoregulation, phosphorus uptake [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51"> 51 </xref> ], and aluminum tolerance [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52"> 52 </xref> ]. It is also reported to be involved in regulating the exchange of water vapor and gas during <span class="trait">drought</span> stress [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53"> 53 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The genes with <span class="trait">high</span> levels of transcript abundance expressed only in root tissues within the QTL region of chromosomes 6 (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table"> 7 </xref> ) had distinct expression patterns in the cultivated and <italic> G. soja </italic> parents. Similar trends of gene expression were reported for genes related to stress, defense response, and redox pathways observed in wild soybean [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54"> 54 </xref> ] and wild tomato [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55"> 55 </xref> ] compared with their respective cultivated types. Among the 18 genes identified based on sequence information from a wild soybean, two <italic> peroxidase </italic> genes ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g45910</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g45920</span> </italic> ) in different clades of the heat map showed <span class="trait">high</span> expression in the <italic> G. soja </italic> line (Figure&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig"> 7 </xref> B). One of these <italic> peroxidase </italic> genes maps to a duplicated region [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56"> 56 </xref> ] and showed higher expression in the RILs with small or larger root phenotypes. A similar trend of gene expression was observed in tomato introgression lines developed between cultivated and wild tomatoes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57"> 57 </xref> ]. This peroxidase gene in PI407162 also had a non-synonymous SNP variation that changed an amino acid from serine to alanine. Similar effects on root size of amino acid changes were reported in the phosphorylation of the ETHYLENE <italic> INSENSITIVE2 </italic> gene in Arabidopsis [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58"> 58 </xref> ]. Zhu et al. [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59"> 59 </xref> ] reported that the peroxidase activity was spatiotemporal in root tissues and was involved in both cell wall loosening and tightening under water-deficit conditions. Voothuluru and Sharp [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60"> 60 </xref> ] also reported the effect of <italic> peroxidase </italic> genes on apoplastic reactive oxygen species in the root apical region and its effect on cell wall modification in maize roots as a part of a <span class="trait">drought</span> adaptive mechanism. The single copy genes identified in the present study could also be used as informative markers for phylogenetic and comparative analyses across various taxonomic levels [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61"> 61 </xref> ].

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our results indicated that non-synonymous SNP mutations in genes underlying the QTL region on chromosome 6 are critical candidate genes to study root growth and development. In particular, we identified the gene encoding NEDD8-activating complex, a ThiF protein family (Pfam ID: 00899) that is associated with production of ubiquitin-activating enzyme <span class="gene">E1</span> (Panther ID: 10953), which controls phosphate starvation responses through shoot and root modifications. This gene showed higher expression in wild soybean PI 407162 and the HR2 RIL with higher total root length and surface area. This expression pattern indicated that the transcriptional landscape of <italic> G. soja </italic> lines was highly diverged relative to cultivated soybean at this particular locus. The homologous gene to <italic> NEDD8-activating complex </italic> also showed higher expression in wild tomatoes than in cultivated tomatoes, as a result of accelerated evolution [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55"> 55 </xref> ]. The HR2 RIL&#x02019;s higher expression for this gene might have occurred as a result of the interaction between the <italic> G. soja </italic> -derived mutated allele (containing five non-synonymous SNPs within the coding region) and the <italic> G. max </italic> -derived allele and para-mutating its effect. Similar mechanisms underlying the gene expression levels were observed in a maize inter-mated mapping population [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62"> 62 </xref> ]. Thus, this transcript with <span class="trait">high</span> expression from wild soybeans is a candidate to increase root length through coordinating cell division and elongation dynamics, as has been reported in wild tomatoes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31"> 31 </xref> ]. The TPR transcription factor, with a non-synonymous mutation, was identified among a number of <italic> G. soja </italic> accessions (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table"> 10 </xref> ) and showed similar expression patterns in both parental lines and RILs. A similar class of transcription factor was reported to be expressed in roots as an early response to iron availability in soybeans [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63"> 63 </xref> ]. Mutations of key genes with insertions or deletions associated with rate of cell divisions ( <italic> D6 type cyclin </italic> and <italic> auxin efflux carrier protein </italic> ) might result in the shorter root phenotypes in <italic> G. soja </italic> , PI407162, compared with V71-370. Sequences derived from other <italic> G. soja </italic> accessions [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"> 8 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ] also showed the same non-synonymous SNP in these same genes. As a result, the altered protein products of these two genes might have resulted in shooter root phenotypes in all wild soybeans. Similar molecules were reported in Arabidopsis and rice to influence cortex-endodermis division regulated by the <italic> SHORT-ROOT </italic> transcription factor [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64"> 64 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65"> 65 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Based on the whole genome re-sequence, information from 17 accessions, which represent diverse <italic> G. soja </italic> accessions from Korea [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8"> 8 </xref> ] and China [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ], also showed conserved non-synonymous SNPs in most of the root related genes identified in this study (Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table"> 10 </xref> ). Among different plant species, soybeans are reported to have a higher average ratio of Nonsyn/Syn SNPs than Arabidopsis and rice, with larger effect SNPs in 4,648 genes that have greater effects on their functions [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ]. In addition, 21% of potential SNP loci were fixed during the domestication process from wild soybeans. Therefore, the genes identified in the present study might represent candidates with <span class="trait">high</span> biological significance for root system growth and development. These genes may play a key role in maintaining short root phenotypes of wild soybeans. A strong candidate for further study is the auxin responsive gene, <italic> NEDD8-activating complex, </italic> because it influences the total root length and involves a key hormone, auxin, which regulates the root growth and development. In Arabidopsis, this gene interacts with a <italic> CULLIN </italic> gene, which then alters the growth of lateral roots and root hairs [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66"> 66 </xref> ]. Similar results were observed in elite lines of rice in which SNPs altered the expression of <italic> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase </italic> gene associated with the ABA content. A rice line with this missense mutation had produced more lateral roots [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67"> 67 </xref> ]. For the uncharacterized gene ( <italic> <span class="gene">Glyma06g46170</span> </italic> ), a gain of a stop codon in the <italic> G. soja </italic> PI 407162 makes this a potential candidate gene to further study the functional effects associated with root development in soybeans. Therefore, the root-related genes with non-synonymous mutations identified in this study are a valuable genetic resource to study the evolution of root system development in soybeans. The candidate genes identified from the <italic> G. soja </italic> accession, PI 407162, are promising targets to improve root system architecture in cultivated soybeans. However, RILs with soja alleles show undesirable phenotypes, such as <span class="trait">lodging</span> and poor <span class="trait">yield,</span> which could be eliminated by a series of backcrosses with the cultivated soybean, V71-370.

						The FA composition of <italic> Supraspinatus </italic> (SS) muscle from goats fed varying level of BCPO is shown in Table&#x000a0; <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table"> 7 </xref> . Regardless of the diet, the most abundant FA in <span class="gene">SS</span> was C18:1n-9 followed by C16:0 and C18:0 in that order. The proportion of C16:0 and C16:1n-7 decreased ( <italic> P </italic> &#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) while that of C18:1n-9, C18:1 <italic> trans </italic> -11, CLA cis-9 <italic> trans </italic> -11, C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3n increased ( <italic> P </italic> &#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) as the level of BCPO increased in diet. The proportion of C18:0, C18:2n-6 and C20:4n-6 was not influenced ( <italic> P&#x02009;&#x0003e; </italic> &#x02009;0.05) by diet. The total saturated fatty acids (SFA), the n-6/n-3 ratio and ID 16 decreased ( <italic> P </italic> &#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) while the total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), PUFA/SFA ratio, ID 18 and elongation index increased ( <italic> P </italic> &#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with increase in the level of BCPO in diet. <table-wrap id="Tab7"> <label> Table 7 </label> <caption> <p> Least square means for the fatty acid composition (% of total FA) of <italic> supraspinatus </italic> muscle in goats fed graded levels of blend of 80&#x000a0;% canola <span class="trait">oil</span> and 20&#x000a0;% palm <span class="trait">oil</span>

						Regardless of the diet, the most abundant FA in <span class="gene">SS</span> was C18:1n-9 and its concentration was influenced by diet. This observation is in tandem with previous studies in goats [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35"> 35 </xref> ], sheep [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36"> 36 </xref> ] and cattle [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38"> 38 </xref> ] in which C18:1n-9 was identified as the most abundant FA in muscle following dietary <span class="trait">oil</span> supplementation. The increase in C18:1n-9 in response to BCPO could be due to the increase in dietary C18:1n-9 and/or increase in the &#x00394; 9 desaturase enzyme activities (ID 18) necessary for the de novo conversion of C18:0 to C18:1n-9. This observation is consistent with those observed in a companion <italic> in vitro study </italic> where the ruminal concentration of C18:1n-9 after 24&#x000a0;h incubation increased as the level of BCPO increased in the substrate [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"> 17 </xref> ]. As found in the current study, supplementation of 3.3&#x000a0;% canola <span class="trait">oil,</span> canolamide or canola oil-canolamide mix <span class="trait">oil</span> increased the concentration of C18:1n-9 in bovine milk [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"> 5 </xref> ]. Conversely, 3&#x000a0;% dietary canola <span class="trait">oil</span> compared with 3&#x000a0;% palm <span class="trait">oil</span> did not affect the concentration of C18:1n-9 in <italic> longissimus lumborum </italic> muscle from goats [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48"> 48 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The concentration of C18:1 <italic> trans </italic> -11 Vaccenic and CLA cis-9 <italic> trans </italic> -11 in <span class="gene">SS</span> increased as BCPO increased in diet. This observation could be due to the increase in the dietary concentration of unsaturated fatty acids. Both C18:1 <italic> trans </italic> -11 Vaccenic and CLA <italic> cis </italic> -9 <italic> trans </italic> -11 are intermediate products of ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated FA [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"> 13 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14"> 14 </xref> ]. Feeding unsaturated FA causes incomplete biohydrogenation of unsaturated FA accompanied with biohydrogenation intermediates [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13"> 13 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14"> 14 </xref> ]. In addition, it has been established that &#x00394; 9 desaturation of C18:1 <italic> trans </italic> -11 Vaccenic in adipose tissue could <span class="trait">yield</span> CLA cis-9 <italic> trans </italic> -11 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17"> 17 </xref> ]. In line with the current observation, supplementation of 3.3&#x000a0;% canola <span class="trait">oil,</span> canolamide or canola oil-canolamide mix (Loor et al. [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5"> 5 </xref> ] and 1&#x000a0;kg/day canola <span class="trait">oil</span> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50"> 50 </xref> ] increased the concentration of C18:1 <italic> trans </italic> -11 Vaccenic and CLA <italic> cis </italic> -9 <italic> trans </italic> -11 in bovine milk compared with the control diet.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The proportion of C18:0, C18:2n-6 and C20:4n-6 in <span class="gene">SS</span> was not influenced by diet. In contrast, the concentration of C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3 increased linearly in response to dietary BCPO. Similarly, Karami et al. [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48"> 48 </xref> ] found that 3&#x000a0;% canola <span class="trait">oil</span> compared with 3&#x000a0;% palm <span class="trait">oil</span> did not affect the concentration of C18:0, C18:2n-6 and C20:4n-6 but enhanced the concentration C18:3n-3 in <italic> longissimus lumborum </italic> muscle from goats. However, the authors did not observe increment in the concentration of long chain n-3 FA. The linear increase in the proportion of C18:3n-3 in goats fed 4 and 8&#x000a0;% BCPO relative to those fed control diet could be responsible for the increase in the proportion of C20:5n-3 in their muscles since the FA is a metabolite of C18:3n-3 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4"> 4 </xref> ] suggesting <italic> in vivo </italic> elongation and desaturation. This coincides with the linear increase in the elongation index in response to supplementation of BCPO. This observation is consistent with those of Gjerlaug-Enger et al. [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52"> 52 </xref> ] who observed that dietary rapeseed products enhanced the concentration of C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3 and C22:5n-3 in <italic> longissimus dorsi </italic> muscle of pork compared with the control diet.

						However, because of the inactivity of COs, gene modification mediated by this molecule is only obtained by the random encounter between COs and the target sequence. The low efficiency (approximately 1&#x000d7;10 <sup> &#x02013;4 </sup> ) of this strategy limits its applicability in plants. Since the double strands breaks (DSBs) introduced on target loci could strongly increase the frequency of homologous recombination (HR) [ <xref rid="pone.0122755.ref025" ref-type="bibr"> 25 </xref> ], we proposed that DSB might also promote the efficiency of GT with COs. The <span class="trait">high</span> activity of DSB-inducing nucleases might partially complement the &#x0201c;inactivity&#x0201d; of the COs. Previous study showed that a single base transition of C <sup> 317 </sup> -T within the <italic> OsEPSPS </italic> , causing a change of proline-106 to leucine (P106L) in the protein sequence, exhibited glyphosate <span class="trait">resistance</span> in EPSPS-deficient <italic> Escherichia coli </italic> ( <italic> E </italic> . <italic> coli </italic> ) strain, AB2829 [ <xref rid="pone.0122755.ref026" ref-type="bibr"> 26 </xref> ]. In the present study, we attempted to achieve the similar glyphosate <span class="trait">resistance</span> in rice by direct substitution of the target base C <sup> 317 </sup> to T in the coding sequence of <italic> OsEPSPS </italic> via TALEN assisted with COs molecule. Therefore, a TALEN construct was designed to induce a DSB near the C <sup> 317 </sup> , and three COs molecules, including one with typical length of 68 nt, called C0 and two structurally improved ones with longer length of 88 nt, called <span class="gene">C1</span> and C2, respectively, were designed to <italic> in situ </italic> substitute C <sup> 317 </sup> to T. In addition to separate transformation of TALEN or COs, the two structurally improved <span class="gene">C1</span> and <span class="gene">C2</span> were also co-transformed into the rice with TALEN, respectively. As an alternative, a homologous recombination plasmid (HRP) that contains a modified 898 bp <italic> OsEPSPS </italic> homologous fragment was also co-transformed with TALEN as a GT donor since the homologous fragments were usually used as template for repairing the DSB in GT process [ <xref rid="pone.0122755.ref003" ref-type="bibr"> 3 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0122755.ref004" ref-type="bibr"> 4 </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0122755.ref027" ref-type="bibr"> 27 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To test the cleaving activity of the designed TALEN construct in rice, the pCAMBIA1301M-TALEN was first transformed independently into rice calli via biolistic bombardment. Four mutants with bases deletions were found after sequencing all of the 19 independent hygromycin-resistant calli lines on the target locus ( <xref rid="pone.0122755.t001" ref-type="table"> Table 1 </xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122755.g003" ref-type="fig"> Fig 3 </xref> ). The <span class="trait">high</span> mutation rate (21%) indicated that the TALEN construct had sufficient activity to introduce a DSB at the target site. Then, to test whether the DSB can promote base substitution, we bombarded the calli with the TALEN construct plus three donor molecules (HRP, <span class="gene">C1</span> and C2, respectively), which were designed to replace the C <sup> 317 </sup> by T in the genome. The resulting hygromycin-tolerant calli were selected and the target sequences were amplified and subjected to sequencing. Mutations were identified in 13 out of 86 independent transgenic calli (15.1%). Most of the mutants contained base deletions in the target sequence, but failed to substitute the target base C <sup> 317 </sup> (Tables <xref rid="pone.0122755.t001" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122755.t002" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> ). Only one mutant derived from the co-transformation with TALEN and <span class="gene">C1</span> involved a substitution of C <sup> 317 </sup> -T, accompanied by 12 bases deletion (Tables <xref rid="pone.0122755.t001" ref-type="table"> 1 </xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122755.t002" ref-type="table"> 2 </xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122755.g003" ref-type="fig"> Fig 3 </xref> ).

						<span class="trait">Oil</span> biodegradation (mainly C <sub> 11 </sub> to C <sub> 30 </sub> alkanes) from the microcosm experiments (and from the bottle experiments) was followed using GC&#x02013;MS analysis of the soils at the end of the experiment. One gram of each soil was extracted three times in 5 ml dichloromethane (DCM, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and then sonicated for 25 min at 10&#x000b0;C. The extracted supernatant was mixed with sodium sulfate and was filtered with non-absorbent cotton to remove solid particles. The filtrate was then evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The dry extract was re-dissolved into DCM and passed through silica gel prior to injection into GC&#x02013;MS (Perkin Elmer Clarus 600GC/MS). The Perkin Elmer Clarus 600C <span class="gene">MS</span> was coupled with Rtx <sup> &#x000ae; </sup> -5MS capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm I.D. &#x000d7; 0.25 &#x003bc;m film thickness; maximum temperature, 350&#x000b0;C). Ultra-high purity helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min. The ionizing energy was 70 eV. Electron multiplier (EM) voltage was obtained from autotune. The injection, transfer line and ion source temperatures were 290, 280, and 280&#x000b0;C, respectively. The oven temperature program was held at 80&#x000b0;C for 5 min and then accelerated at a rate of 10&#x000b0;C/min to 280&#x000b0;C (hold for 30 min). The volume of injected sample was 1 &#x003bc;l with a split ratio of 10:1. The standard mix solution (C <sub> 7 </sub> to C <sub> 30 </sub> ) of concentrations 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 ppm were used for confirmation and quantification purposes. A calibration curve conformed by the standard mixtures was established and quantification of the analyzed compounds was performed in the linear range of the calibration curve. The alkanes were identified based on GC retention times of the standard, injected and analyzed under the same conditions as samples and by comparing the spectra obtained with mass spectrum libraries (NIST 2011 v.2.3 and Wiley, 9th edition).

						Inter-individual variation in the response to food and its components is commonplace. For example, in a study examining the effect of increased olive <span class="trait">oil</span> consumption on lowering LDL-cholesterol level, only 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;% of people responded in the predicted way with a lower LDL-cholesterol level, 10&#x000a0;% of people had the opposite response and around 60&#x000a0;% of people failed to respond at all <sup> ( </sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32"> <sup> 32 </sup> </xref> <sup> ) </sup> . Red meat is associated with an increased cancer risk across a number of studies; a meta-analysis has shown an approximately 20&#x000a0;% increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with red meat consumption more than five times per week <sup> ( </sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33"> <sup> 33 </sup> </xref> <sup> ) </sup> . A French population study has identified a subpopulation of around 4&#x000a0;% with polymorphisms in the cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> genes, who have almost a 50-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer from red meat intake when consumed over five times per week <sup> ( </sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34"> <sup> 34 </sup> </xref> <sup> ) </sup> . This finding suggests that models for cost-effectiveness may need to consider nutrigenomics and phenotypes, and determination of the cost-effectiveness of many interventions needs to target the population at risk and not the general population.
