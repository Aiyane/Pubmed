				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy protein is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the acidic (A) polypeptides of glycinin, basic (B) polypeptides of glycinin, and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in glycinin (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of glycinin and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in glycinin subunit, and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in glycinin subunit when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in glycinin subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In recent years, the application of natural substances on crops has been intensified in order to increase the <span class="trait">resistance</span> and <span class="trait">yield</span> of the soybean crop. Among these products are included plant biostimulants that may contain algae extracts, amino acids, and plant regulators in their composition. However, there is little information on the isolated effect of each of these constituents. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the application of isolated amino acids on the antioxidant metabolism of the soybean crop. Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with the application of the amino acids glutamate, phenylalanine, <span class="trait">cysteine,</span> glycine in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment, and foliar application at V4 growth stage. Antioxidant metabolism constituents evaluated were superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide <span class="trait">content,</span> proline, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, <span class="trait">resistance</span> enzymes as polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were evaluated. In both experiments, the use of <span class="trait">cysteine,</span> only in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and in both <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> and catalase. Also in both experiments, the use of phenylalanine increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> when the application was carried out as foliar application or both in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. In the field experiment, the application of glutamate led to an increase in the activity of the catalase and <span class="gene">PAL</span> enzymes for <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. The use of the set of amino acids was only efficient in foliar application, which led to a greater activity of the enzymes peroxidase, PAL, and polyphenol oxidase. The other enzymes as well as lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide presented different results according to the experiment. Therefore, glutamate, <span class="trait">cysteine,</span> phenylalanine, and glycine can act as signaling amino acids in soybean plants, since small doses are enough to increase the activity of the antioxidant enzymes.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared to β-conglycinin, glycinin contains 3-4 times the methionine and <span class="trait">cysteine</span> (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the glycinin and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for glycinin (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of glycinin and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of glycinin. These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.
