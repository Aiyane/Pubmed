				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of <span class="trait">glycinin</span>.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						These results indicated that the SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of acidic (A) polypeptide of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on protein aggregates formation.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> cDNA was modified and used to produce structurally altered 11S storage protein subunits.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Some of the insertions significantly increased the methionine <span class="trait">content</span> in the <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit.
