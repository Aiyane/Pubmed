				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						During ongoing proteomic analysis of the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) germplasm collection, PI 603408 was identified as a landrace whose seeds lack accumulation of one of the major <span class="trait">seed</span> storage <span class="trait">glycinin</span> protein subunits. Whole genomic resequencing was used to identify a two-base deletion affecting <span class="trait">glycinin</span> 5 The newly discovered deletion was confirmed to be causative through immunological, genetic, and proteomic analysis, and no significant differences in total <span class="trait">seed</span> protein <span class="trait">content</span> were found to be due to the <span class="trait">glycinin</span> 5 loss-of-function mutation per se In addition to focused studies on this one specific <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit-encoding gene, a total of 1,858,185 nucleotide variants were identified, of which 39,344 were predicted to affect protein coding regions. In order to semiautomate analysis of a large number of soybean gene variants, a new SIFT 4G (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerated 4 Genomes) database was designed to predict the impact of nonsynonymous single nucleotide soybean gene variants, potentially enabling more rapid analysis of soybean resequencing data in the future.

						Compared to β-conglycinin, <span class="trait">glycinin</span> contains 3-4 times the methionine and cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acids), accounting for approximately 40 and 30%, respectively, of the total storage protein in soybean. Increasing the soybean storage protein <span class="trait">content</span> while improving the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin is of great significance for soybean breeding and soy food products. The objective of this study is to analyze the genetic mechanism regulating the <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin contents of soybean by using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong 1138-2. Two hundred and twenty-one markers were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S) contents, the ratio of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> to β-conglycinin (RGC), and the sum of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin (SGC). A total of 35 QTLs, 3 pairs of epistatic QTLs, and 5 major regions encompassing multiple QTLs were detected. Genes encoding the subunits of β-conglycinin were localized to marker intervals sat_418-satt650 and sat_196-sat_303, which are linked to RGC and SGC; marker sat_318, associated with 11S, 7S, and SGC, was located near <span class="gene">Glyma10g04280</span> (Gy4), which encodes a subunit of <span class="trait">glycinin.</span> These results, which take epistatic interactions into account, will improve our understanding of the genetic basis of 11S and 7S contents and will lay a foundation for marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding of soybean and improving the quality of soybean products.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						It is well-known that disulfide-mediated interactions are important when soy protein is heated, in which soy proteins are dissociated and rearranged to some new forms. In this study, the disulfide bond (SS) linked polymer, which was composed of the acidic (A) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α of β-conglycinin, was formed as the major product, accompanied by the formation of SS-linked dimer of B and monomer of A as minor products. The role of sulfhydryl (SH) of different subunits/polypeptides for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> was investigated. The SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> (Cys298 of G1, Cys289 of G2, Cys440 of G4) was transformed into <span class="gene">SS</span> in polymer identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of polymer was lower than that of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β-conglycinin subunits when heated. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of B in polymer was lower than that in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit, and both of them were decreased by heating. The SH <span class="trait">content</span> of A in polymer was increased and higher than that of B in polymer and A in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit when heated. These results indicated that the SH of B in <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit was subjected to not only SH oxidation but also SH-SS exchange (with <span class="gene">SS</span> of A) for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer. The SH oxidation and SH-SS exchange were proven by the change of SH <span class="trait">content</span> for the first time. The SH of B was suggested to be reactive for forming intermolecular <span class="gene">SS</span> of polymer.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, soy proteins were reduced with 0.1-10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) to obtain an increasing number of sulphydryl groups (SH) with a similar particle size. Aggregation was promoted by increasing the degree of reduction when heated (100°C, 30min), resulting in larger sized aggregates (from 40 to 70nm) and a higher viscosity of the aggregate dispersion. The disulphide bond (SS) <span class="trait">content</span> decreased and the less <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer, which was composed of acidic (A) polypeptide of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> basic (B) polypeptides of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> and a small amount of α' and α subunits of β-conglycinin, was formed with increasing reduction degree, suggesting that SH/SS polymerisation was not the driving force for aggregation. The larger aggregates with increasing degrees of reduction were composed of more B of <span class="trait">glycinin</span> and β of β-conglycinin, suggesting that the A and the small amount of α' and α in the <span class="gene">SS</span> linked polymer have an inhibiting effect on protein aggregates formation.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A nontargeted protein identification method was developed to screen for adulterations in skimmed-milk powder (SMP). There are indications of falsified SMP <span class="trait">content</span> due to the addition of plant proteins. To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the developed comparative LC-MS method using a quadrupole TOF <span class="gene">MS</span> instrument, adulterated SMP samples were prepared by the addition of protein isolates of soy and pea to skimmed-milk before pasteurisation and evaporation. The comparative LC-MS approach enabled unequivocal discrimination of those SMP samples containing soy and pea protein from nonadulterated SMP. To identify the source of (plant) proteins present in the adulterated SMP, data-dependent LC-MS/MS was used in combination with an include list of differential peptides. Numerous peptides originating from the major <span class="trait">seed</span> proteins of soy <span class="trait">(glycinin,</span> beta-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified in this way.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The expression of the alpha and <span class="gene">alpha'</span> subunits of beta-conglycinin was suppressed by sequence-mediated gene silencing in transgenic soybean <span class="trait">seed.</span> The resulting seeds had similar total oil and protein <span class="trait">content</span> and ratio compared with the parent line. The decrease in beta-conglycinin protein was apparently compensated by an increased accumulation of <span class="trait">glycinin.</span> In addition, proglycinin, the precursor of <span class="trait">glycinin,</span> was detected as a prominent polypeptide band in the protein profile of the transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> extract. Electron microscopic analysis and immunocytochemistry of maturing transgenic soybean seeds indicated that the process of storage protein accumulation was altered in the transgenic line. In normal soybeans, the storage proteins are deposited in pre-existing vacuoles by Golgi-derived vesicles. In contrast, in transgenic <span class="trait">seed</span> with reduced beta-conglycinin levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles were observed that resembled precursor accumulating-vesicles of pumpkin seeds and the protein bodies accumulated by cereal seeds. Their ER-derived membrane of the novel vesicles did not contain the protein storage vacuole tonoplast-specific protein alpha-TIP, and the sequestered polypeptides did not contain complex glycans, indicating a preGolgi and nonvacuolar nature. <span class="trait">Glycinin</span> was identified as a major component of these novel protein bodies and its diversion from normal storage protein trafficking appears to be related to the proglycinin buildup in the transgenic <span class="trait">seed.</span> The stable accumulation of proteins in a protein body compartment instead of vacuolar accumulation of proteins may provide an alternative intracellular site to sequester proteins when soybeans are used as protein factories.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> cDNA was modified and used to produce structurally altered 11S storage protein subunits. We evaluated these modified subunits for their ability to assemble into oligomers. Alterations made in the acidic polypeptide changed the subunit solubility characteristics but did not eliminate assembly. Modifications in the basic polypeptide usually eliminated assembly of subunits into trimers. A region exhibiting high natural variability located at the COOH terminus of the acidic polypeptide that we have designated the hypervariable region was also studied. Extensive deletions and insertions were tolerated in the hypervariable region without perturbing subunit assembly. Some of the insertions significantly increased the methionine <span class="trait">content</span> in the <span class="gene">Gy4</span> <span class="trait">glycinin</span> subunit. Together, our results indicated that the structure of the basic polypeptide was more critical for assembly of trimers than that of the acidic polypeptide, an observation that implies that the basic polypeptides direct trimer formation. The assembly assays described here will be useful in efforts to improve <span class="trait">seed</span> quality. Using them, the effects of modifications to the storage protein subunits can be rapidly evaluated before introducing the mutated genes into plants.
