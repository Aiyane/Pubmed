						Plant LRR-RLKs serve as protein interaction platforms, and as regulatory modules of protein activation. Here, we report the isolation of a novel plant-specific <span class="gene">LRR-RLK</span> from Glycine soja (termed GsLRPK) by differential screening. GsLRPK expression was cold-inducible and shows Ser/Thr protein kinase activity. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that GsLRPK is localized in the plasma membrane. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that temperature, salt, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and ABA treatment can alter GsLRPK gene transcription in G. soja. However, just protein induced by cold stress not by salinity and ABA treatment in tobacco was found to possess kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of GsLRPK in yeast and Arabidopsis can enhance <span class="trait">resistance</span> to cold stress and increase the expression of a number of cold responsive gene markers.

						Pod dehiscence (shattering) is essential for the propagation of wild plant species bearing seeds in pods but is a major cause of <span class="trait">yield</span> loss in legume and crucifer crops. Although natural genetic variation in pod dehiscence has been, and will be, useful for plant breeding, little is known about the molecular genetic basis of shattering <span class="trait">resistance</span> in crops. Therefore, we performed map-based cloning to unveil a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling pod dehiscence in soybean. Fine mapping and complementation testing revealed that the QTL encodes a dirigent-like protein, designated as Pdh1. The gene for the shattering-resistant genotype, pdh1, was defective, having a premature stop codon. The functional gene, Pdh1, was highly expressed in the lignin-rich inner sclerenchyma of pod walls, especially at the stage of initiation in lignin deposition. Comparisons of near-isogenic lines indicated that <span class="gene">Pdh1</span> promotes pod dehiscence by increasing the torsion of dried pod walls, which serves as a driving force for pod dehiscence under low humidity. A survey of soybean germplasm revealed that pdh1 was frequently detected in landraces from semiarid regions and has been extensively used for breeding in North America, the world's leading soybean producer. These findings point to a new mechanism for pod dehiscence involving the dirigent protein family and suggest that pdh1 has played a crucial role in the global expansion of soybean cultivation. Furthermore, the orthologs of pdh1, or genes with the same role, will possibly be useful for crop improvement.

						The zinc finger protein is one of the proteins with finger-like domain. Some of them are transcription factors which play important role in plant growth and plant <span class="trait">resistance</span> to abiotic stresses. In this paper, a novel C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> (GenBank accession number JQ692081) was isolated from soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) This gene has a 699 bp ORF (open reading frame) with no intron and encodes a 24.9 kDa protein with 233 amino acids. Its isoelectric point (pI) is 8.33. The <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> protein contains two typical C2H2-type zinc finger domains. Both of them have highly conserved amino acid sequence-QALGGH which is a particular characteristic of plant. Transient expression of the GFP-SCTF-1 protein in onion epidermal cell showed that <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> was localized in cell nuclei. RT-PCR results showed that <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> gene was expressed with high levels in flowers and leaves in soybean, but low in roots and stems. The expression of <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> gene was strongly induced by low temperature in the soybean seedlings. Overexpression of <span class="gene">SCTF-1</span> enhanced cold tolerance of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) compared to the control.

						Transcriptional repressors are emerging as central regulators of development and stress responses in different organisms. The ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif was identified as essential for transcriptional repression. To gain a better understanding of this type of protein, we reported here a novel <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein from soybean. Sequence alignment showed that <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> contains one AP2/ERF domain, two putative nuclear localization signal regions and one EAR motif. The <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> protein was preferentially localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells and bound specifically to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> was induced by ethylene, JA, SA, cold, salt, <span class="trait">drought,</span> and soybean mosaic virus, and repressed by ABA. Constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmERF4</span> in transgenic tobacco plants increased tolerance to salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses compared with wild-type plants, but did not exhibit detectable <span class="trait">resistance</span> against bacterial infection.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A new member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, <span class="gene">GmERF3,</span> was isolated from soybean. Sequence analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> contained an AP2/ERF domain of 58 amino acids and two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains. It belonged to a group IV protein in the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily as typified by a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. Expression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> was induced by treatments with high salinity, <span class="trait">drought,</span> abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV), whereas there was no significant <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> mRNA accumulation under cold stress treatment. <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> could bind to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element, and was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> protein fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast. Ectopic expression of the <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> gene in transgenic tobacco plants induced the expression of some PR genes and enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> against infection by Ralstonia solanacearum, Alternaria alternata, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and gave tolerance to high salinity and dehydration stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> in transgenic tobacco led to higher levels of free proline and soluble carbohydrates compared to wild-type plants under <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. The overall results suggested that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> as an AP2/ERF transcription factor may play dual roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plants guard themselves against pathogen attack using multi-layered defense mechanism. Calcium represents an important secondary messenger during such defense responses. Upon examination of a pepper cDNA library, we observed that the gene CaSRC2-1 (Capsicum annum SRC2-1) was upregulated significantly in response to infection with the type II non-host pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines 8 ra, which elicits a hypersensitive response. CaSRC2-1 encodes a protein that contains a <span class="gene">C2</span> domain and it exhibits a high degree of homology to the protein Soybean genes regulated by cold 2 (SRC2). However, little is known about how <span class="gene">SRC2</span> expression is elicited by biotic stresses such as pathogen challenge. Further sequence analysis indicated that the CaSRC2-1 <span class="gene">C2</span> domain is unique and contain certain amino acids that are conserved within the <span class="gene">C2</span> domains of other plants and animals. CaSRC2-1 transcription was up-regulated under both biotic and abiotic stress conditions, including bacterial and viral pathogen infection, CaCl(2) and cold treatment, but unaffected by treatment with plant defense-related chemicals such as salicylic acid, methyl jasmonic acid, ethephone, and abscisic acid. Intriguingly, under steady state conditions, CaSRC2-1 was expressed only in the root system. A CaSRC2-1-GFP fusion protein was used to determine localization to the plasma membrane. A fusion protein lacking the <span class="gene">C2</span> domain failed to target the membrane but remained in the cytoplasm, indicating that the <span class="gene">C2</span> domain plays a critical role in localization. Thus, CaSRC2-1 encodes a novel <span class="gene">C2</span> domain-containing protein that targets the plasma membrane and plays a critical role in the abiotic stress and defense responses of pepper plants.

						There are three major pathways of CO <sub> 2 </sub> assimilation and fixation: C <sub> 3 </sub> , C <sub> 4 </sub> and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) pathways. C <sub> 4 </sub> plants can minimize photorespiration by separating initial CO <sub> 2 </sub> fixation and the Calvin cycle in different cell types, and CAM plants can fix carbon at night, and are more tolerant to <span class="trait">drought</span> stress due to their more efficient carbon fixation and specialized anatomical features ( <xref rid="plx025-B13" ref-type="bibr"> Ashraf and Harris 2013 </xref> ). Recently, <xref rid="plx025-B13" ref-type="bibr"> Ashraf and Harris (2013) </xref> comprehensively described the progress made during the last two decades in producing transgenic lines of different C <sub> 3 </sub> crops with enhanced photosynthetic performance either due to introgression of genes encoding C <sub> 4 </sub> enzymes into C <sub> 3 </sub> plants or overexpression of C <sub> 3 </sub> enzymes or transcription factors (TF). Usually, C <sub> 4 </sub> and CAM plants are best adapted to arid environments, because they have higher photosynthetic efficiency as well as WUE as compared with C <sub> 3 </sub> plants ( <xref rid="plx025-B43" ref-type="bibr"> Fischer and Turner 1978 </xref> ). Likewise, <xref rid="plx025-B71" ref-type="bibr"> Kim <italic> et al. </italic> (2014) </xref> reported that overexpression of <italic> Capsicum annuum </italic> <span class="trait">drought</span> stress responsive 6 (CaDSR6) in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> plants led to higher tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> as compared with wild type plants. <xref rid="plx025-B113" ref-type="bibr"> Saad <italic> et al. </italic> (2013) </xref> also showed that the stress-responsive <span class="gene">NAC1</span> ( <italic> SNAC1 </italic> ) gene controlled signalling of sucrose phosphate synthase type 2C protein phosphatases, 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-5-kinase as well as regulatory components of ABA receptor in wheat plants under <span class="trait">drought</span> stress. Overall, a variety of genes contributing to <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance in plants have been explored and characterized in <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> . However, few of these genes have been tested in other crops, and only under controlled or laboratory conditions instead of natural field conditions.

						Amongst the most commonly used herbicides are glyphosate and bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile). Glyphosate restricts growth by reducing aromatic amino acid biosynthesis while bromoxynil prevents photosynthesis by affecting PSII activity ( <xref rid="plx025-B127" ref-type="bibr"> Stalker <italic> et al. </italic> 1988 </xref> ). The development of glyphosate resistant crops would help plants resist the glyphosate and thus reduce <span class="trait">yield</span> losses. Research efforts have been successful in identifying and characterizing glyphosate <span class="trait">resistance</span> genes and to date various 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) resistant genes have been identified. <xref rid="plx025-B118" ref-type="bibr"> Shah <italic> et al. </italic> (1986) </xref> developed glyphosate resistant petunia using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, resulting in 20-fold amplification of the ESPS synthase gene. Similarly, <xref rid="plx025-B133" ref-type="bibr"> Tian <italic> et al. </italic> (2013) </xref> developed a transgenic rice cultivar through the incorporation of <italic> MdEPSPS </italic> , a gene conferring glyphosate <span class="trait">resistance,</span> in <italic> Malus domestica </italic> , which they identified after five rounds of DNA shuffling and screening; amongst the eight mutations in the amino acid sequence of this gene only two were identified as site directed and important for glyphosate <span class="trait">resistance.</span> <xref rid="plx025-B127" ref-type="bibr"> Stalker <italic> et al. </italic> (1988) </xref> isolated and cloned the <italic> bxn </italic> gene from the soil bacterium <italic> Klebsiella ozaenae </italic> . This gene codes for nitrilase and mediates conversion of bromoxynil to its primary metabolite form (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid), and when introduced into tobacco, enhanced bromoxynil <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Recently, <xref rid="plx025-B65" ref-type="bibr"> Iwakami <italic> et al. </italic> (2014) </xref> isolated two cytochrome <span class="gene">P450</span> genes of CYP81A, i.e. <italic> CYP81A12 </italic> and <italic> CYP81A21 </italic> , from a noxious weed <italic> Echinochloa phyllopogon </italic> that is resistant to the herbicides bensulphuron-methyl and penoxsulam, and developed transgenic <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> expressing either of these genes that showed enhanced herbicide <span class="trait">resistance</span> through the <italic> O </italic> -demethylation of herbicides. These results indicate that the characterization and understanding of molecular mechanisms and the development of resistant crops can help withstand the devastating effects of pathogens and pests and provide an important alternative to chemical dependent agriculture.

						Efficient working of the ammonium transporter, OsAMT1, helps transgenic rice plants to achieve and maintain sufficient levels of ammonium, the major source of nitrogen for rice. This suggests the role of this transporter in enhancing NUE, growth and <span class="trait">yield</span> under optimal as well as suboptimal nitrogen conditions ( <xref rid="plx025-B110" ref-type="bibr"> Ranathunge <italic> et al. </italic> 2014 </xref> ). NRT1.1 functions as a nitrate sensor and can enhance high to low affinity nitrate transporters in the protein kinase CIPK23 dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of intracellular threonine, thereby changing NRT1.1&#x02019;s ability to mediate efficient nitrate transport ( <xref rid="plx025-B102" ref-type="bibr"> Parker and Newstead 2014 </xref> ). Moreover, nodule inception (NIN)-like protein (NLP) TFs are the master regulators of nitrate response, and upon binding with the nitrate responsive <italic> cis </italic> -element activate nitrate-responsive transcription, which is further modulated by nitrate signalling at the post-translational level. Suppression of <span class="gene">NLP</span> function results in impeded expression of several nitrate-inducible genes ( <xref rid="plx025-B74" ref-type="bibr"> Konishi and Yanagisawa 2013 </xref> ). <xref rid="plx025-B25" ref-type="bibr"> Castaings <italic> et al. </italic> (2009) </xref> reported that <italic> nlp7 </italic> mutants show impaired nitrate signal transduction, and that its expression pattern and function in sensing nitrogen are closely associated with each other. <xref rid="plx025-B77" ref-type="bibr"> Kuo and Chiou (2011) </xref> suggested that micro-RNAs have a putative rolein regulating the nutrient starvation genes at post-transcriptional levels.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Genetic engineering approaches for enhancing NUE range from increasing the solubility of mineral nutrients and remobilization within the plant to transport and accumulation within storage organs. Recently, <xref rid="plx025-B158" ref-type="bibr"> Zhou <italic> et al. </italic> (2014) </xref> developed transgenic soybean in which constitutive overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> </italic> (&#x003b2;-expansin) increased leaf expansion and improved phosphate efficiency. Overexpression of expansin genes, e.g. <italic> HvEXPB1 </italic> in barley ( <xref rid="plx025-B78" ref-type="bibr"> Kwasniewski and Szarejko 2006 </xref> ) and <italic> OsEXPA17 </italic> in rice ( <xref rid="plx025-B152" ref-type="bibr"> Yu <italic> et al. </italic> 2011 </xref> ), improved phosphate uptake through induction of better root hair growth even under phosphate-deficient conditions. Remobilization of nutrients within a plant is critical for their survival, and manipulation of transporter genes for efficient remobilization of nutrients is an important strategy. For example, overexpression of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> </italic> transporter gene enhanced phosphate remobilization, <span class="trait">yield</span> and related attributes like phosphorus use efficiency and quantum <span class="trait">yield</span> in soybean ( <xref rid="plx025-B124" ref-type="bibr"> Song <italic> et al. </italic> 2014 </xref> ). To enhance NUE through genetic manipulations, a thorough understanding about the factors governing efficient mineral uptake and remobilization within the plant is necessary. The use of methods such as transcription profiling, analysis of mutants defective in their response to mineral deficiency and investigation of plants showing normal growth under nutrient stress are pre-requisites.
