						This assay was designed to evaluate <span class="trait">resistance</span> to SBL under field conditions; <span class="trait">resistance</span> was scored as percent defoliation, which includes the effects of antibiosis and antixenosis. A field-cage containing the null, M, E, H, G, ME, MGH, and MGHE NILs was installed at the University of Georgia Plant Sciences Farm (Fig.&#x000a0; <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig"> 3 </xref> c). The experiment was planted on 1 July 2013 in a randomized complete block design with 15 replications. The experimental unit was a 6-plant hill plot (Bonnett and Bever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11"> 1947 </xref> ); each block contained one plot per NIL. Hills were spaced 76.2&#x000a0;cm apart and were thinned to six plants after germination. A single border row of Benning hill plots surrounded the experiment. After the plants reached the <span class="gene">V2</span> stage, a cage covered with 0.9&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.9&#x000a0;mm Saran screen (Asahi Kasei, Tokyo, Japan) was placed over the experimental area. This confined the test insects and prevented immigration of parasitoids, predators, and other insect pests. The hill plots were infested when plants reached the <span class="gene">V3</span> stage. Each hill plot was initially infested with 200 caterpillars. After that, 50&#x000a0;neonate caterpillars were added to the each hill plot twice a week for 2&#x000a0;consecutive&#x000a0;weeks. The percent defoliation for each hill of plants was estimated by four researchers at 5, 7, 11, and 14&#x000a0;days after the first infestation. A second field cage containing the null, M, E, ME, MGH, and MGHE NILs was planted in 26 August 2013. This cage was infested and evaluated for defoliation as described for the first cage.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The development of superior soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., cultivars exhibiting <span class="trait">resistance</span> to insects has been hindered due to linkage drag, a common phenomenon when introgressing alleles from exotic germplasm. Simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used previously to map soybean insect <span class="trait">resistance</span> (SIR) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a'Cobb' X PI 229358 population, and subsequently used to create near-isogenic lines (NILs) with <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL i n a 'Benning' genetic background. <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTLs were mapped on linkage groups (LGs) M (SIRQTL-M), G (SIRQTL-G), and H (SIRQTL-H). The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate linkage drag for seed <span class="trait">yield</span> by using Benning-derived NILs selected for SIRQTL-M, SIRQTL-H, and SIRQTL-G; 2) assess the amount of PI 229358 genome surrounding the <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL in each Benning NIL; and 3) evaluate the individual effects these three QTLs on antibiosis and antixenosis to <span class="trait">corn</span> <span class="trait">earworm,</span> Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker). <span class="trait">Yield</span> data collected in five environments indicated that a significant <span class="trait">yield</span> reduction is associated with SIRQTL-G compared with NILs without <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL. Overall, there was no <span class="trait">yield</span> reduction associated with SIRQTL-M or SIRQTL-H. A significant antixenosis and antibiosis effect was detected for SIRQTL-M in insect feeding assays, with no effect detected in antixenosis or antibiosis assays for SIRQTL-G or SIRQTL-H without the presence of PI 229358 alleles at SIRQTL-M. These results support recent findings concerning these loci.
