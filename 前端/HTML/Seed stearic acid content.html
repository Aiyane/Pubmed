				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid;</span> however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (Glycine max) 'Forrest' was screened to identify mutants within the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutants were identified to have high levels of <span class="trait">seed,</span> nodule, and leaf <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C</span> enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content,</span> and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of <span class="gene">GmSACPD-C.</span> Finally, we report that <span class="gene">Gmsacpd-c</span> mutations cause an increase in leaf <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.

						BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) seeds are the primary source of edible oil in the United States. Despite its widespread utility, soybean oil is oxidatively unstable. Until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent chemical hydrogenation, a process which also generates trans fats. An alternative to chemical hydrogenation is genetic modification of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil through identification and introgression of mutant alleles. One target for improvement is the elevation of a saturated fat with no negative cardiovascular impacts, <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid,</span> which typically constitutes a minute portion of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil (~3%). RESULTS: We examined radiation induced soybean mutants with moderately increased <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> (10-15% of <span class="trait">seed</span> oil, ~3-5 X the levels in wild-type soybean seeds) via comparative whole genome hybridization and genetic analysis. The deletion of one <span class="gene">SACPD</span> isoform encoding gene (SACPD-C) was perfectly correlated with moderate elevation of <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> However, <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion lines were also found to have altered nodule fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> composition and grossly altered morphology. Despite these defects, overall nodule accumulation and nitrogen fixation were unaffected, at least under laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Although no <span class="trait">yield</span> penalty has been reported for moderate elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds, our results demonstrate that genetic alteration of <span class="trait">seed</span> traits can have unforeseen pleiotropic consequences. We have identified a role for fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> biosynthesis, and <span class="gene">SACPD</span> activity in particular, in the establishment and maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

						Soybean oil has a wide variety of uses, and <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid,</span> which is a relatively minor component of soybean oil is increasingly desired for both industrial and food applications. New soybean mutants containing high levels of the saturated fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate <span class="trait">content</span> from 6&#x02013;14% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid,</span> which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type <span class="trait">seed</span> of the Williams 82 cultivar.

					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Three soybean genes have been characterized with homology to delta-9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturases (SACPDs) which are required for the conversion of <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> to oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> <xref rid="pone.0097891-Ohlrogge1" ref-type="bibr"> [3] </xref> . These genes are delimited SACPD-A, SACPD-B, and SACPD-C. <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> encodes the seed-specific isoform of this enzyme, where SACPD-A and <span class="gene">SACPD-B</span> transcripts accumulate in all soybean tissues <xref rid="pone.0097891-Byfield1" ref-type="bibr"> [1] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0097891-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> .

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybeans with mutations in the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> and <span class="gene">SACPD-B</span> genes have been described. FAM94-41 is a spontaneously occurring change in the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene and results in plants with levels of <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in the <span class="trait">seed</span> of &#x0223c;9% <xref rid="pone.0097891-Pantalone1" ref-type="bibr"> [5] </xref> . Deletion of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene in the A6 germplasm line results in up to 28% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in the <span class="trait">seed,</span> but the size of this deletion is uncharacterized <xref rid="pone.0097891-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0097891-Hammond1" ref-type="bibr"> [6] </xref> . Additional <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutants have been described with a range of 10-16% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in the seeds <xref rid="pone.0097891-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0097891-Boersma1" ref-type="bibr"> [7] </xref> . <span class="gene">SACPD-B</span> mutants have recently been reported to contain &#x0223c;10% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <xref rid="pone.0097891-Ruddle1" ref-type="bibr"> [8] </xref> . No mutations have been described for the SACPD-A gene. Some high stearate mutants have previously been associated with poor germination and low <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> <xref rid="pone.0097891-Lundeen1" ref-type="bibr"> [9] </xref> , <xref rid="pone.0097891-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr"> [10] </xref> however recently it was demonstrated that missense mutations in <italic> <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> </italic> are not associated with poor agronomic characteristics <xref rid="pone.0097891-Ruddle2" ref-type="bibr"> [11] </xref> . Additional sources of germplasm carrying novel mutations in the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene, or novel loci which influence <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels are needed to circumvent this issue to enable the production of soybeans with elevated levels of <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> to meet the demands of the food-oil market.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Sequencing of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene from these mutant lines revealed that each carries a distinct and independent missense mutation in the coding region of <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097891-g001"> Figure 1 </xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097891-t001"> Table 1 </xref> ). The sequence of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene in the Williams-82 accession that serves as the germplasm background for this mutant is consistent with the previously described soybean <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> sequence (Genbank #EF113911) <xref rid="pone.0097891-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> but not the Williams-82 sequence within the Phytozome database (version 9.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net"> www.phytozome.net </ext-link> ) which carries a frameshift mutation early in the first exon. The exons of the SACPD-A and <span class="gene">SACPD-B</span> genes <span class="gene">(Glyma07g32850</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma02g15600,</span> respectively) were also sequenced in these lines and were found to be identical to the Williams-82 sequence (not shown). As line 21084 and 18610 M <sub> 3 </sub> and M <sub> 4 </sub> individuals produced <span class="trait">seed</span> with a marginal increase in <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> from ranging from 5&#x02013;8%, to verify that these lines were homozygous the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene was sequenced from M <sub> 4 </sub> plants ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097891.s003"> Table S2 </xref> ). All of these M <sub> 4 </sub> individuals were homozygous for their respective mutations. This suggests that the mutations in these lines are less damaging to enzyme structure or function and the resultant plants display a marginal increase in <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid.</span>
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Visualization of the location of the affected amino acids in the determined crystal structure for the <span class="gene">SACPD</span> enzyme from <italic> Ricinus communis </italic> reveals that five of the six mutations are located in the enzyme channel domain which is composed of several alpha helixes, the function of this channel is to position the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> so that it can be oxidized ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097891.s001"> Figure S1 </xref> ) <xref rid="pone.0097891-Lindqvist1" ref-type="bibr"> [18] </xref> . <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> Y211C </sub> , <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> , <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> G224E </sub> , <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> H223R </sub> are located on alpha helix six, and <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A239T </sub> is located on alpha helix seven. The amino <span class="trait">acid</span> substitutions introduce either changes in side chain charge or size into this region of the enzyme. These mutations may reduce the ability of a fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> chain to be correctly positioned within the channel domain of the enzyme. Proximity of mutations to the di-iron core and increases in polarity also correlate with greater reduction of enzymatic function <xref rid="pone.0097891-Lindqvist1" ref-type="bibr"> [18] </xref> . <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> R329I </sub> is located on a loop residue after helix ten, and this mutation results in a less dramatic increase in <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> level. We speculate that this residue may be involved in correct folding of the active site or possibly in interaction with other proteins.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To demonstrate that changes in the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene cause the elevated <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> phenotype in these mutant lines, co-segregation analysis was performed in segregating populations. In each case the single nucleotide polymorphism introduced by the mutation was used to develop a codominant dCAPs marker. Lines 18948 (SACPD-C <sub> H223R </sub> ) and 14197 (SACPD-C <sub> Y211C </sub> ) were isolated as heterozygous mutants for <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutations. M <sub> 4 </sub> plants segregating for these SNPs were grown in the field during the 2011 growing season, and M <sub> 5 </sub> <span class="trait">seed</span> was genotyped for the SNP and phenotyped for fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097891-g002"> Figure 2A </xref> shows association of the SACPDC <sub> Y211C </sub> mutation with elevated levels of <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in the <span class="trait">seed.</span> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097891-g002"> Figure 2B </xref> shows cosegregation of SACPDC <sub> H223R </sub> with elevated levels of <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in the <span class="trait">seed.</span> Line 18190 (SACPD-C <sub> A218E </sub> ), which has the highest levels of stearate, was crossed to the cultivar Prize, allowed to self-pollinate, and F <sub> 2 </sub> plants were grown in the field (during the 2012 growing season) and genotyped. F <sub> 3 </sub> <span class="trait">seed</span> from F <sub> 2 </sub> individuals was analyzed for <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content.</span> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097891-g002"> Figure 2C </xref> shows the cosegregation of SACPDC <sub> A218E </sub> with elevated levels of stearate. In the SACPDC <sub> A218E </sub> x Prize segregating population, a number of homozygous mutant individuals were observed which contained <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels greater (&#x0003e;20% stearate) than those observed in the homozygous mutant isolate in the Williams-82 background (approximately 13%). This may be due to the segregation of a second, modifying locus distinct from that of the mutated <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> gene in the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> line. This genetic modifier may be in the outcross parent (Prize) genetic background, or it may be a second-site mutation in the heavily mutagenized background of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> parent line. It is estimated that the mutation frequency in the parent of <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> parent is on the order of 100 genic mutations per individual <xref rid="pone.0097891-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr"> [17] </xref> . The <span class="trait">seed</span> stearate level in the Prize parent grown in parallel was 4%, similar to Williams-82. As the other <span class="gene">SACPD</span> genes would be good candidates to act additively with <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> , the SACPD-A, -B, (and &#x02013;C) genes were sequenced in the Prize parent and found to encode predicted proteins with an amino <span class="trait">acid</span> sequence identical to the published reference sequence <xref rid="pone.0097891-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr"> [4] </xref> .
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Individuals from segregating populations were analyzed for <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> and genotyped for A. <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> Y211C </sub> (78 indivduals) B. <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> H223R </sub> (24 individuals), and C. <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> (89 individuals). White bars indicate wild-type individuals, grey bars indicate heterozygous individuals, and black bars indicate homozygous mutants.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						There is evidence that other, unknown loci in addition to <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> impact <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> <xref rid="pone.0097891-Ruddle1" ref-type="bibr"> [8] </xref> . The strong mutations in <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> described here are comparable to the defects observed in RG7 and RG8 which are also chemically induced point mutants in <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <xref rid="pone.0097891-Boersma1" ref-type="bibr"> [7] </xref> and may therefore serve as a basis for germplasm to enhance <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels. Weaker alleles such as <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> R329I </sub> and <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A239T </sub> may be useful when combined with other genes to increase <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> while maintaining high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> levels. In addition, identification of the factors that enable the &#x0003e;20% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels observed in association with <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> <sub> A218E </sub> may suggest to further increase <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels for a soybean oil with enhanced functionality.

						BACKGROUND: Variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> oil composition and <span class="trait">content</span> among soybean varieties is largely attributed to differences in transcript sequences and/or transcript accumulation of oil production related genes in seeds. Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. RESULTS: In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil <span class="trait">content.</span> Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> and <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

						In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil <span class="trait">content.</span> Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of <italic> FAB2C </italic> caused elevated oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> and <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively.

						Table&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"> 2 </xref> summarizes functions and accumulation levels of the 79 most abundant gene transcripts, which accounted for 50% of the total RNA population in soybean seeds. The most abundant transcript in seeds accumulated at 33,706 FPKM, accounting for 4.6% of all transcripts, encoded a 2S albumin precursor (Protease inhibitor/seed storage/LTP family) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> : Table S1). The highly abundant <span class="trait">seed</span> transcripts encode a variety of well-characterized proteins such as <span class="trait">seed</span> storage proteins, protease inhibitors, proteases, acyl lipid enzymes, oil body proteins and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, and as well proteins of unknown functions. Ten of the 79 most abundant genes encoded seeds storage proteins, which included four of six functional glycinin genes and four of eight &#x003b2;-conglycinin genes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"> 31 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"> 32 </xref> ]. Collectively, they amounted to almost one fifth of the total <span class="trait">seed</span> transcripts. Eleven highly abundant transcripts encoded enzymes and structural proteins involved in acyl lipid metabolism. They included the three lipoxygenases genes, <italic> Lox1 </italic> , <italic> Lox2 </italic> and <italic> Lox3 </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"> 33 </xref> ] and the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase gene, <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> </italic> , which encodes one of two enzymes converting oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> to linoleic <span class="trait">acid.</span> In addition, they contain six oleosin genes and one caleosin gene that function in oil body biogenesis and degradation [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"> 34 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37"> 37 </xref> ].

						One hundred eighty-eight genes, accounting for 24% of soybean acyl lipid genes, showed variations in their transcript accumulation levels in seeds (Table&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"> 4 </xref> ). A Fisher&#x02019;s exact test revealed that the functional category &#x0201c;synthesis of membrane lipids in plastids&#x0201d; was significantly overrepresented among genes with expression polymorphisms at a p-value of 0.042. There was no overrepresentation of genes with expression polymorphisms in any other acyl lipid functional category at a p-value cutoff of 0.05. Examples for genes with expression polymorphisms included the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> gene <span class="gene">(Glyma14g37350)</span> (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> : Table S2). The <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> gene encodes a linoleate desaturase in the &#x0201c;Synthesis of membrane lipids in plastids&#x0201d; category. While the FPKM and Z-score values for <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> were 12. 1 and -2.31 in N0304-303-3, respectively, the average FPKM value for the remaining eight lines was 43.57 FPKM. The 3.6 fold decrease in expression was correlated with a decrease in linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> levels (Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> A). <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> was the most abundant among the three gene transcripts encoding linoleate desaturases, whose products convert linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> into linolenic <span class="trait">acid.</span> The other two homologs, <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> </italic> <span class="gene">(Glyma02g39230)</span> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3C</span> </italic> <span class="gene">(Glyma18g06950),</span> had an average accumulation value of 27.88 and 11.33 FPKM, respectively. It is likely that the lower expression of <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> reduces accumulation of linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> levels in N0304-303-3, but the residual <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> expression in N0304-303-3 combined with the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3B</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3C</span> </italic> expression still result in a substantial amount of linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> in seeds.

						We tested the putative effect of the non-synonymous SNPs on protein function by using the prediction tools PROVEAN [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"> 42 </xref> ], and PolyPhen-2 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"> 43 </xref> ]. Based on a subset of SNPs in 102 randomly selected acyl lipid genes, 29% of non-synonymous SNPs were predicted to have deleterious effects on protein function (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2"> 2 </xref> : Table S5). One of the non-synonymous SNPs was located in the <italic> FAB2C </italic> gene <span class="gene">(Glyma14g27990),</span> which encodes one out of three stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturases expressed in seeds. This SNP altered codon 77 from GAC to AAC, and consequently caused an amino <span class="trait">acid</span> change from aspartic <span class="trait">acid</span> (Asp, an acidic polar aa) to asparagine (Asn, a polar aa) (Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> ). This SNP was only present in line FAM94-41. This <italic> FAB2C </italic> mutation in FAM94-41 is likely to result in the increased <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> level seen in Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> A [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"> 44 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref> ]. As both homologous genes <italic> FAB2B </italic> <span class="gene">(Glyma02g15600)</span> and <italic> FAB2A </italic> <span class="gene">(Glyma07g32850)</span> are functional in FAM94-41, it is likely that <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> can still be converted to oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> although at a lower rate. Interestingly, we observed that accumulation of the <italic> FAB2C </italic> transcript was reduced in FAM94-41 (190.1 FPKM vs the average of 433.1 FPKM) while the transcript accumulation of <italic> FAB2A </italic> (42.2 FPKM vs the average of 35.4 FPKM) and <italic> FAB2B </italic> (205.3 FPKM vs the average of 175.4 FPKM) were increased in FAM94-41. The increased <italic> FAB2A </italic> and <italic> FAB2B </italic> expression may be able to partially compensate for the reduction of FAB2C activity in FAM94-41.

This non-synonymous SNP results in an amino <span class="trait">acid</span> change from the acidic polar aspartic <span class="trait">acid</span> (Asp, encoded by GAC) to the polar asparagine (Asn, encoded by AAC), which renders the protein non-functional. FAM94-41 exhibits an elevated <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> phenotype as less <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> is converted into oleic <span class="trait">acid.</span>

						We identified a segment consisting of four adjacent genes <span class="gene">(Glyma18g02580,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma18g02590,</span> <span class="gene">Glyma18g02600</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma18g02610),</span> whose transcript accumulations were 15.5, 9.6, 8.0 and 9.0 times higher in Jack than their average expression level in the other eight lines, respectively (Figure&#x000a0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ). Interestingly, these genes were located in the previously characterized <italic> <span class="gene">Rhg1</span> </italic> locus (for <span class="trait">resistance</span> to <italic> H </italic> <italic> eterodera glycines </italic> ). It has been reported that overexpression of these genes confers <span class="trait">resistance</span> to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <italic> Heterodera glycines </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> ] <italic> . </italic> Jack is resistant to SCN [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref> ]. The co-ordinate elevated expression of the four genes is likely to lead to its SCN <span class="trait">resistance.</span> It has been shown that the copy numbers of a 31.2&#x000a0;kb fragment containing the four genes vary greatly in soybean lines, and their transcript accumulation is correlated with their copy number [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> ]. The SCN resistant Fayette cultivar has 10 copies while the susceptible Williams 82 cultivar has just one copy of this 31.2&#x000a0;kb fragment. We conducted shotgun sequencing of the Jack genome at a 10-fold average coverage (unpublished). Interestingly, the coverage for each of the four <italic> rhg1 </italic> genes was between 101 and 113 reads, indicating a 10 to 11-fold copy number increase of these genes. This suggests that the amplification of the <italic> rhg1 </italic> genes leads to their increased transcript accumulation and SCN <span class="trait">resistance</span> in Jack.

						Consistent with the previous reports, we independently identified a number of transcript sequence and expression polymorphisms potentially responsible for altered fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> composition. We showed that the <italic> FAB2C </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> </italic> ) gene encoding a stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase had a putatively damaging SNP in FAM94-41 [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"> 44 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"> 45 </xref> ]. <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> encodes a linoleate desaturase that introduces a third double bond in linoleic <span class="trait">acid</span> to form linolenic <span class="trait">acid.</span> Cardinal <italic> et al. </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65"> 65 </xref> ] suggest that lower expression of the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD3A</span> </italic> allele in N0304-303-3 is likely to cause a lower level of linolenic <span class="trait">acid</span> (18:3) <span class="trait">content</span> and is mirrored in our finding. M23 has a 164&#x000a0;kb deleted region containing the fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturase gene <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66"> 66 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67"> 67 </xref> ] and therefore, as expected, we detected little more than background expression of the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> gene in M23. Additionally, we detected a coordinated increase in the expression of the four genes comprising the <italic> rhg1 </italic> locus in cultivar Jack. The <italic> rhg1 </italic> locus has been shown to control the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) <span class="trait">resistance</span> trait through copy number variation [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"> 8 </xref> ]. Jack is a SCN resistant cultivar and was developed from Fayette, whose rhg1 locus is amplified by 10 fold [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"> 46 </xref> ]. We show here that the copy number of the genes in this locus was 10 fold higher than flanking genome sequences, indicating that the coordinated increased expression of those genes in Jack was caused by a copy number amplification.

						KEY MESSAGE: Two new sources of elevated <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> were identified and the feasibility of an elevated <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid,</span> high oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> germplasm was studied. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil typically contains 2-4% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid.</span> Oil with at least 20% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> is desirable because of its improved baking properties and health profile. This study identifies two new sources of high <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> and evaluates the interaction of high <span class="trait">stearic</span> and oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> alleles. TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755, high <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> 'Holladay' mutants, were crossed to FAM94-41-3, a line containing a point mutation in a seed-specific isoform of a Δ9-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (SACPD-C). F2-derived lines were evaluated for fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> <span class="trait">content</span> in four field environments. Sequencing of SACPDs in TCHM08-1087 and TCHM08-755 revealed distinct deletions of at least one megabase encompassing <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> in both lines. After genotyping, the additive effect for <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> was estimated at +1.8% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> point mutation and +4.1% for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletions. Average <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> in lines homozygous for the deletions was 12.2%. A FAM94-41-3-derived line and TCHM08-1087-11, a selection from TCHM08-1087, were crossed to S09-2902-145, a line containing missense mutations in two fatty <span class="trait">acid</span> desaturases (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). F1 plants were grown in a greenhouse and individual F2 <span class="trait">seed</span> were genotyped and phenotyped. No interaction was observed between either <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> or <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> and any of the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> mutant alleles. <span class="trait">Seed</span> homozygous mutant for SACPD-C/FAD2-1A/FAD2-1B contained 12.7% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> and 65.5% oleic <span class="trait">acid</span> while <span class="trait">seed</span> homozygous for the <span class="gene">SACPD-C</span> deletion and mutant for <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> and <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> averaged 10.4% <span class="trait">stearic</span> <span class="trait">acid</span> and 75.9% oleic <span class="trait">acid.</span>
