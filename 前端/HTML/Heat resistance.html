				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This study determined the effect of dietary soybean isoflavones on non-specific immunity and on mRNA expression of two HSPs in juvenile golden pompano Trachinotus ovatus under pH stress. Six diets were formulated to contain 0, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg of soybean isoflavones. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish in cylindrical tanks. After 56 days of feeding, 15 fish per tank were exposed to pH stress (pH ≈ 9.2) for 24 h. Serum total protein (TP), respiratory burst activity (RBA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), lysozyme (LYZ), complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), cortisol, hepatic total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and the relative mRNA expression of <span class="trait">heat</span> shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 90 (HSP90) were investigated. The results showed that after pH stress, serum TP, RBA, LYZ, C4, hepatic T-AOC and CAT levels were significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) while serum ALT, hepatic MDA and <span class="gene">HSP70</span> and <span class="gene">HSP90</span> mRNA expression levels were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, supplementation with soybean isoflavones significantly reduced levels of serum ALT (20, 40, 60 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups) and hepatic MDA (40, 60 and 80 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups). Supplemented groups had increased serum TP content (40 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups), RBA (20 and 40 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups), LYZ (40 and 60 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups), C3(20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups), hepatic SOD activity (40, 60 and 80 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups) as well as increased relative mRNA expression of hepatic <span class="gene">HSP70</span> (40, 60 and 80 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups) and <span class="gene">HSP90</span> (40 and 60 mg/kg soybean isoflavones groups) (P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that ingestion of a basal diet supplemented with 40-60 mg/kg soybean isoflavones could enhance <span class="trait">resistance</span> against pH stress in T. Ovatus to some degree.

						Heat-shock proteins such as <span class="gene">HSP70</span> and <span class="gene">HSP90</span> are important molecular chaperones that play critical roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses; however, the involvement of their co-chaperones in stress biology remains largely uninvestigated. In a screen for candidate genes stimulating cell death in Glycine max (soybean), we transiently overexpressed full-length cDNAs of soybean genes that are highly induced during soybean <span class="trait">rust</span> infection in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Overexpression of a type-III <span class="gene">DnaJ</span> domain-containing HSP40 <span class="gene">(GmHSP40.1),</span> a co-chaperone of HSP70, caused hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. The HR-like cell death was dependent on MAPKKKα and WIPK, because silencing each of these genes suppressed the HR. Consistent with the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif within the <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> coding sequence, GFP-GmHSP40.1 was exclusively present in nuclear bodies or speckles. Nuclear localization of <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> was necessary for its function, because deletion of the NLS or addition of a nuclear export signal abolished its HR-inducing ability. <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> co-localized with HcRed-SE, a protein involved in pri-miRNA processing, which has been shown to be co-localized with SR33-YFP, a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting a possible role for <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> in mRNA splicing or miRNA processing, and a link between these processes and cell death. Silencing <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> enhanced the susceptibility of soybean plants to Soybean mosaic virus, confirming its positive role in pathogen defense. Together, the results demonstrate a critical role of a nuclear-localized <span class="gene">DnaJ</span> domain-containing <span class="gene">GmHSP40.1</span> in cell death and disease <span class="trait">resistance</span> in soybean.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary soybean isoflavones (SI) supplementation on growth performance, innate immune responses, hepatic antioxidant abilities, <span class="trait">heat</span> shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression and <span class="trait">resistance</span> to the pathogen Vibrio harveyi in Trachinotus ovatus. A basal diet was supplemented with SI at 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 mg kg(-1) feed for 8 weeks. Significantly maximum weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were observed in treatment with 40 mg kg(-1) SI supplement (P &lt; 0.05). Feed conversion ratio (FCR), feeding rate (FR) and survival rate were not significantly different among treatments. Fish fed a diet with 40 mg kg(-1) SI showed significant increase in plasma total protein content, complement 3 content, lysozyme activity as well as respiratory burst activity, but decrease in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities (P &lt; 0.05). Increased plasma alkaline phosphatase activity, hepatic total antioxidative capacity, catalase activity and superoxide dismutase activity were also noticed in fish fed SI at 40 or 60 mg kg(-1) (P &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, the lowest hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content was observed in fish fed SI at 40 mg kg(-1) (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control, the relative level of <span class="gene">HSP70</span> mRNA in fish fed SI at 40-80 mg kg(-1) were significantly increased, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). After challenge with V. harveyi, significant higher post-challenge survival was observed in fish fed diets with 40-80 mg kg(-1) SI supplement than that in control group (P &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that dietary intake containing SI could enhance the immune ability of fish and improve its <span class="trait">resistance</span> to infection by V. harveyi. Especially supplementation with 40 mg kg(-1) SI to the fish for 8 weeks showed remarkable improvement in the growth, non-specific immune responses, hepatic antioxidant abilities and <span class="gene">HSP70</span> gene expression.

						Despite the complex effects of UV-B radiation on plants, recent studies have revealed a series of components implicated in UV-B-specific photomorphogenic (non-damaging) regulation in the circadian rhythm pathway (Ulm and Nagy, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr"> 2005 </xref> ). These components include the UV-B photoreceptor UV <span class="trait">RESISTANCE</span> LOCUS8 (UVR8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase (transducin/WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein) CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), the basic leucine-zipper transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), and its interacting partner LONG HYPOCOTYL5-LIKE (HYH) (Ulm, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr"> 2003 </xref> ). In addition, <italic> CHALCONE SYNTHASE </italic> ( <italic> <span class="gene">CHS</span> </italic> ) and other genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (e.g., flavonoids and phenylpropanoids) are positively activated in response to UV-B radiation (Heijde and Ulm, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"> 2012 </xref> ). On the other hand, UV-B radiation above ambient level, like other environmental stresses, elicits nonspecific (genotoxic) damage responses that trigger stress defense signaling (Jenkins, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"> 2009 </xref> ). In <italic> Arabidopsis thaliana </italic> , reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are induced by high dose UV-B irradiation (Heijde and Ulm, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"> 2013 </xref> ; Parihar et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr"> 2015 </xref> ). Genes activated by stress responses to high level UV-B are distinct from those playing a role in photomorphogenesis specific to low dose UV-B (M&#x000fc;ller-Xing et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr"> 2014 </xref> ). However, the mechanism by which UV-B stress triggers the intracellular defense signaling pathway remains poorly understood (M&#x000fc;ller-Xing et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr"> 2014 </xref> ).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nine members of the <span class="trait">heat</span> shock 70 (HSP70) protein family were differentially expressed in response to UV-B irradiation in Buseok relative to Cheongja 3, six of which were down-regulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> ). However, there was no significant difference in the expression patterns of <italic> <span class="gene">HSP70</span> </italic> genes between control and 0.5 or 6 h UV-B treatment in Buseok or Cheongja 3.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Another interesting result of the present study is that <italic> TIR-NBS-LRR </italic> genes are upregulated in resistant Buseok under UV-B stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3"> 16 </xref> ). Plant NBS-LRR proteins can be divided into two major subfamilies based on the presence of <span class="gene">TIR</span> or CC motifs in their N-terminal domains (Tameling and Joosten, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr"> 2007 </xref> ; G&#x000f6;hre and Robatzek, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"> 2008 </xref> ). Similarly, dozens of <italic> TIR-NBS-LRR </italic> genes, but no <italic> CC-NBS-LRR </italic> s, are differentially expressed in <italic> A. thaliana </italic> under <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress (Prasch and Sonnewald, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr"> 2013 </xref> ). A surprising role for TIR-NBS-LRRs has been proposed in the sensing of red light (Faig&#x000f3;n-Soverna et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"> 2006 </xref> ). A mutant of the constitutive shade avoidance ( <italic> CSA1 </italic> ) gene in Arabidopsis is defective in red light-induced responses and produces a truncated protein with a structure similar to TIR.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We also observed increased accumulation of <italic> <span class="gene">HSP70</span> </italic> transcripts in response to UV-B stress in Buseok (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3 </xref> , Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"> 1 </xref> ; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3"> 16 </xref> ). Indeed, in Arabidopsis, HSPs and <span class="trait">heat</span> shock factors are upregulated in response to pathogen infection, abiotic stresses including UV, and wounding (Swindell et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"> 2007 </xref> ). HSPs including <span class="gene">HSP90</span> are thought to regulate the function of NBS-LRR (Belkhadir et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> 2004 </xref> ). Similarly, in soybean, <span class="gene">HSP70</span> is upregulated under high temperature stress (Ahsan et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"> 2010 </xref> ). Therefore, the highly expressed TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and HSPs under UV-B stress likely play important roles in the UV-B <span class="trait">resistance</span> response. Further studies on which and how genetic factors activate the transcription of <italic> TIR-NBS-LRR </italic> and <italic> HSP </italic> genes will be valuable for breeding of UV-B resistant soybean cultivars.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We have constructed a chimaeric gene consisting of the promoter of the soybean <span class="trait">heat</span> shock (hs) gene <span class="gene">Gmhsp17,</span> 6-L, the coding region of a hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene, and the termination sequence of the nopaline synthase (nos) gene. This gene fusion was introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Heat-inducible synthesis of mRNA was shown by northern hybridization, and translation of this RNA into a functional protein was indicated by plant growth on hygromycin-containing media in a temperature-dependent fashion. One hour incubation at 40 degrees C per day, applied for several weeks, was sufficient to express the resistant phenotype in transgenic plants containing the chimaeric hs-hpt gene. These data suggest that the hygromycin <span class="trait">resistance</span> gene is functional and faithfully controlled by the soybean hs promoter. The suitability of these transgenic plants for selection of mutations that alter the hs response is discussed.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						FLP site-specific recombinase was expressed in stably transformed tobacco and Arabidopsis. FLP-expressing tobacco lines were crossed with other transformed tobacco lines that contained a stably integrated FLP recognition target construct(s). The target construct consisted of two directly-oriented FLP recognition targets (FRTs), flanking a hygromycin <span class="trait">resistance</span> cassette located between a GUS coding region and an upstream 35S CaMV promoter. Excision of the hygromycin <span class="trait">resistance</span> cassette by FLP-mediated recombination between FRTs brings the GUS coding region under the transcriptional control of the CaMV 35S promoter. In the absence of FLP-mediated recombination, the GUS gene is transcriptionally silent. GUS activity was observed in the progeny of all crosses made between FLP recombinase-expressing and target-containing tobacco lines, but not in the selfs of parents. The predicted recombination product remaining after excision was confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. In Arabidopsis, inducible expression of FLP recombinase was achieved from the soybean <span class="gene">Gmhsp</span> 17.6L heat-shock promoter. Heat-shock induction of FLP expression in plants containing the target construct led to activation of constitutive GUS expression in a subset of cells, whose progeny, therefore, were GUS-positive. A variety of clonal sectors were produced in plants derived from seed that was heat-shocked during germination. The ability to control the timing of GUS activation was demonstrated by heat-shock of unopened flower heads which produced large sectors. It was concluded that heat-shock-induced expression of FLP recombinase provides a readily controllable method for generating marked clonal sectors in Arabidopsis, the size and distribution of which reflects the timing of applied heat-shock.

						As an approach for functional analysis of the soybean <italic> VQ </italic> genes, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpressed soybean <italic> VQ </italic> genes. The coding sequences of soybean Gm <italic> VQ </italic> genes including those highly responsive to stress-related phytohormones were subcloned behind the <italic> CaMV 35S </italic> promoter in a binary plant transformation vector and transformed into <italic> Arabidopsis </italic> plants. qRT-PCR was used to identify F0 transformant plants with elevated levels of transcripts for the transformed VQ gene. Due to the large number of transgenic lines for a large number of soybean VQ genes, our analysis of the transgenic plants was carried out in transgenic F1 lines with increased VQ gene expression and focused primarily on alterations in growth, development and disease <span class="trait">resistance.</span> Generally speaking, overexpression of a majority of the soybean VQ genes had no effects on growth or development of transgenic plants. However, altered growth was observed in transgenic plants overexpressing some of the soybean VQ genes. For example, transgenic plants with elevated transcript levels for Gm <italic> VQ19 </italic> or Gm <italic> VQ27 </italic> had narrower leaves than those of untransformed control plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"> Fig. 5A </xref> ). Transgenic plants overexpressing Gm <italic> VQ43 and <span class="gene">GmVQ62</span> </italic> flowered substantially earlier than control plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"> Fig. 5B </xref> ). Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmVQ37</span> had no significant effect on growth and flowering time but reduced seed setting, particularly on the first 10 or so siliques ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"> Fig. 5C </xref> ). The reduced seed setting appeared to be associated with shorter filaments of the stamen in transgenic plant flowers, which would reduce pollination.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A number of Arabidopsis VQ proteins have been show to play roles in plant <span class="trait">resistance</span> to necrotrophic pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21"> 21 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22"> 22 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23"> 23 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"> 24 </xref> . Therefore, we examined effects of overexpression of soybean VQ genes on response of transgenic Arabidopsis lines to <italic> B. cinerea </italic> . Using drop-inoculation assays of detached leaves, we observed that the lesion sizes of transgenic lines overexpressing <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ35</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ47</span> </italic> were substantially larger than those of control wild-type plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"> Fig. 6A </xref> ), suggesting that the two soybean VQ proteins act as negative regulators of plant defense against the necrotrophic pathogen. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ47</span> </italic> also displayed increased sensitivity to <span class="trait">heat</span> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"> Fig. 6B </xref> ). Thus, expression of a number of soybean VQ genes had various effects on plant growth, development and responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses.

						Deletion of four amino acid residues in the upstream submotif and abolishment of WRKY-binding activity of <span class="gene">GmVQ22</span> suggest that this is likely a loss-of-function mutation that might be advantageous and positively selected for during domestication. To examine this, we tried to express the wild soybean GsVQ22 in cultivated soybean to determine the effects on the transgenic soybean plants. For this purpose, we placed the <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> coding region under the control of the CaMV <italic> 35S </italic> promoter in the binary plant transformation vector pFGC5941. Using cotyledonary node method, we transformed the <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> expression construct into the soybean cultivar Heinong (HN) 37 and generated eight independent transgenic lines. However, six of the eight transgenic plants grew very poorly and didn&#x02019;t set seeds. The two remaining lines grew and set seeds largely normally and homozygous F3 progeny from the two independent lines were obtained. At early stages, homozygous F3 progeny from the transgenic <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> plants were largely normal when compared with nontransgenic control plants ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Supplemental Fig. 1 </xref> ). However, at older stages, the transgenic <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> plants displayed a slight but significant reduction in growth. At 4-week age, the average heights of the transgenic plants were about 10&#x02013;15% less than those of untransformed control plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10"> Fig. 10 </xref> ). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the <italic> VQ22 </italic> transcript levels in the two independent transgenic lines were elevated by 10&#x02013;20-fold when compared to those in untransformed HN37 plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11"> Fig. 11 </xref> ). To determine possible roles in stress tolerance, we also examined their responses to cold, <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses but failed to observe significantly altered phenotypes. Interestingly, we consistently observed that reduced growth of the transgenic plants was enhanced after cold treatment. In these experiments, we first subjected 12-days old transgenic and control plants to 48-hour cold treatment at 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. After the cold treatment, all the plants were moved back to a growth room at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for recovery of growth. This cold treatment significantly reduced the growth of nontransgenic control plants as indicated from the ~20% reduction in plant heights after 2-week recovery at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C when compared to those of unstressed plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10"> Fig. 10 </xref> ). Interestingly, the cold treatment reduced the growth of transgenic <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> plants to a larger extent as these plants displayed almost no increase in their height after 2 week recovery at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C after the cold treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10"> Fig. 10 </xref> ). As a result, the heights of the cold-treated transgenic <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> plants were only about 60% of cold-treated nontransgenic plants after recovery for 2 weeks at 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10"> Fig. 10 </xref> ). Thus, <italic> GsVQ22 </italic> had an inhibitory effect on soybean growth and this inhibitory effect was strengthened by cold treatment.

						Plant WRKY proteins have a predominant role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"> 3 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5"> 5 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35"> 35 </xref> . As their interacting proteins, plant VQ proteins are likely to be important regulators of plant disease <span class="trait">resistance</span> and stress tolerance as well. Molecular genetic analysis of a number of Arabidopsis VQ genes support the critical roles of VQ proteins in plant stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"> 10 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18"> 18 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19"> 19 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"> 24 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26"> 26 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28"> 28 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36"> 36 </xref> . In this study, we have provided further evidence for roles of VQ proteins in defense responses of soybean plants. First, expression of a substantial percentage of soybean VQ genes was responsive to a number of phytohormones associated with plant defense and stress responses ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"> Fig. 4 </xref> ). In particularly, a large number of soybean VQ genes were responsive to SA, an important defense signal in plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"> Fig. 4 </xref> ). Previously, a large percentage of Arabidopsis WRKY and VQ genes are responsive to SA as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"> 4 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18"> 18 </xref> . Survey of Arabidopsis WRKY and VQ gene promoters have further revealed strong enrichment of TTGAC W-box elements, suggesting extensive auto- and cross-regulation of Arabidopsis WRKY and VQ genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"> 4 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18"> 18 </xref> . Survey of soybean VQ gene promoters likewise revealed strong enrichment of W boxes as well (data not shown). These findings indicate that auto- and cross-regulation is a conversed regulatory mechanism of plant WRKY and VQ genes, leading to formation of both positive or negative feedback loops and, consequently, rapid induction or repression of the genes under stress conditions. Second, overexpression of both soybean <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ35</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ47</span> </italic> caused enhanced susceptibility of transgenic Arabidopsis plants to <italic> Botrytis </italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"> Fig. 6A </xref> ). Overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmVQ47</span> </italic> also reduced <span class="trait">heat</span> tolerance of transgenic plants ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"> Fig. 6B </xref> ). Similarly, Arabidopsis contains not only positive but also negative VQ regulators of plant stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10"> 10 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18"> 18 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19"> 19 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"> 24 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26"> 26 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28"> 28 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33"> 33 </xref> . The opposite roles of VQ proteins in plant stress responses could be at least in part mediated by their opposite effects on interacting WRKY proteins. Thus, while Arabidopsis SIB1/AtVQ23 proteins enhance the DNA-binding activity of the interacting AtWRKY33 protein, other VQ proteins may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of their interacting WRKY proteins. Furthermore, some Arabidopsis VQ proteins act as transcriptional activators while others function as transcriptional repressors in plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19"> 19 </xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28"> 28 </xref> . Therefore, a VQ protein could positively or negatively regulate the expression of the target genes of their interacting WRKY proteins by altering their DNA-binding and transcription-regulating activities. Coordinated action of both positive and negative VQ transcription regulators could potentially provide a mechanism for tight regulation and fine-tuning of genes associated with plant stress responses.

						For generating transgenic VQ overexpression lines, the full-length coding sequences for VQ genes were amplified using gene-specific primerers ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"> Supplemental Table 5 </xref> ). The amplified fragments were digested using appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into the plant transformation vector pFGC5941 containing the CaMV35S promoter. The fused plasmids were transformed into Col-0 wild-type plants using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral-dip procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57"> 57 </xref> .

						Bacillus megaterium NRRL B-1368 cells and spores were produced on Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) and Agar (TSA) containing 3.8 mug of aflatoxin B(1) per ml, analyzed for selected chemical constituents, and compared to cells and spores of B. megaterium produced on nontoxic Trypticase Soy Media. There was an initial 30% kill of cells after inoculation into toxic <span class="gene">TSB</span> and during the first 3.5 hr of incubation followed by a logarithmic growth phase in which the generation time was 75 min as compared to 20 min for the control culture. Chemical analyses revealed an increase in protein, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and ribonucleic acid (RNA) on both a per cell basis and a per cent dry weight basis when B. megaterium was grown in toxic TSB. There was a concurrent decrease in the total amounts of cellular protein, DNA, and RNA synthesized in toxic TSB. Amino acid analyses of control and test cell walls showed little, if any, difference in cell wall composition. About 97% sporulation of B. megaterium occurred after 3 days on nontoxic <span class="gene">TSA</span> although 6 days were required to attain 65% sporulation on toxic TSA. Germination of spores was not inhibited by 4.0 mug of aflatoxin per ml but outgrowth was.

						PhyR is an unusual type of response regulator consisting of a receiver domain and an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor-like domain. It was recently described as a master regulator of general stress response in Methylobacterium extorquens. Orthologues of this regulator are present in essentially all free-living Alphaproteobacteria. In most of them, <span class="gene">phyR</span> is genetically closely linked to a gene encoding an ECF sigma factor. Here, we investigate the role of these two regulators in the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110. Using deletion mutants and phenotypic assays, we showed that PhyR and the ECF sigma factor sigma(EcfG) are involved in <span class="trait">heat</span> shock and desiccation <span class="trait">resistance</span> upon carbon starvation. Both mutants had symbiotic defects on the plant hosts Glycine max (soybean) and Vigna radiata (mungbean). They induced fewer nodules than the wild type and these nodules were smaller, less pigmented, and their specific nitrogenase activity was drastically reduced 2 or 3 weeks after inoculation. Four weeks after infection, soybean nodule development caught up to a large extent whereas most mungbean nodules remained defective even 5 weeks after infection. Remarkably, both mutants triggered aberrant nodules on the different host plants with ectopically emerging roots. Microarray analysis revealed that PhyR and sigma(EcfG) control congruent regulons suggesting both regulators are part of the same signalling cascade. This finding was further substantiated by in vitro protein-protein interaction studies which are in line with a partner-switching mechanism controlling gene regulation triggered by phosphorylation of PhyR. The large number of genes of unknown function present in the PhyR/sigma(EcfG) regulon and the conspicuous symbiotic phenotype suggest that these regulators are involved in the Bradyrhizobium-legume interaction via yet undisclosed mechanisms.

						Soybean ( Glycine max L. Merrill) linkage group A2 contains a major <span class="trait">resistance</span> gene to the soybean cyst nematode ( Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) at the Rhg (4) locus near a gene encoding aspartokinase homoserine dehydrogenase (AK-HSDH) and also near the I locus affecting seed coat color. To identify clones related to this region of the genome, we used a PCR assay using primers designed from a gene encoding <span class="gene">AK-HSDH</span> to screen approximately 40,000 clones from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library constructed from genomic DNA of the susceptible cv. Williams 82. The identified BACs were screened with a second PCR assay using primers designed from DNA sequence associated with the I locus to confirm the location of the BACs. Only BAC <span class="gene">Gm_ISb001_056_G02</span> (56G2) was positive for both assays. BAC 56G2 contains several genes previously associated with stress or defense response including genes with high sequence similarity to those encoding chalcone synthase, glucosyl-transferase, a heat-shock transcription factor, a membrane-associated salt-inducible protein, adenosyl homocysteinase, a protein kinase, and a G10-like protein. The map contributes to our understanding of the organization of the soybean genome and to the completion of a physical map of the soybean genome. In addition, the genes identified provide landmarks to identify BAC clones near the Rhg (4) locus in resistant soybean genomic libraries and provide a foundation for comparison of soybean cyst nematode resistant and -susceptible DNA sequences in this region.

						Soybean lines lacking lipoxygenase (LOX) activity were compared with soybean lines having <span class="gene">LOX</span> activity for the ability to support growth and aflatoxin B1 production by the fungal seed pathogen Aspergillus flavus. Whole seeds, broken seeds, and heat-treated (autoclaved) whole seeds were compared. Broken seeds, irrespective of <span class="gene">LOX</span> presence, supported excellent fungal growth and the highest aflatoxin levels. Autoclaved whole seeds, with or without LOX, produced good fungal growth and aflatoxin levels approaching those of broken seeds. Whole soybean seeds supported sparse fungal growth and relatively low aflatoxin levels. There was no significant difference in aflatoxin production between whole soybean seeds either with or without LOX, although there did seem to be differences among the cultivars tested. The <span class="trait">heat</span> treatment eliminated <span class="gene">LOX</span> activity (in LOX+ lines), yet aflatoxin levels did not change substantially from the broken seed treatment. Broken soybean seeds possessed <span class="gene">LOX</span> activity (in LOX+ lines) and yet yielded the highest aflatoxin levels. The presence of active <span class="gene">LOX</span> did not seem to play the determinant role in the susceptibility of soybean seeds to fungal pathogens. Seed coat integrity and seed viability seem to be more important characteristics in soybean seed <span class="trait">resistance</span> to aflatoxin contamination. Soybean seeds lacking <span class="gene">LOX</span> seem safe from the threat of increased seed pathogen susceptibility.

						BACKGROUND: SKIP is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. It can regulate plant stress tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis. But the homolog of SKIP protein in soybean has been not reported up to now. RESULTS: In this study, the expression patterns of soybean GAMYB binding protein gene <span class="gene">(GmGBP1)</span> encoding a homolog of SKIP protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and different day lengths. The expression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> was induced by polyethyleneglycol 6000, NaCl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and <span class="trait">heat</span> stress. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> had transcriptional activity in C-terminal. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> could interact with R2R3 domain of <span class="gene">GmGAMYB1</span> in SKIP domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. In long-day (16 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette leaves; Suppression of AtSKIP in Arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes (CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY); Arabidopsis myb33 mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. In short-day (8 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> flowered later and showed a higher level of FLOWERING LOCUS C compared with wild type. When treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> enhanced the tolerances to <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses but reduced the tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In Arabidopsis, <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might positively regulate the flowering time by affecting CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and GAMYB directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in LDs, but <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might represse flowering by affecting FLOWERING LOCUS C and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE in autonomous pathway in SDs. <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might regulate the activity of ROS-eliminating to improve the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> but reduce the high-salinity tolerance.

						Flowering time plays key roles in plant development, plant adaptation to growing regions [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"> 1 </xref> ], crop <span class="trait">yield</span> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"> 3 </xref> ] and disease <span class="trait">resistance</span> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"> 4 </xref> ].

Genetic and molecular analyses has revealed that several distinct but linked signaling pathways regulate the flowering-time in response to light and temperature signals or to internal signals such as vernalization, autonomous pathways and gibberellin signal pathway [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"> 1 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"> 7 </xref> ]. Interaction of different signal transduction pathways before their convergence may allow a coordinated regulation of the activity of the respective pathways. The signals from these pathways are integrated through up-regulating the expression of one or more common target genes: <italic> FT </italic> , <italic> SOC1 </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">LFY</span> </italic> to determine when flowering.

All the <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs identified so far contained a SKIP domain with an S-N-W-K-N peptide signature and may have conserved basic functions, such as acting as a cofactor in transcription and splicing [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"> 15 </xref> ]. However, the derived or additional functions of the <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs varied among species. <italic> SKIP </italic> was an essential protein for pre-mRNA splicing in <italic> Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> ]. In <italic> Drosophila melanogaster </italic> , <italic> SKIP </italic> was involved in ecdysone-stimulated transcription [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"> 17 </xref> ] and known to be a coactivator in Notch [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"> 18 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"> 19 </xref> ]. In <italic> Caenorhabditis elegans </italic> , <italic> SKIP </italic> was an essential component of many RNA polymerase II transcription complexes and indispensable for <italic> C </italic> . <italic> elegans </italic> development [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref> ]. In <italic> Hordeum vulgare L </italic> ., <italic> SKIP </italic> could interact with <italic> GAMYB </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> ]. In <italic> Oryza sativa L </italic> ., <italic> OsSKIPa </italic> could positively modulate cell viability and stress tolerance [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> ]. <italic> AtSKIP </italic> functions as not only a positive regulator and putative potential transcription factor in the abiotic stress signaling pathway in Arabidopsis [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ], but also a component of the spliceosome linking alternative splicing and the circadian clock in Arabidopsis [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"> 24 </xref> ]. However, there has been no report on the identification of <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs in soybean and on their functions in the regulation of flowering time in any species so far.

						<bold> Expression patterns of </bold> <bold> <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> </bold> <bold> in soybean. </bold> ( <bold> A </bold> , <bold> B </bold> , <bold> C </bold> , <bold> D </bold> and <bold> E </bold> ) Expression level of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> in leaf of soybean treated with 100&#x003bc;mol ABA, 200mM NaCl, 100&#x003bc;mol GA, 8% PEG6000 and <span class="trait">heat</span> stress respectively. ( <bold> F </bold> ) Tissue-specific expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> in LDs and SDs. Tissues tested were root (RO), stem (ST), leaf (LE), trifoliate leaf (TL), flower bud (FB), pod (PO) and immature seed (IS).

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Since <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> was up-regulated by stresses and stress-related phytohormones, <italic> Arabidopsis thaliana </italic> plants, containing extra copies of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> gene, was produced to investigate whether overexpression of this gene could enhance stress tolerance. The transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR with homolog-specific primers (data not shown). In the <span class="gene">MS</span> medium containing ABA (1 and 3 &#x003bc;M), the germination rates of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants were both reduced compared to WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> A), indicating that ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> could increase the growth-suppression effect of ABA and <italic> AtSKIP </italic> might have the ability of reducing the negative effect of ABA. In the <span class="gene">MS</span> medium containing NaCl (150 and 200 mM), the germination rates of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants were also lower than the WT plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> C), suggesting that <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> decreased salt tolerance and <italic> AtSKIP </italic> improved the ability to salt tolerance. However, the germination rates of the three plants under 300 mM mannitol showed no difference (data not shown). A further study was performed to detect the stress tolerance of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> . When 20 days old plants growing in soil under SDs were treated with <span class="trait">drought</span> condition (no watering for 7 days), nearly all of the <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants were recovered at 3 days after re-watering, whereas only 40-60% of WT plants and none of <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants were recovered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> B). The root lengths of both Gm <italic> GBP1 </italic> -ox and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants were shorter than that of WT plants in the <span class="gene">MS</span> medium treated with 150 mM NaCl for 10 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> D); The <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants treated with 200 mM NaCl for 10 days under LDs were nearly dead, while 80-90% of WT plants survived (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> D).

						<span class="trait">Heat</span> tolerance experiment revealed that <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> might improve <span class="trait">heat</span> tolerance of Arabidopsis plants with ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> . 7days old plants of transgenic Arabidopsis, treated with 37&#x000b0;C for 5 days, exhibited symptom of flagged leaves, but WT and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants showed more serious symptom with whitened leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> E: a, b and c). Furthermore, WT and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants of 15days old showed more whitened leaves, even dead after treated with 37&#x000b0;C for 8 days, whereas <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants showed more vital (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> E: d, e and f).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants had a higher Superoxide dismutase (SOD) level than both <italic> atskip </italic> -i and WT plants under <span class="trait">heat</span> or <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants was much lower than both <italic> atskip </italic> -i and WT plants, indicating that the ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> in Arabidopsis might enhance the <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance. However, the highest MDA level and the lowest SOD level of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants implied the reduced salt tolerance in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -transgenic Arabidopsis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"> 5 </xref> F).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To gain further insight into the mechanism of the altered stress <span class="trait">resistance</span> of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants, transcript levels of 8 stress-responsive genes [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"> 25 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"> 28 </xref> ] were assayed in the <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox, <italic> atskip </italic> -i and WT plants under normal and stress conditions. The expression levels of all the 8 genes in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox were higher than WT and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ). Moreover, <italic> ZAT7 </italic> , <italic> ZAT12 </italic> , <italic> HSFA1b </italic> and <italic> HSFA2 </italic> showed significantly higher expression level in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox than in WT and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants after treated with 42C for 2h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ), <italic> MYB2 </italic> , <italic> <span class="gene">MYB96</span> </italic> , <italic> MYC2 </italic> , <italic> RD26 </italic> and <italic> ZAT12 </italic> were up-regulated after <span class="trait">drought</span> for 7days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ). These results suggested that overexpression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> can increase the transcript levels of some stress-resistance genes under <span class="trait">drought</span> or <span class="trait">heat</span> stress conditions, thus improving the <span class="trait">drought</span> or <span class="trait">heat</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> of the transgenic plants. However, the expression levels of <italic> RD26 </italic> , <italic> ZAT7 </italic> and <italic> ZAT12 </italic> in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants were significantly lower than WT and <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants after treated with 200 mM NaCl for 7 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6"> 6 </xref> ), indicating that <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> might reduce the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to high salinity.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Drought</span> and high-salinity repressed plant growth and limited seed <span class="trait">yield.</span> <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs in Arabidopsis and rice could improve the tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> and high-salinity [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ]. In this study, the ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> in Arabidopsis could enhance the tolerance to <span class="trait">drought.</span> However, <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants showed a salt-sensitive appearance, although <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants reduced the tolerance to salt as previous report [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ]. Thus, the tolerance of <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs to salt might be not conserved in plant. <span class="trait">Heat,</span> one of serious environmental stresses, affected the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. There was no report about <span class="trait">heat</span> tolerance of <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs previously. Our result showed that <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants increased the tolerance to <span class="trait">heat</span> whereas <italic> atskip </italic> -i plants reduced the tolerance to <span class="trait">heat,</span> indicating that <italic> AtSKIP </italic> has the ability of <span class="trait">heat</span> tolerance.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be induced by abiotic stresses, and over-accumulation of ROS could lead to cell damage and even death. SOD was used to eliminate ROS, and MDA was the intermediate product during the elimination of ROS [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"> 29 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"> 30 </xref> ]. In this study, the raised content of ROS in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants treated with salinity and the decreased content of ROS in <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants treated with <span class="trait">heat</span> (or <span class="trait">drought)</span> indicated that the altered stress tolerance of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> -ox plants may be partially due to the regulation of the activity of ROS-eliminating.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<italic> SKIP </italic> had a conserved SKIP domain with an S-N-W-K-N peptide signature, and was considered as a cofactor for transcription regulation in all eukaryotes so far. However, the derived or additional functions of the <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs varied among species. Transgenic rice that overexpressed <italic> OsSKIPa </italic> exhibited stress tolerances (abscisic acid, salt, mannitol) at both seedling and reproductive stages [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> ]. Overexpression of the <italic> AtSKIP </italic> gene in Arabidopsis modulated the induction of salt tolerance, dehydration <span class="trait">resistance</span> and insensitivity towards abscisic acid under stress conditions [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ]; However, ectopic expression of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> in Arabidopsis reduced tolerance to NaCl, but increased tolerance to <span class="trait">drought</span> and <span class="trait">heat</span> in this study.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant <italic> SKIPs </italic> were divided into four groups based on the <italic> SKIP </italic> sequences by phylogenetic tree (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"> 1 </xref> D). The different groups among <italic> OsSKIP </italic> , <italic> AtSKIP </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> indicated the diversity of their functions. <italic> SKIP </italic> could be induced by various abiotic stresses, phytohormones treatments and day-length, but the expression patterns of <italic> SKIP </italic> varied among rice, Arabidopsis and soybean [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ]. The transcriptional levels of <italic> OsSKIP </italic> , <italic> AtSKIP </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> were all up-regulated by ABA, NaCl and <span class="trait">drought</span> (PEG6000 or mannitol), but had different scales. <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> could be induced by day-length and <span class="trait">heat,</span> but no related report for <italic> OsSKIP </italic> and <italic> AtSKIP </italic> in rice and Arabidopsis. The various functions of <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs might be also owing to the diversification of <italic> SKIP </italic> -interacting proteins <italic> SIP </italic> s. Previous studies showed that the <italic> SKIP </italic> homologs, <italic> PRP45 </italic> (yeast), <italic> BX42 </italic> ( <italic> Drosophila </italic> ), <italic> CeSKIP </italic> ( <italic> C </italic> . <italic> elegans </italic> ), <italic> HvSKIP </italic> (barely) and <italic> OsSKIP </italic> (rice) had 34, 13, 5, 1 and 35 interacted proteins, respectively [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"> 16 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"> 20 </xref> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"> 40 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"> 41 </xref> ]. Nevertheless, few <italic> SIP </italic> s could match each other among species. For example, both <italic> HvSKIP </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> interacted with <italic> GAMYB </italic> but <italic> OsGAMYB </italic> was not included in the 35 <italic> OsSIP </italic> s [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"> 21 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> ]. All the data indicated that <italic> SKIP </italic> might participate in distinct functions through the interaction with diverse proteins.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> ,as a homolog of <italic> SKIP </italic> in soybean, not only regulates plant flowering time but also alters plant <span class="trait">resistance</span> to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis. Such a flowering study about SKIP homolog in plant has no report so far. Although both <italic> OsSKIP </italic> and AtSKIP could improve plant tolerance to high salinity and <span class="trait">drought</span> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"> 22 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"> 23 </xref> ], <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> might improve plant tolerance to <span class="trait">heat</span> and <span class="trait">drought,</span> but reduce the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to high salinity. The flowering and stress related functions of <italic> <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> </italic> might be used to develop soybean cultivars with the adaptability to broad grow regions and environment.
