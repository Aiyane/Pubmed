				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Under non-saline field conditions, no significant differences were observed for <span class="trait">yield</span> related traits within each pair of NIL-T and NIL-S lines, indicating there was no <span class="trait">yield</span> penalty for having the <span class="gene">GmSALT3</span> gene.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In contrast, under saline field conditions the NIL-T lines had significantly greater plant <span class="trait">seed</span> weight and 100-seed weight than the corresponding NIL-S lines, meaning <span class="gene">GmSALT3</span> conferred a <span class="trait">yield</span> advantage to soybean plants in salinized fields.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our results indicated that <span class="gene">GmSALT3</span> mediated regulation of both Na+ and Cl- accumulation in soybean, and contributes to improved soybean <span class="trait">yield</span> through maintaining a higher <span class="trait">seed</span> weight under saline stress.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Prior results showed that when <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> was overexpressed in transgenic soybean hairy roots, <span class="trait">resistance</span> is conferred against soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Among transgenic lines, <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> expression in roots was positively associated with SCN <span class="trait">resistance</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We hypothesize that <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> expression affects salicylic acid biosynthesis, which, in turn, attenuates SCN development, without negative consequences to soybean <span class="trait">yield</span> or other morphological traits.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Thus, we conclude that <span class="gene">GmSAMT1</span> overexpression confers broad <span class="trait">resistance</span> to multiple SCN races, which would be potentially applicable to commercial production.

						Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping for <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> revealed two eQTLs, one of which coincided with both the physical location of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> and a QTL associated with <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span>.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Genetic modifications <span class="gene">(GMO)</span> to soybean have become inevitable on two fronts, both quality and <span class="trait">yield</span> will need to improve to meet increasing global demand.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To ensure the safety of the crop for consumers it is important to determine the natural variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> protein constituents as well as any unintended changes that may occur in the <span class="gene">GMO</span> as a result of genetic modification.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Understanding the natural variation of <span class="trait">seed</span> proteins in wild and cultivated soybeans that have been used in conventional soybean breeding programs is critical for determining unintended protein expression in <span class="gene">GMO</span> soybeans.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used previously to map soybean insect <span class="trait">resistance</span> (SIR) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a'Cobb' X PI 229358 population, and subsequently used to create near-isogenic lines (NILs) with <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL i n a 'Benning' genetic background.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate linkage drag for <span class="trait">seed</span> <span class="trait">yield</span> by using Benning-derived NILs selected for SIRQTL-M, SIRQTL-H, and SIRQTL-G; 2) assess the amount of PI 229358 genome surrounding the <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL in each Benning NIL; and 3) evaluate the individual effects these three QTLs on antibiosis and antixenosis to corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker).
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Yield</span> data collected in five environments indicated that a significant <span class="trait">yield</span> reduction is associated with SIRQTL-G compared with NILs without <span class="gene">SIR</span> QTL.

					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The presence of <span class="gene">HPS</span> on the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface is a trait that cosegregates with the <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre determinant <italic> B </italic> [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> ]
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						These facts along with other evidence suggest that <span class="gene">HPS</span> can mediate the attachment of endocarp tissues to the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface and thereby affect the <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The occurrence of relatively large amounts of <span class="gene">HPS</span> on the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface results in the release of aerosols containing the protein during <span class="trait">seed</span> handling
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Finally, we propose that changes in <italic> Hps </italic> gene copy number modulate <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein expression levels and <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre phenotypes
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Past studies have pointed to a role for <span class="gene">HPS</span> in the control of <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre in soybean cultivars [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> ]
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This relationship was not apparent for bloom phenotypes, an exception that has been noted in past studies that correlated the occurrence of <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein to <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> ]
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This result was expected because past studies have shown that <italic> B </italic> cosegregates with the presence of <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein on the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, and with a DNA marker derived from the <italic> Hps </italic> cDNA sequence [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> ]
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Variation in <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein levels expressed in the endocarp could then account for the variable pattern of attachment of this tissue to the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, and the resulting <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre phenotypes
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						From these results, together with past studies on the occurrence and inheritance of the <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein, we developed a model to account for variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre controlled by the <italic> B </italic> locus
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Variable <span class="gene">HPS</span> expression in the endocarp likewise generates variation in the quantity and pattern of attachment of the endocarp to the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, thereby affecting the <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre

					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Finally, we propose that changes in <italic> Hps </italic> gene copy number modulate <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein expression levels and <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre phenotypes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Past studies have pointed to a role for <span class="gene">HPS</span> in the control of <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre in soybean cultivars [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This relationship was not apparent for bloom phenotypes, an exception that has been noted in past studies that correlated the occurrence of <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein to <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"> 5 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						This result was expected because past studies have shown that <italic> B </italic> cosegregates with the presence of <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein on the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, and with a DNA marker derived from the <italic> Hps </italic> cDNA sequence [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"> 2 </xref> ].
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Variation in <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein levels expressed in the endocarp could then account for the variable pattern of attachment of this tissue to the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, and the resulting <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre phenotypes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						From these results, together with past studies on the occurrence and inheritance of the <span class="gene">HPS</span> protein, we developed a model to account for variation in <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre controlled by the <italic> B </italic> locus.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Variable <span class="gene">HPS</span> expression in the endocarp likewise generates variation in the quantity and pattern of attachment of the endocarp to the <span class="trait">seed</span> surface, thereby affecting the <span class="trait">seed</span> lustre.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Mutations in <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> </italic> genes have been reported to increase <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic acid content
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Using gel-based TILLING, no mutant was identified within the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> </italic> , however, a forward genetic approach based on gas chromatography screening identified five soybean lines with high oleic acid <span class="trait">seed</span> content
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In particular, <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-1A</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-1B</span> </italic> present the <span class="trait">seed</span> specific isoforms in soybean with very high expression levels in the seeds (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"> S1 </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In order to identify possible mutations in the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> genes and to test the direct correlation between the <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2</span> </italic> mutations and <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic acid phenotype alterations, the genomic sequences of the two <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> </italic> isoforms of the three mutants (F1274, F1284, and F812) and the wild type Forrest were analyzed by target sequencing
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our mutational analysis demonstrated that only mutations within <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> members affect <span class="trait">seed</span> oleic acid content in soybean
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In addition, data from RNAseq shows that the two microsomal <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> </italic> desaturases <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> </italic> were mainly expressed in developing seeds and constituted the <span class="trait">seed</span> specific paralogs in the soybean genome (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"> S1 </xref> )
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						While <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2B</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2C</span> </italic> were found to display ubiquitous expression in all the vegetative tissues of the soybean plant, <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2D</span> </italic> was expressed in the flower, <span class="trait">seed,</span> and nodule, while <italic> <span class="gene">GmFAD2-2E</span> </italic> expression was exclusively confined to the pod and <span class="trait">seed</span> with low levels of expression
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The figure shows that both <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1A</span> </italic> and <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1B</span> </italic> encode the <span class="trait">seed</span> specific paralogs of <italic> <span class="gene">FAD2-1</span> </italic> , while <italic> FAD2-2B </italic> and <italic> FAD2-2C </italic> paralogs are expressed in the vegetative tissues and the development of seeds
