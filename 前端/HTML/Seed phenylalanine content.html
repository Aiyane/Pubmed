				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In both experiments, the use of cysteine, only in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and in both <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> and catalase.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Also in both experiments, the use of <span class="trait">phenylalanine</span> increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> when the application was carried out as foliar application or both in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In the field experiment, the application of glutamate led to an increase in the activity of the catalase and <span class="gene">PAL</span> enzymes for <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A comparative analysis of genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in RCAT Angora (high <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) and Harovinton (low <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) revealed that <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 were expressed at significantly greater level in RCAT Angora than in Harovinton.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Our study provides a detailed transcriptome profiling of soybean embryos during development and indicates that differences in the level of <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoids between these two cultivars could be as a result of differential expression of <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 during late stages of <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The highest level of expression of <span class="gene">IFS1</span> was observed in the root and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, while <span class="gene">IFS2</span> was most highly expressed in embryos and pods, and in elicitor-treated or pathogen-challenged tissues.
