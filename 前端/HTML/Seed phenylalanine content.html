						Isoflavonoids are biologically active natural products that accumulate in soybean seeds during development. The amount of isoflavonoids present in soybean <span class="trait">seed</span> is variable, depending on genetic and environmental factors that are not fully understood. Experiments were conducted to determine whether isoflavonoids are synthesized within <span class="trait">seed</span> tissues during development, or made in other plant organs and transported to the seeds where they accumulate. An analysis of isoflavonoids by HPLC detected the compounds in all organs of soybean plant, but the amount of isoflavonoids present varied depending on the tissue and developmental stage. The greatest concentrations were found in mature seeds and leaves. The 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase genes <span class="gene">IFS1</span> and <span class="gene">IFS2</span> were studied to determine their pattern of expression in different tissues and developmental stages. The highest level of expression of <span class="gene">IFS1</span> was observed in the root and <span class="trait">seed</span> coat, while <span class="gene">IFS2</span> was most highly expressed in embryos and pods, and in elicitor-treated or pathogen-challenged tissues. Incorporation of radiolabel into isoflavonoids was observed when developing embryos and other plant organs were fed with [(14)C]phenylalanine. Embryos excised from developing soybean seeds also accumulated isoflavonoids from a synthetic medium. A maternal effect on <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid <span class="trait">content</span> was noted in reciprocal crosses between soybean cultivars that differ in <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoids. From these results, we propose that developing soybean embryos have an ability to synthesize isoflavonoids de novo, but that transport from maternal tissues may in part contribute to the accumulation of these natural products in the <span class="trait">seed.</span>

						We have used cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression during embryo development in soybean (Glycine max) and to compare gene expression profiles of two soybean cultivars that differ in <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid <span class="trait">content.</span> The analysis identified 5,910 genes that were differentially expressed in both soybean cultivars grown at two different locations for two consecutive years in one of the five different stages of embryo development. An ANOVA analysis with P value &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01 indicated that gene expression changes due to environmental factors are greater than those due to cultivar differences. Most changes in gene expression occurred at the stages when the embryos were at 30 or 70 d after pollination. A significantly larger fraction of genes (48.5%) was expressed throughout the development and showed little or no change in expression. Transcript accumulation for genes related to the biosynthesis of storage components in soybean embryos showed several unique temporal expressions. Expression patterns of several genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis, such as <span class="trait">Phenylalanine</span> Ammonia-Lyase, Chalcone Synthase (CHS) 7, CHS8, and Isoflavone Synthase2, were higher at 70 d after pollination in both the cultivars. Thus, expression of these genes coincides with the onset of accumulation of isoflavonoids in the embryos. A comparative analysis of genes involved in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in RCAT Angora (high <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) and Harovinton (low <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoid cultivar) revealed that <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 were expressed at significantly greater level in RCAT Angora than in Harovinton. Our study provides a detailed transcriptome profiling of soybean embryos during development and indicates that differences in the level of <span class="trait">seed</span> isoflavonoids between these two cultivars could be as a result of differential expression of <span class="gene">CHS7</span> and CHS8 during late stages of <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In recent years, the application of natural substances on crops has been intensified in order to increase the <span class="trait">resistance</span> and <span class="trait">yield</span> of the soybean crop. Among these products are included plant biostimulants that may contain algae extracts, amino acids, and plant regulators in their composition. However, there is little information on the isolated effect of each of these constituents. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the application of isolated amino acids on the antioxidant metabolism of the soybean crop. Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and in the field with the application of the amino acids glutamate, <span class="trait">phenylalanine,</span> cysteine, glycine in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment, and foliar application at V4 growth stage. Antioxidant metabolism constituents evaluated were superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide <span class="trait">content,</span> proline, and lipid peroxidation. In addition, <span class="trait">resistance</span> enzymes as polyphenol oxidase and <span class="trait">phenylalanine</span> ammonia-lyase (PAL) were evaluated. In both experiments, the use of cysteine, only in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and in both <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> and catalase. Also in both experiments, the use of <span class="trait">phenylalanine</span> increased the activity of the enzyme <span class="gene">PAL</span> when the application was carried out as foliar application or both in <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. In the field experiment, the application of glutamate led to an increase in the activity of the catalase and <span class="gene">PAL</span> enzymes for <span class="trait">seed</span> treatment and foliar application. The use of the set of amino acids was only efficient in foliar application, which led to a greater activity of the enzymes peroxidase, PAL, and polyphenol oxidase. The other enzymes as well as lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide presented different results according to the experiment. Therefore, glutamate, cysteine, <span class="trait">phenylalanine,</span> and glycine can act as signaling amino acids in soybean plants, since small doses are enough to increase the activity of the antioxidant enzymes.
