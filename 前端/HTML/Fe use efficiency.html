						Phosphorus (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize P with high <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> To investigate the effects of iron (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of <span class="trait">Fe</span> in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different P <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing <span class="trait">Fe</span> concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The <span class="trait">Fe</span> reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total <span class="trait">Fe</span> uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more iron was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="trait">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by <span class="trait">Fe</span> deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased <span class="trait">Fe</span> concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active <span class="trait">Fe</span> in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable <span class="trait">Fe</span> concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Lectins are known to bind to the intestinal brush border membrane and induce antinutritional effects such as disruption of the brush border membrane (BBM) and reduced nutrient digestibility in laboratory rodents. Because soybean lectin (SBL) is usually present in poult starter diets, 2 similar experiments with starting turkey poults were conducted to investigate the effects of purified SBL on growth performance and nutrient digestibility. Experimental diets were a corn starch-casein based control (lectin-free) semipurified diet (PD), semipurified diets containing 0.024 or 0.048% soybean lectin (PDL, PDH), and a corn-soybean meal diet (SBD). Experimental diets were fed from hatch to 14 d. Antibodies specific for soybean lectin were detected in the serum of poults fed the PDL and <span class="gene">PDH</span> diets, implying that the SBL in these diets remained active in the digestive tract. Poults fed the control PD or SBD grew equally well. The 0.024% SBL level in PDL had no significant detrimental effect on any parameters assessed in the 2 experiments. In contrast, the 0.048% SBL level in the <span class="gene">PDH</span> gave inconsistent results for feed <span class="trait">efficiency</span> <span class="trait">(FE)</span> and brush border enzyme levels. For instance, on d 6 in experiment 2, poults fed the <span class="gene">PDH</span> had poorer <span class="trait">FE</span> (P &lt; 0.05) compared with the control PD treatment, but had similar <span class="trait">FE</span> to poults fed the PD in experiment 1. In conclusion, SBL present at levels up to 0.024% of the diet would not cause antinutritional effect in turkey poults up to 2 wk of age.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including phosphorus (P), iron <span class="trait">(Fe)</span> and water deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::GmEXPB2-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and P uptake, especially at low P levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and P uptake at both low and high P levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by <span class="trait">Fe</span> and mild water deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including P, <span class="trait">Fe</span> and water deficiency. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and P responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop P uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.
