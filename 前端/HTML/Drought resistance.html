				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						When treated with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of <span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> enhanced the tolerances to heat and <span class="trait">drought</span> stresses but reduced the tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several stress-related genes.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">GmGBP1</span> might regulate the activity of ROS-eliminating to improve the <span class="trait">resistance</span> to heat and <span class="trait">drought</span> but reduce the high-salinity tolerance.

						The activity of the <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> promoter <span class="gene">(GmERF5P)</span> was upregulated in tobacco leaves with ET, ABA, Phytophthora nicotianae, salt, and <span class="trait">drought</span> treatments, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmERF5</span> could be involved not only in the induced defence response but also in the ABA-mediated pathway of salt and <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Expression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> was induced by treatments with high salinity, <span class="trait">drought,</span> abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV), whereas there was no significant <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> mRNA accumulation under cold stress treatment.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Ectopic expression of the <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> gene in transgenic tobacco plants induced the expression of some PR genes and enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> against infection by Ralstonia solanacearum, Alternaria alternata, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and gave tolerance to high salinity and dehydration stresses.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> in transgenic tobacco led to higher levels of free proline and soluble carbohydrates compared to wild-type plants under <span class="trait">drought</span> conditions.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Despite the knowledge available regarding NAC protein function, an extensive study on the possible use of <span class="gene">GmNACs</span> in developing soybean cultivars with superior <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance is yet to be done.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						CONCLUSION: The study allowed for the identification of eight <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes that could be focused upon in future attempts to develop superior soybean varieties, particularly in terms of <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span>.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study we identified a R2R3-MYB TF in soybean (Glycine max), denoted <span class="gene">GmMYB84,</span> which contributes to <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span>.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Expression of <span class="gene">GmMYB84</span> was induced by <span class="trait">drought,</span> salt stress, H2O2 and ABA.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Compared with the wild type (WT), <span class="gene">GmMYB84-overexpressing</span> soybean mutants (OE lines) exhibited enhanced <span class="trait">drought</span> <span class="trait">resistance</span> with a higher survival rate, longer primary root length, greater proline and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, higher antioxidant enzyme activities [peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], a lower dehydration rate and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Based on this evidence, we propose a model for how <span class="gene">GmMYB84,</span> H2O2 and antioxidant enzymes work together to control root growth under both optimal and <span class="trait">drought</span> stress conditions.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In this study, using protein sequence similarity searches, we identified 17 soybean RBOHs <span class="gene">(GmRBOHs)</span> and studied their contribution to SSR disease development, <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerance and nodulation.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI</span> using Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) resulted in enhanced <span class="trait">resistance</span> to S.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Coincidently, <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI-silenced</span> plants were also found to be <span class="trait">drought</span> tolerant, but showed a reduced capacity to form nodules.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expressions of <span class="gene">GmYABBY3,</span> <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> and <span class="gene">GmYABBY16</span> were more highly sensitive in <span class="trait">drought,</span> NaCl and ABA stresses.
					</p>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						When seedlings were grown in soil, the survival rates of wild type were higher than those of transgenic plants under both PEG and NaCl treatment, which indicated that <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> may be a negatively regulator in plant resistances to <span class="trait">drought</span> and salt stresses.
