						Most soybean cultivars possess broad leaflets; however, a recessive allele on the <span class="gene">Ln</span> locus is known to cause the alteration of broad to narrow leaflets. The recessive allele ln has also been considered to increase the number of seeds per pod (NSP) and has the potential to improve <span class="trait">yield.</span> Recently, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> <span class="gene">(Glyma20g25000),</span> a gene controlling Ln, has been shown to complement leaf shape and silique length in Arabidopsis mutants. However, whether <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> is responsible for those traits in soybean is not yet known. In this study, we investigated the pleiotropic effect of soybean <span class="gene">Ln</span> gene on <span class="trait">leaflet</span> shape and NSP by using two independent soybean <span class="gene">Gm-jag1</span> mutants and four ln near isogenic lines (NILs). The <span class="trait">leaflet</span> shape was evaluated using a leaf image analysis software, SmartLeaf, which was customized from SmartGrain. The leaflets of both the <span class="gene">Gm-jag1</span> mutants were longer and narrower than those of the wild-type plants. Interestingly, the image analysis results clarified that the perimeter of the mutant leaflets did not change, although their <span class="trait">leaflet</span> <span class="trait">area</span> decreased. Furthermore, one mutant line with narrow leaflets showed significantly higher NSP than that in the wild (or Ln) genotype, indicating that soybean <span class="gene">Ln</span> gene pleiotropically controls <span class="trait">leaflet</span> shape and NSP.

						KEY MESSAGE: A high-resolution genetic map that was constructed for the Lf1 -residing region will provide valuable information for map-based cloning and genetic improvement efforts in soybean. Changes in leaf architecture as photosynthesis factories remain a major challenge for the improvement of crop productivity. Unlike most soybeans, which have compound leaves comprising three leaflets, the soybean Lf1 mutant has a high frequency of compound leaves with five leaflets in a partially dominant manner. Here, we generated a fine genetic map to determine the genetic basis of this multifoliolate leaf trait. A five-leaflet variant Dusam was found in a recently collected landrace cultivar. Phenotypic data were collected from the F2 population of a cross between the Dusam and three-leaflet cultivar V94-5152. The mapping results generated using public markers indicated that the five-leaflet determining gene in Dusam is an allele of the previously studied Lf1 gene on chromosome 8. A high-resolution map delimited the genomic region controlling the <span class="trait">leaflet</span> number trait to a sequence length of 49 kb. <span class="gene">AP2</span> domain-containing <span class="gene">Glyma.08g281900</span> annotated in this 49 kb region appeared to be a strong candidate for the Lf1-encoding gene, as members of the AP2-type transcription factor family regulate lateral organ development. Dusam additionally exhibits visually distinct phenotypes for shattering and seed-coat cracking traits. However, the two traits were clearly unlinked to the Lf1 gene in our mapping population. Interestingly, the mapping results suggest that the Lf1 gene most likely exerts a pleiotropic effect on the number of seeds per pod. Thus, our results provide a strong foundation towards the cloning of this compound leaf development gene and marker-assisted selection of the seeds per pod trait.

						Narrow <span class="trait">leaflet</span> cultivars tend to have more seeds per pod than broad <span class="trait">leaflet</span> cultivars in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], which suggests that the leaflet-shape trait locus is tightly linked to or cosegregates with the trait locus controlling the number of seeds per pod (NSPP). Here, we attempted to further elucidate the relationship between <span class="trait">leaflet</span> shape and NSPP. A BC(3)F(2) population from a cross between the 'Sowon' (narrow leaflets and high NSPP) and 'V94-5152' (broad leaflets and low NSPP) variants was used. The results of the molecular genetic analyses indicated that, although the NSPP characteristic, in particular, the occurrence of 4-seeded pods, is governed by additional modifying genes that are likely present in Sowon, the two traits cosegregate in the BC(3)F(2) population. The mapping results generated using public markers demonstrated that the narrow leaflet-determining gene in Sowon is an allele of the previously highly studied ln gene on chromosome 20. A high-resolution map delimited the genomic region controlling both the <span class="trait">leaflet</span> shape and NSPP traits to a sequence length of 66 kb, corresponding to 0.7 cM. Among the three genes annotated in this 66 kb region, <span class="gene">Glyma20g25000.1</span> appeared to be a good candidate for the Ln-encoding gene, owing to its 47.8% homology with the protein encoding for the JAGGED gene that regulates lateral organ development in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results suggested that phenotypic variations for narrow <span class="trait">leaflet</span> and NSPP are predominantly from the pleiotropic effects of the ln gene. Thus, our results should provide a molecular framework for soybean breeding programs with the objective of improving soybean <span class="trait">yield.</span>
