						Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from <span class="trait">glucose</span> 6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate <span class="gene">(GmMIPS1)</span> gene. We have observed an absence of <span class="trait">seed</span> development in lines in which the presence of <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic reduction of phytate (InsP6) <span class="trait">content</span> was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between <span class="gene">GmMIPS1</span> gene expression and <span class="trait">seed</span> development.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is one of most important oil crops and a significant increase in lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in soybean seeds would facilitate vegetable oil production in the world. Although the pathways for lipid biosynthesis in higher plants have been uncovered, our understanding of regulatory mechanism controlling lipid accumulation is still limited. In this study, we identified 87 transcription factor genes with a higher abundance at the stage of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds. One of these genes, <span class="gene">GmbZIP123,</span> was selected to further study its function in regulation of lipid accumulation. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> enhanced lipid <span class="trait">content</span> in the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgene promoted expression of two sucrose transporter genes (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertase genes (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6) by binding directly to the promoters of these genes. Consistently, the cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were all enhanced in siliques of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgenic plants. Higher levels of <span class="trait">glucose,</span> fructose, and sucrose were also found in seeds of <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> transgenic plants. These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> may participate in regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds by controlling sugar transport into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues. This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for lipid accumulation in seeds and may facilitate improvements in oil production in soybean and other oil crops through genetic manipulation of the <span class="gene">GmbZIP123</span> gene.
