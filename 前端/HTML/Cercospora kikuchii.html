					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Cercospora</span> leaf blight (CLB) of soybean, caused by <span class="trait">Cercospora</span> <span class="trait">kikuchii,</span> is a serious disease in the southern United States. A sensitive TaqMan probe-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was developed to specifically detect and quantify C. <span class="trait">kikuchii</span> in naturally infected soybean plants. The sensitivity was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to about 34 copies of genome of C. <span class="trait">kikuchii.</span> Using this qPCR assay, we documented a very long latent infection period for C. <span class="trait">kikuchii</span> in soybean leaves beginning at the <span class="gene">V3</span> growth stage (as early as 22 days after planting). The levels of biomass of C. <span class="trait">kikuchii</span> remained low until R1, and a rapid increase was detected from the R2/R3 to R4/R5 growth stages shortly before the appearance of symptoms at R6. The efficacy of various fungicide regimens under field conditions also was evaluated over a 3-year period using this qPCR method. Our results showed that multiple fungicide applications beginning at R1 until late reproductive stages suppressed the development of C. <span class="trait">kikuchii</span> in leaves and delayed symptom expression. Different fungicide chemistries also had differential effects on the amount of latent infection and symptom expression during late reproductive growth stages.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] plants were exposed to three temperature regimens during seed development to investigate the effect of temperature on the expression of eight defense-related genes and the accumulation of two fungal pathogens in inoculated seeds. In seeds prior to inoculation, either a day/night warm (34/26 °C) or a cool temperature (22/18 °C) relative to normal (26/22 °C) resulted in altered patterns of gene expression including substantially lower expression of PR1, PR3 and PR10. After seed inoculation with <span class="trait">Cercospora</span> <span class="trait">kikuchii,</span> pathogen accumulation was lowest in seeds produced at 22/18 °C in which of all defense genes, <span class="gene">MMP2</span> was uniquely most highly induced. For seeds inoculated with Diaporthe phaseolorum, pathogen accumulation was lowest in seeds produced at 34/26 °C in which of all defense genes, PR10 was uniquely most highly induced. Our detached seed assays clearly demonstrated that the temperature regimens we applied during seed development produced significant changes in seed defense-related gene expression both pre- and post inoculation and our findings support the hypothesis that global climate change may alter plant-pathogen interactions and thereby potentially crop productivity.
