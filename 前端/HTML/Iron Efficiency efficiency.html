				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], <span class="trait">iron</span> deficiency results in interveinal <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and decreased photosynthetic capacity, leading to stunting and <span class="trait">yield</span> loss. In this study, gene expression analyses investigated the role of soybean replication protein A (RPA) subunits during <span class="trait">iron</span> stress. Nine RPA homologs were significantly differentially expressed in response to <span class="trait">iron</span> stress in the near isogenic lines (NILs) Clark <span class="trait">(iron</span> efficient) and Isoclark <span class="trait">(iron</span> inefficient). RPA homologs exhibited opposing expression patterns in the two NILs, with RPA expression significantly repressed during <span class="trait">iron</span> deficiency in Clark but induced in Isoclark. We used virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) to repress <span class="gene">GmRPA3</span> expression in the <span class="trait">iron</span> inefficient line Isoclark and mirror expression in Clark. <span class="gene">GmRPA3-silenced</span> plants had improved IDC symptoms and chlorophyll content under <span class="trait">iron</span> deficient conditions and also displayed stunted growth regardless of <span class="trait">iron</span> availability. RNA-Seq comparing gene expression between <span class="gene">GmRPA3-silenced</span> and empty vector plants revealed massive transcriptional reprogramming with differential expression of genes associated with defense, immunity, aging, death, protein modification, protein synthesis, photosynthesis and <span class="trait">iron</span> uptake and transport genes. Our findings suggest the <span class="trait">iron</span> efficient genotype Clark is able to induce energy controlling pathways, possibly regulated by SnRK1/TOR, to promote nutrient recycling and stress responses in <span class="trait">iron</span> deficient conditions.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="trait">Iron</span> is a necessary but often limiting nutrient for plant growth and development. Soybeans grown on the high-pH calcareous soils are especially prone to developing <span class="trait">iron</span> deficiency <span class="trait">chlorosis</span> and suffering the resultant <span class="trait">yield</span> losses. Once <span class="trait">iron</span> is transported into the root, it must be translocated from the root to the shoot where it is needed for photosynthesis and other processes. Previous work has indicated that <span class="trait">iron</span> is likely to move through the xylem as ferric citrate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, citrate is effluxed into the xylem by the ferric reductase defective3 (FRD3) protein. Here, we present the identification and characterization of two soybean genes, <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> and <span class="gene">GmFRD3b,</span> with similar sequence and function to AtFRD3. The expression of both <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> and <span class="gene">GmFRD3b</span> is induced by <span class="trait">iron</span> deficiency in the iron-efficient reference cultivar Williams 82. <span class="gene">GmFRD3b,</span> but not <span class="gene">GmFRD3a,</span> is expressed at higher levels in the iron-efficient cultivar Clark than in its iron-inefficient near isogenic line iso-Clark (iso), likely accounting for the higher xylem citrate levels in Clark. Increased xylem citrate levels lead to increased solubility of ferric <span class="trait">iron</span> in Clark xylem exudate as compared to iso-Clark exudate. These results support the hypothesis that high xylem citrate levels are needed for efficient root to shoot translocation of <span class="trait">iron.</span> Along with efficient ferric chelate reductase activity and root <span class="trait">iron</span> uptake activity, high expression levels of FRD3 genes are also proposed as a target for future <span class="trait">iron</span> <span class="trait">efficiency</span> breeding projects.

				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including phosphorus (P), <span class="trait">iron</span> (Fe) and water deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2,</span> from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::GmEXPB2-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and P uptake, especially at low P levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and P uptake at both low and high P levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by Fe and mild water deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including P, Fe and water deficiency. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both P <span class="trait">efficiency</span> and P responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop P uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phosphorus (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize P with high <span class="trait">efficiency.</span> To investigate the effects of <span class="trait">iron</span> (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of Fe in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different P <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing Fe concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The Fe reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total Fe uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more <span class="trait">iron</span> was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="trait">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by Fe deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased Fe concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active Fe in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable Fe concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.

						(1) Total and free gossypol contents were 6.2 and 0.8, 5.4 and 0.5, and 6.1 and 0.7 g/kg in meals processed (solvent extracted) from Bollgard (BG) II, non-BG II or commercial cottonseeds, respectively. (2) Broiler chicks were given one of 7 dietary treatments (iso-nitrogenous, 220 and 195 g crude protein/ kg diet at 0 to 21 and 21 to 42 d, respectively, at a metabolisable energy concentration of 12.15 MJ/kg). The treatments were: D1 (control, soybean meal [SBM] based), D2 and D3 (commercial CSM at 100 g/kg of diet with and without additional <span class="trait">iron),</span> D4 and D5 (BG II CSM with and without additional <span class="trait">iron),</span> and D6 and D7 (non-BG II parental CSM with or without additional <span class="trait">iron).</span> (3) Body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion <span class="trait">efficiency,</span> nutrient utilisation, certain blood constituents and carcase traits were not significantly affected by dietary treatments. (4) Weights of bursa and thymus were significantly higher in groups given diets containing <span class="gene">BG</span> II or non-BG diets containing added <span class="trait">iron.</span> (5) The results suggest that low free gossypol content cottonseed meals, for example, <span class="gene">BG</span> II, non-BG II and commercial solvent-extracted CSM could be included at 100 g/kg in broiler diets, safely replacing soybean meal without additional <span class="trait">iron.</span>
