				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nodulation is an essential process for biological nitrogen (N2) fixation in legumes, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, a β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span>, was found to be critical for soybean (Glycine max) nodulation. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was preferentially expressed at the early stage of nodule development. β-Glucuronidase staining further showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was mainly localized to the nodule vascular trace and nodule vascular bundles, as well as nodule cortical and parenchyma cells, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> might be involved in cell wall modification and extension during nodule formation and development. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> dramatically modified soybean root architecture, increasing the size and number of cortical cells in the root meristematic and elongation zones and expanding root hair density and size of the root hair zone. Confocal microscopy with green fluorescent protein-labeled rhizobium USDA110 cells showed that the infection events were significantly enhanced in the <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span>-overexpressing lines. Moreover, nodule primordium development was earlier in overexpressing lines compared with wild-type plants. Thereby, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in either transgenic soybean hairy roots or whole plants resulted in increased nodule number, nodule mass, and nitrogenase activity and thus elevated plant N and phosphorus content as well as biomass. In contrast, suppression of <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in soybean transgenic composite plants led to smaller infected cells and thus reduced number of big nodules, nodule mass, and nitrogenase activity, thereby inhibiting soybean growth. Taken together, we conclude that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> critically affects soybean nodulation through <span class="gene">modifying root architecture and promoting nodule formation and development and subsequently impacts biological N2 fixation and growth of soybean</span>.
