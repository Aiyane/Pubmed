				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The plant tau class glutathione transferases (GSTs) play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in crops and weeds. In this study, we systematically examined the catalytic and structural features of a GST isoenzyme from Glycine max (<span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span>). <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> is a unique isoenzyme in soybean that is specifically expressed in response to <span class="gene">biotic stress caused by soybean mosaic virus (SMV) infections</span>. <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. The results showed that <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> catalyzes several different reactions and exhibits wide substrate specificity. Of particular importance is the finding that the enzyme shows high antioxidant catalytic function and acts as hydroperoxidase. In addition, its Km for GSH is significantly lower, compared to other plant GSTs, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> is able to perform efficient catalysis under conditions where the concentration of reduced glutathione is low (e.g. oxidative stress). The crystal structure of <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> was solved by molecular replacement at 1.6Å resolution in complex with glutathione sulfenic acid (GSOH). Structural analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmGSTU10-10</span> shares the same overall fold and domain organization as other plant cytosolic GSTs; however, major variations were identified in helix H9 and the upper part of helix H4 that affect the size of the active site pockets, substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism. The results of the present study provide new information into GST diversity and give further insights into the complex regulation and enzymatic functions of this plant gene superfamily.
