				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Three DREB homologue genes, <span class="gene">GmDREBa</span>, <span class="gene">GmDREBb</span>, and <span class="gene">GmDREBc</span>, were isolated from soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Each of the deduced proteins contains an AP2 domain of 64 amino acids. Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that all of the three dehydration-responsive, element-binding proteins specifically bound to the dehydration-responsive element. Analysis of transcriptional activation abilities of these proteins in yeast indicated that <span class="gene">GmDREBa</span> and <span class="gene">GmDREBb</span> could activate the expression of a reporter gene, whereas <span class="gene">GmDREBc</span> could not. The transcriptions of <span class="gene">GmDREBa</span> and <span class="gene">GmDREBb</span> were induced by salt, drought, and cold stresses in leaves of soybean seedlings. The expression of <span class="gene">GmDREBc</span> was not significantly affected in leaves but apparently induced in roots by salt, drought, and abscisic acid treatments. These results suggest that these three genes function specifically in response to abiotic stresses in soybean.
