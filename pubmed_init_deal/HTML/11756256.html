				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Seed coats of soybean crack under various stress conditions. Cracking of seed coats degrades the external appearance of soybean seeds and reduces their commercial value. Previous studies revealed that the T gene responsible for pubescence color, and the maturity genes, <span class="gene">E1</span> and <span class="gene">E5</span>, had inhibitory effects on low-temperature induced seed coat cracking. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the T gene and five maturity genes (<span class="gene">E1</span> to <span class="gene">E5</span>) on the intensity of seed coat cracking induced by pod-removal treatments. Soybean cv. Harosoy (te1e2<span class="gene">E3</span><span class="gene">E4</span>e5) and its near-isogenic lines for T and <span class="gene">E1</span> to <span class="gene">E5</span> loci were used in the experiment. Cracking was induced by removing the upper 50% of pods on the plant 40 d after anthesis. Frequency and degree of cracking were not different among the isolines in the control group. In contrast, there were significant differences among isolines subjected to the pod-removal treatment. Frequency and degree of cracking was low in Harosoy, Harosoy-<span class="gene">E1</span>, e3, and e4, and high in Harosoy-T and <span class="gene">E2</span>. The results suggest that genotypes at T and <span class="gene">E2</span> loci were associated with severity of seed coat cracking induced by pod-removal. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.90**) between individual seed weight and frequency of cracking among isolines in the pod-removal treatment. Seed coat cracking was probably exacerbated in part by the genes that allow enlargement of individual seeds in response to pod-removal. The differences among isolines suggest that the mechanism of seed coat cracking induced by pod removal may differ from that induced by low temperature treatment.
