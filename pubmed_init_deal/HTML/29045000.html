				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A potential mechanism to <span class="gene">enhance utilization of sparingly soluble forms of phosphorus (P)</span> is the root secretion of malate, which is mainly mediated by the ALMT gene family in plants. In this study, a total of 34 GmALMT genes were identified in the soybean genome. Expression patterns diverged considerably among GmALMTs in response to phosphate (Pi) starvation in leaves, roots and flowers, with expression altered by P availability in 26 of the 34 GmALMTs. One root-specific GmALMT whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span>, was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean P nutrition. Analysis of <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span>, demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots. Furthermore, both growth and P content of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span> were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external P source. Taken together, these results indicate that members of the soybean GmALMT gene family exhibit diverse responses to Pi starvation. One member of this family, <span class="gene">GmALMT5</span>, might contribute to soybean <span class="gene">P efficiency</span> by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble P sources under P limited conditions.
