				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A Glycine max syntaxin 31 homolog (<span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span>) was identified as being expressed in nematode-induced feeding structures known as syncytia undergoing an incompatible interaction with the plant parasitic nematode Heterodera glycines. The observed <span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span> expression was consistent with prior gene expression analyses that identified the alpha soluble NSF attachment protein (<span class="gene">Gm-α-SNAP</span>) resistance gene because homologs of these genes physically interact and function together in other genetic systems. Syntaxin 31 is a protein that resides on the cis face of the Golgi apparatus and binds α-SNAP-like proteins, but has no known role in resistance. Experiments presented here show <span class="gene">Gm-α-SNAP</span> overexpression induces <span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span> transcription. Overexpression of <span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span> rescues G. max [Williams 82/PI 518671], genetically rhg1 (-/-), by suppressing H. glycines parasitism. In contrast, <span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span> RNAi in the rhg1 (+/+) genotype G. max [Peking/PI 548402] increases susceptibility. <span class="gene">Gm-α-SNAP</span> and <span class="gene">Gm-SYP38</span> overexpression induce the transcriptional activity of the cytoplasmic receptor-like kinase BOTRYTIS INDUCED KINASE 1 (<span class="gene">Gm-BIK1-6</span>) which is a family of defense proteins known to anchor to membranes through a 5' MGXXXS/T(R) N-myristoylation sequence. <span class="gene">Gm-BIK1-6</span> had been identified previously by RNA-seq experiments as expressed in syncytia undergoing an incompatible reaction. <span class="gene">Gm-BIK1-6</span> overexpression rescues the resistant phenotype. In contrast, <span class="gene">Gm-BIK1-6</span> RNAi increases parasitism. The analysis demonstrates a role for syntaxin 31-like genes in resistance that until now was not known.
