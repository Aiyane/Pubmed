				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						NAC transcription factors are known to be involved in regulation of plant responses to drought stress. In this study, the expression of 23 drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was <span class="gene">assessed in the shoot tissues of DT51 and MTD720</span>, the two soybean varieties with contrasting drought-responsive phenotypes, by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) under normal and drought conditions. Results indicated that expression profile of <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes was genotype-dependent, and six <span class="gene">GmNAC</span>s (<span class="gene">GmNAC</span>019, 043, 062, 085, 095 and 101) had higher transcript levels in the shoots of the drought-tolerant DT51 in comparison with the drought-sensitive MTD720 under drought. Our study suggests a positive correlation between the higher drought tolerance degree of DT51 versus MTD720 and the up-regulation of at least these six drought-responsive <span class="gene">GmNAC</span>s in the shoot tissues. Furthermore, on the basis of our analysis, three genes, <span class="gene">GmNAC</span>043, 085 and 101, were identified as promising <span class="gene">candidates for development of drought-tolerant soybean cultivars</span> by genetic engineering.
