				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (<span class="gene">SACPD</span>)-catalyzed synthesis of oleic acid (18:1) is an essential step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Arabidopsis mutants (ssi2) with reduced <span class="gene">SACPD</span> activity accumulate salicylic acid (SA) and exhibit enhanced <span class="gene">resistance to multiple pathogens</span>. We show that reduced levels of 18:1 induce similar defense-related phenotypes in soybean. A Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)-based vector was employed to effectively silence soybean <span class="gene">SACPD</span>s. The silenced plants contained reduced 18:1 and increased stearic acid, developed spontaneous cell death lesions, increased SA accumulation, and constitutively expressed pathogenesis-related genes. These plants also expressed elevated levels of resistance-like genes and showed resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens. Exogenous application of glycerol induced similar phenotypes, mimicking the effect of silencing <span class="gene">SACPD</span>s in healthy soybean plants. Overexpression of a soybean <span class="gene">SACPD</span> increased 18:1 levels in ssi2 but not in wild-type Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that the soybean enzyme was under feedback regulation similar to that of the Arabidopsis isozymes. These results suggest that soybean and Arabidopsis respond similarly to 18:1-derived cues by inducing a novel broad-spectrum resistance-conferring pathway, even though they differ significantly in their lipid biosynthetic pathways. We also demonstrate the efficacy of BPMV-induced gene silencing as a tool for functional studies in soybean.
