				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea bacteria or zoospores of the fungus Phytophthora sojae were used to trigger a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in cell cultures of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr. cv. Williams 82). During a screen for genes that show an altered expression as a response to dying neighbour cells we have identified a gene fragment that is specifically but transiently down-regulated in an HR. The corresponding cDNA codes for the ribosomal protein L2 (<span class="gene">rpL2</span>) of 80S ribosomes, which is essential for the peptidyl-transferase activity. Two gene copies of <span class="gene">rpL2</span> exist in soybean and both genes are transcribed. The temporary down-regulation of the <span class="gene">rpL2</span> genes is followed by a transient block in the synthesis of new proteins as visualised by pulse-labelling experiments using 35S-amino acids. The same basic phenomenon was also found after treatment of soybean cells with other stress-causing compounds such as elicitors or heavy metals. It is suggested that the transient block in protein synthesis allows a more rapid depletion of, for example, signal molecules with a short half-life time and thus leads to a faster adaptation of the cellular protein inventory to the new environmental conditions.
