				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">YABBY family</span> is a plant specific transcription factor family, with the typical N-terminal C2C2 type zinc finger domain and the C-terminal YABBY conservative structure domain, which plays important biological roles in plant growth, development and morphogenesis. In this study, a total of 17 YABBY genes were identified in the soybean genome. The results of this research showed that 17 soybean YABBY genes were located on 11 chromosomes. Analysis of putative cis-acting elements showed that soybean YABBY genes contained lots of MYB and MYC elements. Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expressions of <span class="gene">GmYABBY3</span>, <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> and <span class="gene">GmYABBY16</span> were more <span class="gene">highly sensitive in drought, NaCl and ABA stresses</span>. And the transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that <span class="gene">GmYABBY3</span> protein distributed uniformly the whole cells, while <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> protein was mainly localized in the membranes and cytoplasm and <span class="gene">GmYABBY16</span> protein was localized the nucleus and membranes. To further identify the function of <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span>, we obtained the transgenic Arabidopsis overexpression <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span>. Based on germination and seedling root arrays in transgenic Arabidopsis, we found that the rates of wild type seeds was a litter higher than that of <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> transgenic seeds under both PEG and NaCl treatment. While the root length and root surface of wild type seedlings were bigger than those of <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> transgenic seedlings. When seedlings were grown in soil, the survival rates of wild type were higher than those of transgenic plants under both PEG and NaCl treatment, which indicated that <span class="gene">GmYABBY10</span> <span class="gene">may be a negatively regulator in plant resistances to drought and salt stresses</span>. This study provided valuable information regarding the classification and functions of YABBY genes in soybean.
