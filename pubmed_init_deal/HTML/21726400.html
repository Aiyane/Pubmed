				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The effector gene <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> of Phytophthora sojae <span class="gene">determines the efficacy of the resistance gene <span class="gene">Rps1b</span> in soybean. The sequences of the <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> locus in 34 Chinese isolates of P. sojae were obtained and analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inverse PCR. Four different alleles and a complete deletion mutation of the <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> gene were identified. Molecular analysis of the deletion breakpoints in the <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> locus revealed that an 8-kb DNA sequence containing <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> was deleted and a 12.7-kb DNA sequence was inserted at the same locus. A truncated transposase gene was found and five transposable elements were predicted in the inserted sequence, suggesting that the deletion of <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> might be attributed to transposon movement. The transcription of <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> was analysed in virulent isolates containing four alleles of <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span> by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. In all virulent isolates, only those isolates containing the second allele transcripted <span class="gene">Avr1b-1</span>.
