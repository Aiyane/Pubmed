				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MYB transcription factors play important roles in the regulation of plant growth, developmental metabolism and stress responses. In this study, a new MYB transcription factor gene, <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span>, was isolated from soybean [Glycine max (L.)]. The <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> cDNA is 1296bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 816 bp encoding for 271 amino acids. The amino acid sequence displays similarities to the typical R2R3 MYB proteins reported in other plants. Transient expression analysis using the <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span>-GFP fusion gene in onion epidermal cells revealed that the <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> protein is targeted to the nucleus. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> expression was induced by abiotic stresses, such as drought, cold, salt and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Compared to wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> exhibited an enhanced tolerance to drought and cold stresses. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmMYBJ1</span> has the potential to be utilized in transgenic breeding lines to improve abiotic stress tolerance.
