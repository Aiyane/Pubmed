				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Heat-shock proteins such as <span class="gene">HSP70</span> and <span class="gene">HSP90</span> are important molecular chaperones that play critical roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses; however, the involvement of their co-chaperones in stress biology remains largely uninvestigated. In a screen for candidate genes stimulating cell death in Glycine max (soybean), we transiently overexpressed full-length cDNAs of soybean genes that are highly induced during soybean rust infection in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Overexpression of a type-III DnaJ domain-containing <span class="gene">HSP40</span> (<span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span>), a co-chaperone of <span class="gene">HSP70</span>, caused hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. The HR-like cell death was dependent on MAPKKKα and WIPK, because silencing each of these genes suppressed the HR. Consistent with the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif within the <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> coding sequence, GFP-<span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> was exclusively present in nuclear bodies or speckles. Nuclear localization of <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> was necessary for its function, because deletion of the NLS or addition of a nuclear export signal abolished its HR-inducing ability. <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> co-localized with HcRed-SE, a protein involved in pri-miRNA processing, which has been shown to be co-localized with SR33-YFP, a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting a possible role for <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> in mRNA splicing or miRNA processing, and a link between these processes and cell death. Silencing <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> enhanced the susceptibility of soybean plants to Soybean mosaic virus, confirming its positive role in pathogen defense. Together, the results demonstrate a critical role of a nuclear-localized DnaJ domain-containing <span class="gene">Gm<span class="gene">HSP40</span>.1</span> in <span class="gene">cell death and disease resistance</span> in soybean.
