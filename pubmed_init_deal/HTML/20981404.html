				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a destructive foliar disease in soybean-producing countries worldwide. In this study, F(2), F(2:3), and F(7:11) recombinant inbred lines populations derived from Kefeng No.1 × Nannong 1138-2 were used to study inheritance and linkage mapping of the <span class="gene">SMV strain SC8 resistance</span> gene in Kefeng No.1. Results indicated that a single dominant gene (designated R(SC8)) controls resistance, which is located on chromosome 2 (MLG D1b). A mixed segregating population was developed by selfing two heterozygous plants (RHL153-1 and RHL153-2) at four markers adjacent to the locus and used in fine mapping R(SC8). In addition, two genomic-simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers BARCSOYSSR_02_0610 and BARCSOYSSR_02_0616 were identified that flank the two sides of R(SC8). Sequence analysis of the soybean genome indicated that the interval between the two genomic-SSR markers is 200 kb. QRT-PCR analysis of the candidate genes determined that five genes (<span class="gene">Glyma02g13310</span>, 13320, 13400, 13460, and 13470) are likely involved in soybean SMV resistance. These results will have utility in cloning, transferring, and pyramiding of the R(SC8) through marker-assisted selection in soybean breeding programs.
