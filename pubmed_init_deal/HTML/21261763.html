				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Root system architecture responds plastically to some abiotic stresses, including phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and water deficiency, but its response mechanism is still unclear. We cloned and characterized a vegetative β-expansin gene, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span>, from a Pi starvation-induced soybean cDNA library. Transient expression of 35S::<span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span>-GFP in onion epidermal cells verified that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a secretory protein located on the cell wall. <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was found to be primarily expressed in roots, and was highly induced by Pi starvation, and the induction pattern was confirmed by GUS staining in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Results from intact soybean composite plants either over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> or containing knockdown constructs, showed that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is involved in hairy root elongation, and subsequently affects plant growth and P uptake, especially at low P levels. The results from a heterogeneous transformation system indicated that over-expressing <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> in Arabidopsis increased root cell division and elongation, and enhanced plant growth and P uptake at both low and high P levels. Furthermore, we found that, in addition to Pi starvation, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> was also induced by Fe and mild water deficiencies. Taken together, our results suggest that <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> is a critical root β-expansin gene that is intrinsically involved in root system architecture responses to some abiotic stresses, including <span class="gene">P, Fe and water deficiency</span>. In the case of Pi starvation responses, <span class="gene">GmEXPB2</span> may enhance both P efficiency and P responsiveness by regulating adaptive changes of the root system architecture. This finding has great agricultural potential for improving crop P uptake on both low-P and P-fertilized soils.
