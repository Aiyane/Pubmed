				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Abiotic stresses, including high soil salinity, significantly reduce crop production worldwide. Salt tolerance in plants is a complex trait and is regulated by multiple mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms and dissecting the components on their regulatory pathways will provide new insights, leading to novel strategies for the improvement of salt tolerance in agricultural and economic crops of importance. Here we report that soybean salt tolerance 1, named <span class="gene">GmST1</span>, <span class="gene">exhibited strong tolerance to salt stress in the Arabidopsis transgenic lines</span>. The <span class="gene">GmST1</span>-overexpressed Arabidopsis also increased sensitivity to ABA and decreased production of reactive oxygen species under salt stress. In addition, <span class="gene">GmST1</span> significantly improved drought tolerance in Arabidopsis transgenic lines. <span class="gene">GmST1</span> belongs to a 3-prime part of Glyma.03g171600 gene in the <span class="gene">current version of soybean genome sequence annotation</span>. However, comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis around Glyma.03g171600 genomic region confirmed that <span class="gene">GmST1</span> might serve as an intact gene in soybean leaf tissues. Unlike Glyma.03g171600 which was not expressed in leaves, <span class="gene">GmST1</span> was strongly induced by salt treatment in the leaf tissues. By promoter analysis, a TATA box was detected to be positioned close to <span class="gene">GmST1</span> start codon and a putative ABRE and a DRE cis-acting elements were identified at about 1 kb upstream of <span class="gene">GmST1</span> gene. The data also indicated that <span class="gene">GmST1</span>-transgenic lines survived under drought stress and showed a significantly lower water loss than non-transgenic lines. In summary, our results suggest that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmST1</span> significantly improves Arabidopsis tolerance to both salt and drought stresses and the gene may be a potential candidate for genetic engineering of salt- and drought-tolerant crops.
