				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Glyoxalase pathway consists of two enzymes, glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) which detoxifies a highly cytotoxic metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) to its non-toxic form. MG may form advanced glycation end products with various cellular macro-molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA; that ultimately lead to their inactivation. Role of glyoxalase enzymes has been extensively investigated in various plant species which showed their crucial role in salinity, drought and heavy metal stress tolerance. Previously genome-wide analysis of glyoxalase genes has been conducted in model plants Arabidopsis and rice, but no such study was performed in any legume species. RESULTS: In the present study, a comprehensive genome database analysis of soybean was performed and identified a total of putative 41 GLYI and 23 GLYII proteins encoded by 24 and 12 genes, respectively. Detailed analysis of these identified members was conducted including their nomenclature and classification, chromosomal distribution and duplication, exon-intron organization, and protein domain(s) and motifs identification. Expression profiling of these genes has been performed in different tissues and developmental stages as well as under salinity and drought stresses using publicly available RNAseq and microarray data. The study revealed that <span class="gene">GmGLYI-7</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII-8</span> have been expressed intensively in all the developmental stages and tissues; while <span class="gene">GmGLYI-6</span>, <span class="gene">GmGLYI-9</span>, <span class="gene">GmGLYI-20</span>, <span class="gene">GmGLYII-5</span> and <span class="gene">GmGLYII-10</span> were highly abiotic stress responsive members. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies the largest family of glyoxalase proteins to date with 41 GmGLYI and 23 GmGLYII members in soybean. Detailed analysis of GmGLYI and GmGLYII genes strongly indicates the genome-wide segmental and tandem duplication of the glyoxalase members. Moreover, this study provides a strong basis about the biological role and function of <span class="gene">GmGLYI and GmGLYII members</span> in soybean growth, development and stress physiology.
