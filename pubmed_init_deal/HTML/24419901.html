						KEY MESSAGE: We finely map a novel resistance gene ( RpsJS ) to Phytophthora sojae in soybean. RpsJS was mapped in 138.9 kb region, including three NBS-LRR type predicted genes, on chromosome 18. Phytophthora root rot (PRR) caused by Phytophthora sojae (P. sojae) has been reported in most soybean-growing regions throughout the world. Development of PRR resistance varieties is the most economical and environmentally safe method for controlling this disease. Chinese soybean line Nannong 10-1 is resistant to many P. sojae isolates, and shows different reaction types to P. sojae isolates as compared with those with known Rps (Resistance to P. sojae) genes, which suggests that the line may carry novel Rps genes or alleles. A mapping population of 231 F(2) individuals from the cross of Nannong 10-1 (Resistant, R) and 06-070583 (Susceptible, S) was used to map the Rps gene. The segregation fits a ratio of 3R:1S within F(2) plants, indicating that resistance in Nannong 10-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene (designated as RpsJS). The results showed that RpsJS was mapped on soybean chromosome 18 (molecular linkage group G, MLG G) flanked by SSR (simple repeat sequences) markers BARCSOYSSR_18_1859 and SSRG60752K at a distance of 0.9 and 0.4 cm, respectively. Among the 14 genes annotated in this 138.9 kb region between the two markers, three genes (<span class="gene">Glyma18g51930</span>, <span class="gene">Glyma18g51950</span> and <span class="gene">Glyma18g51960</span>) are the nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type gene, which may be involved in recognizing the presence of pathogens and ultimately conferring resistance. Based on marker-assisted resistance spectrum analyses of RpsJS and the mapping results, we inferred that RpsJS was a novel gene or a new allele at the Rps4, Rps5 or Rps6 loci.
