				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean (Glycine max) is a globally important crop, and its growth and yield are severely reduced by abiotic stresses, such as drought, heat, and cold. The cis-acting element DRE (dehydration-responsive element)/CRT plays an important role in activating gene expression in response to these stresses. The Arabidopsis DREB1/CBF genes that encode DRE-binding proteins function as transcriptional activators in the cold stress responsive gene expression. In this study, we identified 14 <span class="gene">DREB1-type transcription factors</span> (<span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>s) from a soybean genome database. The expression of most <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span> genes in soybean was strongly induced by a variety of abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, high salt, and heat. The <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span> proteins activated transcription via DREs (dehydration-responsive element) in Arabidopsis and soybean protoplasts. Transcriptome analyses using transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>s indicated that many of the downstream genes are cold-inducible and overlap with those of Arabidopsis DREB1A. We then comprehensively analyzed the downstream genes of <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>B;1, which is closely related to DREB1A, using a transient expression system in soybean protoplasts. The expression of numerous genes induced by various abiotic stresses were increased by overexpressing <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>B;1 in soybean, and DREs were the most conserved element in the promoters of these genes. The downstream genes of <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>B;1 included numerous soybean-specific stress-inducible genes that encode an <span class="gene">ABA receptor family protein</span>, <span class="gene">GmPYL21</span>, and translation-related genes, such as ribosomal proteins. We confirmed that <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span>B;1 directly activates <span class="gene">GmPYL21</span> expression and enhances ABRE-mediated gene expression in an ABA-independent manner. These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmDREB1</span> proteins activate the expression of numerous soybean-specific stress-responsive genes under diverse abiotic stress conditions.
