				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The plant membrane-localized NADPH oxidases, also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOHs), play crucial roles in various cellular activities, including plant disease responses, and are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a cosmopolitan fungal pathogen that causes Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in soybean. Via a key virulence factor, oxalic acid, it induces programmed cell death (PCD) in the host plant, a process that is reliant on ROS generation. In this study, using protein sequence similarity searches, we identified <span class="gene">17 soybean RBOHs</span> (<span class="gene">GmRBOHs</span>) and studied their contribution to <span class="gene">SSR disease development, <span class="gene">drought tolerance and nodulation</span>. We clustered the soybean RBOH genes into six groups of orthologues based on phylogenetic analysis with their Arabidopsis counterparts. Transcript analysis of all 17 <span class="gene">GmRBOHs</span> revealed that, of the six identified groups, group VI (<span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI</span>) was specifically and drastically induced following S. sclerotiorum challenge. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI</span> using Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) resulted in enhanced <span class="gene">resistance to S. sclerotiorum</span> and markedly reduced ROS levels during disease development. Coincidently, <span class="gene">GmRBOH-VI</span>-silenced plants were also found to be drought tolerant, but showed a reduced capacity to form nodules. Our results indicate that the pathogenic development of S. sclerotiorum in soybean requires the active participation of specific host RBOHs, to induce ROS and cell death, thus leading to the establishment of disease.
