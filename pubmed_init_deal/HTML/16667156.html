				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybeans (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) respond to pathogens by producing isoflavonoid-derived phytoalexins. Chalcone synthase (<span class="gene">CHS</span>) is the first enzyme of the flavonoid/isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway. We investigated changes in the steady state levels of <span class="gene">CHS</span> mRNA and other specific mRNAs at increasing times after inoculation in two different race-specific interactions, one between leaves and the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea (Psg), and one between roots and the fungus, Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea (Pmg). The amount of <span class="gene">CHS</span> mRNA increases significantly in soybean leaves inoculated with an avirulent race of Psg but not with a virulent race or water. In contrast, the increase in <span class="gene">CHS</span> mRNA is similar in roots inoculated with zoospores of either an avirulent or virulent race of Pmg. <span class="gene">CHS</span> mRNA increases significantly in pathogen inoculated roots but not in uninoculated controls. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) has been observed by others to increase in wounded or pathogen-inoculated plants. We report here that HRGP mRNA levels are greater in roots inoculated with an avirulent Pmg race than with a virulent race, but inoculation with either race causes a significant increase in HRGP mRNA with respect to controls. Calmodulin or ubiquitin mRNA do not increase in either uninoculated or inoculated roots and leaves. The possibility that race-specific resistance in soybeans is expressed differently in different organs of the plant is discussed.
