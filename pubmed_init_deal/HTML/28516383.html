				<h2>摘要</h2>

						KEY MESSAGE: A high-resolution genetic map that was constructed for the <span class="gene">Lf1</span> -residing region will provide valuable information for map-based cloning and genetic improvement efforts in soybean. Changes in leaf architecture as photosynthesis factories remain a major challenge for the improvement of crop productivity. Unlike most soybeans, which have compound leaves comprising three leaflets, the soybean <span class="gene">Lf1</span> mutant has a high frequency of compound leaves with five leaflets in a partially dominant manner. Here, we generated a fine genetic map to determine the genetic basis of this multifoliolate leaf trait. A five-leaflet variant Dusam was found in a recently collected landrace cultivar. Phenotypic data were collected from the F2 population of a cross between the Dusam and three-leaflet cultivar V94-5152. The mapping results generated using public markers indicated that the five-leaflet determining gene in Dusam is an allele of the previously studied <span class="gene">Lf1</span> gene on chromosome 8. A high-resolution map delimited the genomic region controlling the leaflet number trait to a sequence length of 49 kb. AP2 domain-containing Glyma.08g281900 annotated in this 49 kb region appeared to be a strong candidate for the <span class="gene">Lf1</span>-encoding gene, as members of the AP2-type transcription factor family regulate lateral organ development. Dusam additionally exhibits visually distinct phenotypes for shattering and seed-coat cracking traits. However, the two traits were clearly unlinked to the <span class="gene">Lf1</span> gene in our mapping population. Interestingly, the mapping results suggest that the <span class="gene">Lf1</span> gene most likely exerts a pleiotropic effect on the number of seeds per pod. Thus, our results provide a strong foundation towards the cloning of this compound leaf development gene and marker-assisted selection of the seeds per pod trait.
