				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						In previous study, a cDNA library enriched for mRNAs encoding ESTs that increased in abundance during infection with Phytophthora sojae was constructed by suppression subtractive hybridization from leaf tissues of a high resistant soybean, and an EST homologous to the class 10 of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins was identified to be up-regulated by microarray and real-time PCR. Here, the full-length cDNA (termed <span class="gene">GmPR10</span>, GenBank accession number FJ960440; ADC31789.1) of the EST was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and contains an open reading frame of 474 bp. The <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> protein included a "P-loop'' motif. The constitutive transcript abundance of <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> in soybean was the highest in leaves, followed by roots and stems. Further analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> mRNA abundance was increased during infection with P. sojae following leaf treatments with gibberellin (GA3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). The dialytically renatured <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> protein significantly inhibited P. sojae hyphal growth and exhibited RNase activity. Transgenic tobacco and soybean plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> showed increased resistance to P. nicotianae Breda and P. sojae, respectively. These results suggest that the <span class="gene">GmPR10</span> protein plays an important role in <span class="gene">host defense against P. sojae infection</span>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the functional characterization of a PR10 protein from soybean in defense against P. sojae.
