				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The genes coding for PGYRPs (proline-, glycine- and tyrosine-rich proteins) are widely distributed across eukaryotes and have been proposed to have critical role in plant development, especially in response to environmental stresses. In this study, total of 12 soybean PGYRPs (<span class="gene">GmPGYRP1</span>-12) were identified from the soybean genome database for the first time and full-length cDNA and DNA sequences of <span class="gene">GmPGYRP7</span> was cloned. <span class="gene">GmPGYRP1</span>-12 genes encoded a set of small predicted proteins (&lt;120 aa) with molecular mass of 7.20-13.29 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.06-6.57. All GmPGYRPs contained three exons and two introns with fixed occurring sites within genomic DNA sequences. In the putative GmPGYRP sequences, <span class="gene">4 amino acids (proline, glycine, tyrosine, and glutamine)</span> account for more than 39% of the total protein composition. GmPGYRPs had a relatively flexible GYPPX motif followed by a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (GCLAAXCCCCXLXC) and showed high similarity to other known PGYRPs, especially in C-terminal region. Most of PGYRPs can be divided into five subgroups according to phylogenetic analysis. The transcripts of <span class="gene">GmPGYRP1</span>, 3, 5, and 7, representing different PGYRP subgroups, appeared in different organs including seedling leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and developing seeds, but mainly accumulated in seedling roots. Furthermore, the expression of <span class="gene">GmPGYRP1</span>, 3, 5, and 7 was significantly regulated by drought, salt and cold, but obviously repressed by abscisic acid (ABA) at early stage. Our data suggest that GmPGYRP genes encoding a class of conservative XYPPX-repeat proteins probably play an important role in plant development as well as in response to abiotic stresses.
