				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phosphate (Pi) remobilization within a plant is critical for plant survival under Pi-limiting conditions. In this paper, a soybean Pi transporter gene, <span class="gene">GmPT1</span>, was characterized. A marked induction of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> transcript was observed in young leaves, mature leaves and lateral roots during long-term Pi starvation. Transgenic tobacco plants containing the <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> gene were obtained using an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. Compared with wild-type plants, transgenic plants showed significant increases in phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE), photosystem II (PSII) function, total dry weight and seed weight under Pi-deficient conditions. <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels and PUE were determined in a soybean recombinant inbred line population during a pot experiment that was conducted to measure chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthetic rate (PN ) and seed yield. Correlation analysis revealed that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels had significantly positive correlations with seed yield, PUE, PN and the quantum yield of PSII primary photochemistry (ΦPSII ). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping for <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> revealed two eQTLs, one of which coincided with both the physical location of <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> and a QTL associated with seed yield. These results suggest that <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> plays a role in <span class="gene">Pi remobilization</span>, and it may be possible to improve soybean seed yields under Pi-limiting conditions by modulating <span class="gene">GmPT1</span> expression levels.
