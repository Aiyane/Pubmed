				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor composed of NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a gene, <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span>, which encodes the NF-YA subunit of the NF-Y complex in soybeans (Glycine max L.). Real time RT-PCR analysis indicated that <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses, such as polyethylene glycol, NaCl and cold. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> may activate its specific targets in the nucleus. Histochemical β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining revealed that the expression of the GUS gene driven by the <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> promoter occurred in various transgenic Arabidopsis tissues. Coexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana and 5' RACE assays indicated that miR169 directs <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> mRNA cleavage in vivo. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> resulted in Arabidopsis with reduced leaf water loss and enhanced drought tolerance. In addition, the transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited increased sensitivity to high salinity and exogenous ABA. Moreover, the transcript levels of ABA biosynthesis (ABA1, ABA2), ABA signaling (ABI1, ABI2) and stress-responsive genes, including RD29A and CBF3, were generally higher in <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> plants than in wild-type controls under normal conditions. These results suggest that the <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span> gene functions in positive modulation of drought stress tolerance and has potential applications in molecular breeding to enhance drought tolerance in crops.
