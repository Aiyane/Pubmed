				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						BACKGROUND: Soybean is a major source of oil and protein in the human diet and in animal feed. However, as soybean is deficient in sulfur-containing amino acids, its nutritional value is limited. Increasing sulfate assimilation and utilization efficiency is a valuable approach to augment the concentration of sulfur-containing amino acids in soybean seeds, and sulfate transporters play important roles in both sulfate uptake and translocation within plants. RESULTS: In this study, we isolated and characterized a soybean sulfate transporter gene: <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span>. The gene was found to be specifically expressed in root tissues and induced by low-sulfur stress. In addition, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> expression in yeast could complement deficiency in the sulfate transporter genes SUL1 and SUL2. Under +S conditions, <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span>-overexpressing tobacco plants accumulated higher levels of organic matter and exhibited enhanced biomass and seed weight compared to control plants. Under -S conditions, acclimation of <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span>-overexpressing plants was much better than control plants. <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span>-overexpressing tobacco seedlings showed better tolerance to drought stress than the control plants, but no significant difference was observed under salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed 515 genes with at least a 2-fold change in expression in the leaves of tobacco plants overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span>. Of these, 227 gene annotations were classified into 12 functional categories associated with 123 relevant pathways, including biosynthesis and metabolism-related proteins, stress-related proteins, and transporters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported here indicate that the increased biomass and seed yield observed in transgenic tobacco plants could have resulted from greater nutrient uptake and transport capability as well as enhanced development and accumulation of organic matter. Taken together, our results indicate that <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> plays an important role in sulfur uptake and could alter the sulfur status of plants. Our study suggests that overexpressing <span class="gene">GmSULTR1;2b</span> may enhance plant yield under +S conditions, reduce plant production loss under -S conditions, and <span class="gene">improve plant tolerance to sulfur deficiency stress</span>.
