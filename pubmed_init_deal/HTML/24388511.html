				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant LRR-RLKs serve as protein interaction platforms, and as regulatory modules of protein activation. Here, we report the isolation of a novel plant-specific LRR-RLK from Glycine soja (termed <span class="gene">GsLRPK</span>) by differential screening. <span class="gene">GsLRPK</span> expression was cold-inducible and shows Ser/Thr protein kinase activity. Subcellular localization studies using GFP fusion protein indicated that <span class="gene">GsLRPK</span> is localized in the plasma membrane. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that temperature, salt, drought, and ABA treatment can alter <span class="gene">GsLRPK</span> gene transcription in G. soja. However, just protein induced by cold stress not by salinity and ABA treatment in tobacco was found to possess kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of <span class="gene">GsLRPK</span> in yeast and Arabidopsis can <span class="gene">enhance <span class="gene">resistance to cold stress</span> and increase the expression of a number of cold responsive gene markers.
