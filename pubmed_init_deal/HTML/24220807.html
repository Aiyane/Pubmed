				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						To determine the relationship between <span class="gene">nodulation restriction</span> by the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele of soybean, <span class="gene">rhizobitoxine-induced chlorosis</span>, and taxonomic grouping of bradyrhizobia, 119 bradyrhizobial isolates were tested in Leonard jar culture for nodulation response and chlorosis induction. In addition to strain USDA 61, the strain originally reported as defining the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> response, eight other isolates (i.e., USDA 62, 83, 94, 238, 252, 259, 260, and 340) were discovered to elicit the nodulation interdiction of the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele. Only 16% of all the bradyrhizobial strains tested induced chlorosis, but seven of the nine strains (78%) interdicted by the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele were chlorosis-inducing strains. Furthermore, in tests for antibiotic resistance profile, eight of the nine interdicted strains (89%) were classed in DNA homology group II. This evidence suggests that the <span class="gene">Rj4</span> allele has a positive value to the host plant in shielding it from nodulation by certain chlorosis-inducing bradyrhizobia of a DNA homology group with impaired efficiency of nitrogen fixation with soybean.
