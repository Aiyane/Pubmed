				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Narrow leaflet soybean (Glycine max) varieties tend to have more seeds per pod than broad leaflet varieties. Narrow leaflet in soybean is conferred by a single recessive gene, ln. Here, we show that the transition from broad (Ln) to narrow leaflet (ln) is associated with an amino acid substitution in the EAR motif encoded by a gene (designated Gm-JAGGED1) homologous to Arabidopsis JAGGED (JAG) that regulates lateral organ development and the variant exerts a pleiotropic effect on fruit patterning. The genomic region that regulates both the traits was mapped to a 12.6-kb region containing only one gene, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span>. Introducing the <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> allele into a loss-of-function Arabidopsis jagged mutant partially restored the wild-type JAG phenotypes, including leaf shape, flower opening, and fruit shape, but the Gm-jag1 (ln) and EAR-deleted <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> alleles in the jagged mutant did not result in an apparent phenotypic change. These observations indicate that despite some degree of functional change of <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> due to the divergence from Arabidopsis JAG, <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> complemented the functions of JAG in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the <span class="gene">Gm-JAG1</span> homoeolog, Gm-JAG2, appears to be sub- or neofunctionalized, as revealed by the differential expression of the two genes in multiple plant tissues, a complementation test, and an allelic analysis at both loci.
