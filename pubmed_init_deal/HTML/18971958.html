				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						At harvest traits such as seed weight are the sum of development and responses to stresses over the growing season and particularly during the reproductive phase of growth. The aim here was to measure quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the seed weight from early development to drying post harvest. One hundred forty-three F(5) derived recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from the cross of soybean cultivars 'Charleston' and 'Dongnong 594' were used for the analysis of QTL underlying mean 100-seed weight at six different developmental stages. QTL x Environment interactions (QE) were analyzed by a mixed genetic mode based on 3 years' data. At an experiment-wise threshold of a=0.05 and by single-point analysis 94 QTL unaffected by QE underlay the mean seed weight at different developmental stages. Sixty-eight QTL affected by QE that also underlay mean seed weight were identified. From the 162 QTL 42 could be located on 12 linkage groups by composite interval mapping (LOD&gt;2.0). The numbers, locations and types of the QTL and the genetic effects were different at each developmental stage. On linkage group C2 the distantly linked QTL swC2-1, swC2-2 and swC2-3 each affected mean seed weight throughout the different developmental stages. The DNA markers linked to the QTL possessed potential for use in marker-assisted selection for soybean seed size. The identification of QTL with genetic main effects and QE interaction effects suggested that such interactions might significantly alter seed weight during seed development.
