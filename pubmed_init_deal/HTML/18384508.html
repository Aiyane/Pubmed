				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">WRKY-type transcription factor</span>s have multiple roles in the plant defence response and developmental processes. Their roles in the abiotic stress response remain obscure. In this study, 64 GmWRKY genes from soybean were identified, and were found to be differentially expressed under abiotic stresses. Nine GmWRKY proteins were tested for their transcription activation in the yeast assay system, and five showed such ability. In a DNA-binding assay, three proteins (<span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span>, GmWRKY27 and <span class="gene">GmWRKY54</span>) with a conserved WRKYGQK sequence in their DNA-binding domain could bind to the W-box (TTGAC). However, GmWRKY6 and <span class="gene">GmWRKY21</span>, with an altered sequence WRKYGKK, lost the ability to bind to the W-box. The function of three stress-induced genes, <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span>, <span class="gene">GmWRKY21</span> and <span class="gene">GmWRKY54</span>, was further investigated using a transgenic approach. <span class="gene">GmWRKY21</span>-transgenic Arabidopsis plants were <span class="gene">tolerant to cold stress</span>, whereas <span class="gene">GmWRKY54</span> <span class="gene">conferred salt and drought tolerance</span>, possibly through the regulation of DREB2A and STZ/Zat10. Transgenic plants over-expressing <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span> showed increased sensitivity to salt and mannitol stress, but decreased sensitivity to abscisic acid, when compared with wild-type plants. In addition, <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span>-transgenic plants showed an increase in lateral roots. These results indicate that the three GmWRKY genes play differential roles in abiotic stress tolerance, and that <span class="gene">GmWRKY13</span> may function in both lateral root development and the abiotic stress response.
