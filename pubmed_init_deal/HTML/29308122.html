				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						There is an increasing global concern about the availability of water for agricultural use. Drought stress negatively impacts plant physiology and crop productivity. Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the important oilseed crops, and its productivity is often reduced by drought. In this study, a commercial extract of <span class="gene">Ascophyllum nodosum (ANE)</span> was evaluated for its potential to alleviate drought stress in soybean. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ANE on the response of soybean plants to drought stress by monitoring stomatal conductance, relative leaf water content, antioxidant activity and expression of stress-responsive genes. Plants treated with ANE had higher relative water content and higher stomatal conductance under drought stress. During early recovery in the post-drought phase, ANE treated plants had significantly higher stomatal conductance. The antioxidant activity was also found higher in the plants treated with ANE. In addition, ANE-treatment led to changes in the expression of stress-responsive genes: <span class="gene">GmCYP707A1a</span>, <span class="gene">GmCYP707A3b</span>, <span class="gene">GmRD22</span>, <span class="gene">GmRD20</span>, <span class="gene">GmDREB1B</span>, <span class="gene">GmERD1</span>, <span class="gene">GmNFYA3</span>, <span class="gene">FIB1a</span>, <span class="gene">GmPIP1b</span>, <span class="gene">GmGST</span>, <span class="gene">GmBIP</span> and <span class="gene">GmTp55</span>. Taken together, these results suggest that applications of ANE improve the drought tolerance of soybean by changing physiology and gene expression.
