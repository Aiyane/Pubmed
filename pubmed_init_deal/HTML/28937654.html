				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Plant <span class="gene">CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)</span>-like proteins are a class of single-repeat MYELOBLASTOSIS ONCOGENE (MYB) transcription factors generally featured by a highly conserved motif SHAQK(Y/F)F, which play important roles in multiple biological processes. Soybean is an important grain legume for seed protein and edible vegetable oil. However, essential understandings regarding CCA1-like proteins are very limited in soybean. In this study, 54 CCA1-like proteins were identified by data mining of soybean genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that soybean CCA1-like subfamily showed evolutionary conservation and diversification. These CCA1-like genes displayed tissue-specific expression patterns, and analysis of genomic organization and evolution revealed 23 duplicated gene pairs. Among them, <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span> was chosen for further investigation. Our protein-protein interaction studies revealed that <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span>, but not its alternatively spliced isoform, interacts with a 14-3-3 protein (<span class="gene">GmSGF14l</span>). Although <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span> was predominately localized in nucleus, the resulting complex of <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span> and <span class="gene">GmSGF14l</span> was almost evenly distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm, supporting that 14-3-3s interact with their clients to alter their subcellular localization. Additionally, qPCR analysis suggested that <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span> and <span class="gene">GmSGF14l</span> synergistically or antagonistically respond to drought, cold and salt stresses. Our findings will contribute to future research in regard to functions of soybean CCA1-like subfamily, especially regulatory mechanisms of <span class="gene">GmMYB138a</span> in response to abiotic stresses.
