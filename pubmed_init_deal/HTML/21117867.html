				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD3)-catalyzed conversion of linoleic acid to linolenic acid (18:3) is an important step for the biosynthesis of fatty acids as well as the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) in plants. We report that silencing three microsomal isoforms of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> enhanced the accumulation of Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) in soybean. The <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span>-silenced plants also accumulated higher levels of JA, even though they contained slightly reduced levels of 18:3. Consequently, the <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span>-silenced plants expressed <span class="gene">JA-responsive pathogenesis</span>-related genes constitutively and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent Pseudomonas syringae. Increased accumulation of BPMV in <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span>-silenced plants was likely associated with their JA levels, because exogenous JA application also increased BPMV accumulation. The JA-derived increase in BPMV levels was likely not due to repression of salicylic acid (SA)-derived signaling because the <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span>-silenced plants were enhanced in SA-dependent defenses. Furthermore, neither exogenous SA application nor silencing the SA-synthesizing phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene altered BPMV levels in soybean. In addition to the altered defense responses, the <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span>-silenced plants also produced significantly larger and heavier seed. Our results indicate that loss of <span class="gene">GmFAD3</span> enhances JA accumulation and, thereby, susceptibility to BPMV in soybean.
