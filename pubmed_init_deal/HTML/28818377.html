				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane protein channels that are members of Major Intrinsic Proteins (MIP) superfamily. AQPs play important roles in plant reproduction, cell elongation, osmoregulation, influence leaf physiology and are responsive to drought and salt tolerance. Small intrinsic proteins (SIPs)belongs to one of the groups of AQPs, which are mainly localized to endoplasmic reticulum(ER). While this group of aquaporin is being well studied in Arabidopsis, grape and other plant species, not much is known about the molecular regulatory mechanisms driven by ER-type AQPs in Glycine Max. In this study, the function of <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> is studied in detail by using both yeast and plant systems. <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> showed a ubiquitous expression pattern in all different tissues in Glycine Max. Heterologous expression of <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> in Nicotiana tabacum conferred a short root phenotype,growth retardation at seedling stage and significant tolerance to oxidative stress (H2O2) both in yeast and plant systems. Auxin (IAA) content significantly increased in transgenic plants compared with that of wild type, however, the abscisic acid (ABA) content was significantly reduced. Subcellular localization and colocalization analyses showed <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> localized to ER plasma membrane. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that <span class="gene">GmSIP1;3</span> is involved in oxidative stress pathways.
