				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We isolated and characterized a soybean gene (<span class="gene">SGN1</span>) encoding a basic beta-1,3-glucanase that is a plant class III isoform of beta-1,3-glucanase. The deduced amino acid sequence of the <span class="gene">SGN1</span> gene is similar to that of the PR-Q'b gene, the basic class III beta-1,3-glucanase of tomato. Based on RNA blot hybridization, <span class="gene">SGN1</span> gene expression was detected in all tissues of 4-day old seedlings, but it was present only in root tissue of 30-day old plants. GUS expression analysis carried out in transgenic tobacco plants harboring a <span class="gene">SGN1</span>::GUS reporter gene revealed the same expression pattern. Furthermore, the expression of <span class="gene">SGN1</span> was strongly induced by a variety of defense-related signals, such as treatment with H(2)O(2), wounding, or treatment with fungal elicitor prepared from Phytophthora spp as well as inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae. However, the expression level of <span class="gene">SGN1</span> was hardly induced with jasmonate, ethephon and salicylate. Overall the results suggest that the <span class="gene">SGN1</span> may play a role in both plant development and plant defense against pathogen attack.
