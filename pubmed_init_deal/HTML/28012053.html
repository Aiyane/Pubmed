				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean is highly sensitive to flooding stress and exhibits markedly reduced plant growth and grain yield under flooding conditions. To explore the mechanisms underlying initial flooding tolerance in soybean, RNA sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis was performed using a flooding-tolerant line and ABA-treated soybean. A total of 31 genes included 12 genes that exhibited similar temporal patterns were commonly changed in these plant groups in response to flooding and they were mainly involved in RNA regulation and protein metabolism. The mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, <span class="gene">ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 1</span>, and <span class="gene">cytochrome P450 77A1</span> was <span class="gene">up-regulated</span> in wild-type soybean under flooding conditions; however, no changes were detected in the flooding-tolerant line or ABA-treated soybean. The mRNA expression of <span class="gene">cytochrome P450 77A1</span> was specifically <span class="gene">up-regulated</span> in root tips by flooding stress, but returned to the level found in control plants following treatment with the P450 inhibitor uniconazole. The survival ratio and root fresh weight of plants were markedly improved by 3-h uniconazole treatment under flooding stress. Taken together, these results suggest that <span class="gene">cytochrome P450 77A1</span> is <span class="gene">suppressed by uniconazole treatment and that this inhibition may enhance soybean tolerance to flooding stress</span>.
