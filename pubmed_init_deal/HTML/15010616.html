				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						We previously isolated a partial soybean cDNA clone whose transcript abundance is increased upon infection by the sedentary, endoparasitic soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines. We now isolated the corresponding full-length cDNA and determined that the predicted gene product was similar to the group of cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase enzymes (PGM/bPGM; EC 5.4.2.1/5.4.2.4). We designated the corresponding soybean gene <span class="gene">GmPGM</span>. PGM and bPGM are key catalysts of glycolysis that have been well characterized in animals but not plants. Using the <span class="gene">GmPGM</span> cDNA sequence, we identified a homologous Arabidopsis thaliana gene, which we designated AtPGM. Histochemical GUS analyses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the AtPGM promoter ::GUS construct revealed that the AtPGM promoter directs GUS expression in uninfected plants only to the shoot and root apical meristems. In infected plants, GUS staining also is evident in the nematode feeding structures induced by the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii and by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Furthermore, we discovered that the AtPGM promoter was down-regulated by abscisic acid and hydroxyurea, whereas it was induced by sucrose, oryzalin, and auxin, thereby revealing expression characteristics typical of genes with roles in meristematic cells. Assessment of the auxin-inducible AUX1 gene promoter (a gene coding for a polar auxin transport protein) similarly revealed feeding cell and meristem expression, suggesting that auxin may be responsible for the observed tissue specificity of the AtPGM promoter. These results provide first insight into the possible roles of PGM/bPGM in plant physiology and in <span class="gene">plant-pathogen interactions</span>.
