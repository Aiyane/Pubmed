				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] plants were exposed to three temperature regimens during seed development to investigate the effect of temperature on the expression of eight defense-related genes and the accumulation of two fungal pathogens in inoculated seeds. In seeds prior to inoculation, either a day/night warm (34/26 °C) or a cool temperature (22/18 °C) relative to normal (26/22 °C) resulted in altered patterns of gene expression including substantially lower expression of PR1, PR3 and <span class="gene">PR10</span>. After seed inoculation with Cercospora kikuchii, pathogen accumulation was lowest in seeds produced at 22/18 °C in which of all defense genes, <span class="gene">MMP2</span> was uniquely most highly induced. For seeds inoculated with Diaporthe phaseolorum, pathogen accumulation was lowest in seeds produced at 34/26 °C in which of all defense genes, <span class="gene">PR10</span> was uniquely most highly induced. Our detached seed assays clearly demonstrated that the temperature regimens we applied during seed development produced significant changes in <span class="gene">seed defense-related gene</span> expression both pre- and post inoculation and our findings support the hypothesis that global climate change may alter plant-pathogen interactions and thereby potentially crop productivity.
