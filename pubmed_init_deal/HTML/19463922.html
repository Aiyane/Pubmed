				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A novel gene encoding a DEAD-box RNA helicase designated as <span class="gene">GmRH</span> was isolated from soybean. Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a close relationship between <span class="gene">GmRH</span> and other orthologous DEAD-box RNA helicases from other plant species. Structural motif analysis revealed that the bipartite lysine rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) is present in the N-terminal variable region of <span class="gene">GmRH</span> and that there are ten conserved motifs found in DEAD-box RNA helicase proteins. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of 2 copies of <span class="gene">GmRH</span> in the soybean genome. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the RNA expression of the <span class="gene">GmRH</span> was induced during low temperature or high salinity stress, but not by the exogenous application of abscisic acid or drought stress. Subcellular localization studies showed that <span class="gene">GmRH</span>((1-355))-GFP is localized in the nucleus, whereas <span class="gene">GmRH</span>((130-355))-GFP is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. This provides the evidence that the N-terminal region predicted as NLS is essential for nuclear targeting of the <span class="gene">GmRH</span> protein in the plant cell. Purified GST-<span class="gene">GmRH</span> recombinant protein was shown to unwind dsRNA independent of ATP in vitro. Here, we propose that <span class="gene">GmRH</span> plays an important role in RNA processing during <span class="gene">low temperature and high salinity stress</span>es in plants.
