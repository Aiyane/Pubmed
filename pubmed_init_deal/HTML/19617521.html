				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is self-pollinated. To produce large quantities of hybrid seed, insect-mediated cross-pollination is necessary. An efficient nuclear male-sterile system for hybrid seed production would benefit from molecular and/or phenotypic markers linked to male fertility/sterility loci to facilitate early identification of phenotypes. Nuclear male-sterile, female-fertile <span class="gene">ms3</span> mutant is a single recessive gene and displays high outcrossed seed set with pollinators. Our objective was to map the <span class="gene">ms3</span> locus. A segregating population of 150 F(2) plants from Minsoy (PI 27890) x T284H, Ms3<span class="gene">ms3</span> (A00-68), was screened with 231 simple sequence repeat markers. The <span class="gene">ms3</span> locus mapped to molecular linkage group (MLG) D1b (Gm02) and is flanked by markers <span class="gene">Satt157</span> and <span class="gene">Satt542,</span> with a distance of 3.7 and 12.3 cM, respectively. Female-partial sterile-1 (<span class="gene">Fsp1</span>) and the Midwest Oilseed male-sterile (<span class="gene">msMOS</span>) mutants previously were located on <span class="gene">MLG D1b</span>. <span class="gene">msMOS</span> and <span class="gene">Fsp1</span> are independent genes located very close to each other. All 3 genes are located in close proximity of <span class="gene">Satt157</span>. We believe that this is the first report of <span class="gene">clustering of fertility-related genes</span> in plants. Characterization of these closely linked genes may help in understanding the evolutionary relationship among them.
