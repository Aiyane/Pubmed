				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Drought is detrimental to plant growth and development, and often results in significant losses to the yields of economically important crops such as soybeans (Glycine max L.). NAC <span class="gene">transcription factors (TFs)</span>, which consist of a large family of plant-specific TFs, have been reported to enhance drought tolerance in a number of plants. In this study, 31 unigenes that contain the complete open reading frames encoding <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins were identified and cloned from soybean. Analysis of C-terminal regulatory domain using yeast one-hybrid system indicated that among 31 <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins, 28 have transcriptional activation activity. Expression analysis of these <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes showed that they are differentially expressed in different organs, suggesting that they have diverse functions during plant growth and development. To search for the drought-inducible <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes, we prescreened and re-confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis that nine <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes are induced by dehydration stress with differential induction levels in both shoot and root. The expression profiles of these nine <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> genes were also examined under other stresses such as high salinity, cold and with abscisic acid hormone treatments. Phylogenetic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins with previously reported drought-inducible NAC proteins of Arabidopsis and rice revealed that the nine drought-inducible <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> proteins belong to the "stress-inducible" NAC group. The results of this systematic analysis of the <span class="gene">GmNAC</span> family will provide novel tools and resources for the development of <span class="gene">improved drought tolerant</span> transgenic soybean cultivars.
