				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), a member of the Potyvirus genus, is a prevalent and devastating viral pathogen in soybean-growing regions worldwide. Potyvirus replication occurs in the 6K2-induced viral replication complex at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites. Potyvirus-encoded P3 is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and is as an essential component of the viral replication complex, playing a key role in viral replication. This study provides evidence that the soybean (Glycine max) reticulon homology domain protein (designated as <span class="gene">GmRHP</span>) interacts with SMV-P3 by using a two-hybrid yeast system to screen a soybean cDNA library. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay further confirmed the interaction, which occurred on the cytomembrane, endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeleton in Nicotiana benthamiana cells. The transient expression of <span class="gene">GmRHP</span> can promote the coupling of Turnip mosaic virus replication and cell-to-cell movement in N. benthamiana. The interaction between the membrane protein SMV-P3 and <span class="gene">GmRHP</span> may contribute to the potyvirus infection, and <span class="gene">GmRHP</span> may be an essential host factor for P3's involvement in potyvirus replication.
