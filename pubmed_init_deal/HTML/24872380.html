				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Enhanced disease susceptibility1 (EDS1) and phytoalexin deficient4 (PAD4) are well-known regulators of both basal and resistance (R) protein-mediated plant defense. We identified two EDS1-like (<span class="gene">GmEDS1a</span>/<span class="gene">GmEDS1b</span>) proteins and one PAD4-like (<span class="gene">GmPAD4</span>) protein that are required for <span class="gene">resistance signaling</span> in soybean (Glycine max). Consistent with their significant structural conservation to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) counterparts, constitutive expression of GmEDS1 or <span class="gene">GmPAD4</span> complemented the pathogen resistance defects of Arabidopsis eds1 and pad4 mutants, respectively. Interestingly, however, the GmEDS1 and <span class="gene">GmPAD4</span> did not complement pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation in the eds1/pad4 mutants. Furthermore, the <span class="gene">GmEDS1a</span>/<span class="gene">GmEDS1b</span> proteins were unable to complement the turnip crinkle virus coat protein-mediated activation of the Arabidopsis R protein Hypersensitive reaction to Turnip crinkle virus (HRT), even though both interacted with HRT. Silencing <span class="gene">GmEDS1a</span>/<span class="gene">GmEDS1b</span> or <span class="gene">GmPAD4</span> reduced basal and pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation and enhanced soybean susceptibility to virulent pathogens. The <span class="gene">GmEDS1a</span>/<span class="gene">GmEDS1b</span> and <span class="gene">GmPAD4</span> genes were also required for Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea2 (Rpg2)-mediated resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Notably, the <span class="gene">GmEDS1a</span>/<span class="gene">GmEDS1b</span> proteins interacted with the cognate bacterial effector AvrA1 and were required for its virulence function in rpg2 plants. Together, these results show that despite significant structural similarities, conserved defense signaling components from diverse plants can differ in their functionalities. In addition, we demonstrate a role for GmEDS1 in regulating the virulence function of a bacterial effector.
