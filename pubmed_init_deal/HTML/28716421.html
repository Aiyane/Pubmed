				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Two biosynthetic routes are known for putrescine, an essential plant metabolite. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) converts ornithine directly to putrescine, while a second route for putrescine biosynthesis utilizes arginine decarboxylase (ADC) to convert arginine to agmatine, and two additional enzymes, agmatine iminohydrolase (AIH) and N-carbamoyl putrescine aminohydrolase (NLP1) to complete this pathway. Here we show that plants can use ADC and <span class="gene">arginase/agmatinase (ARGAH)</span> as a third route for putrescine synthesis. Transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana ADC2, and any of the arginases from A. thaliana (ARGAH1, or ARGHA2) or the soybean gene Glyma.03g028000 (<span class="gene">GmARGAH</span>) into a yeast strain deficient in ODC, fully complemented the mutant phenotype. In vitro assays using purified recombinant enzymes of AtADC1 and AtARGAH2 were used to show that these enzymes can function in concert to convert arginine to agmatine and putrescine. Transient expression analysis of the soybean genes (Glyma.06g007500, ADC; Glyma.03g028000 <span class="gene">GmARGAH</span>) and the A. thaliana ADC2 and ARGAH genes in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, showed that these proteins are localized to the chloroplast. Experimental support for this pathway also comes from the fact that expression of AtARGAH, but not AtAIH or AtNLP1, is co-regulated with AtADC2 in response to drought, oxidative stress, wounding, and methyl jasmonate treatments. Based on the high affinity of ARGAH2 for agmatine, its co-localization with ADC2, and typically low arginine levels in many plant tissues, we propose that these two enzymes can be major contributors to putrescine synthesis in many A. thaliana stress responses.Published by Elsevier B.V.
