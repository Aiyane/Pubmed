				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						A new member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, <span class="gene">GmERF3</span>, was isolated from soybean. Sequence analysis showed that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> contained an AP2/ERF domain of 58 amino acids and two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains. It belonged to a group IV protein in the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily as typified by a conserved N-terminal motif [MCGGAI(I/L)]. Expression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> was induced by treatments with high salinity, drought, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV), whereas there was no significant <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> mRNA accumulation under cold stress treatment. <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> could bind to the GCC box and DRE/CRT element, and was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. The <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> protein fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast. Ectopic expression of the <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> gene in transgenic tobacco plants induced the expression of some PR genes and enhanced resistance against infection by Ralstonia solanacearum, Alternaria alternata, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and gave tolerance to high salinity and dehydration stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> in transgenic tobacco led to higher levels of free proline and soluble carbohydrates compared to wild-type plants under drought conditions. The overall results suggested that <span class="gene">GmERF3</span> as an AP2/ERF transcription factor may play dual roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.
