				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Color is one of the phenotypic markers mostly used to study soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) genetic, molecular and biochemical processes. <span class="gene">T</span>wo P450-dependent mono-oxygenases, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H; EC1.14.3.21) and flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H, EC1.14.13.88), both catalyzing the hydroxylation of the B-ring in flavonoids, play an important role in coloration. Previous studies showed that the <span class="gene">T</span> locus was a gene encoding F3'H and the <span class="gene">W1</span> locus co-segregated with a gene encoding F3'5'H in soybean. <span class="gene">T</span>hese two genetic loci have identified to control seed coat, flower and pubescence colors. However, the allelic distributions of both F3'H and F3'5'H genes in soybean were unknown. <span class="gene">I</span>n this study, three novel alleles were identified (two of four alleles for <span class="gene">GmF3'H</span> and one of three alleles for GmF3'5'H). A set of gene-tagged markers was developed and verified based on the sequence diversity of all seven alleles. Furthermore, the markers were used to analyze soybean accessions including 170 cultivated soybeans (G. max) from a mini core collection and 102 wild soybeans (G. soja). For both F3'H and F3'5'H, <span class="gene">the marker selection efficiencies for pubescence color and flower color</span> were determined. <span class="gene">T</span>he results showed that one <span class="gene">GmF3'H</span> allele explained 92.2 % of the variation in tawny and two gmf3'h alleles explained 63.8 % of the variation in gray pubescence colors. <span class="gene">I</span>n addition, two GmF3'5'H alleles and one gmF3'5'h allele explained 94.0 % of the variation in purple and 75.3 % in white flowers, respectively. By the combination of the two loci, seed coat color was determined. <span class="gene">I</span>n total, 90.9 % of accessions possessing both the gmf3'h-b and gmf3'5'h alleles had yellow seed coats. <span class="gene">T</span>herefore, seed coat colors are controlled by more than two loci.
