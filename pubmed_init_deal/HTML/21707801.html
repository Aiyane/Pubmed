				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						NAC transcription factors play important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. Previously, we identified multiple NAC genes in soybean (Glycine max). Here, we identify the roles of two genes, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> and <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span>, in stress responses and other processes. The two genes were differentially induced by multiple abiotic stresses and plant hormones, and their transcripts were abundant in roots and cotyledons. Both genes encoded proteins that localized to the nucleus and bound to the core DNA sequence CGT[G/A]. In the protoplast assay system, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> functions as a mild repressor; however, the C-terminal end of GmANC20 has transcriptional activation activity. Over-expression of <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> enhances salt and freezing tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants; however, <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> over-expression only <span class="gene">improves salt tolerance</span>. Over-expression of <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> also promotes lateral root formation. <span class="gene">GmNAC20</span> may regulate stress tolerance through activation of the DREB/CBF-COR pathway, and may control lateral root development by altering auxin signaling-related genes. <span class="gene">GmNAC11</span> probably regulates DREB1A and other stress-related genes. The roles of the two GmNAC genes in stress tolerance were further analyzed in soybean transgenic hairy roots. These results provide a basis for genetic manipulation to improve the agronomic traits of important crops.
