				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is a major viral pathogen of soybean. Among the three SMV resistance genes, Rsv1 mediates extreme resistance (ER) against most SMV strains, including the β-glucuronidase-tagged G2 isolate that was previously used in studies of Rsv1. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), we screened 82 VIGS constructs to identify genes that play a role in Rsv1-mediated ER to SMV infection. The target genes included putative Rsv1 candidate genes, soybean orthologs to known defense-signaling genes, and 62 <span class="gene">WRKY</span> transcription factors. We identified eight VIGS constructs that compromised Rsv1-mediated resistance when the target genes were silenced, including <span class="gene">GmEDR1</span>, <span class="gene">GmEDS1</span>, <span class="gene">GmHSP90</span>, <span class="gene">GmJAR1</span>, <span class="gene">GmPAD4</span>, and two <span class="gene">WRKY</span> transcription factors. Together, our results provide new insight into the soybean signaling network required for ER against SMV.
