				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						MYB, v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog, proteins play central roles in plant stress response. Previously, we identified a novel R2R3-MYB transcription factor, <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span>, which affected the expression levels of some key enzyme genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in transgenic Arabidopsis. In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> under salt, low temperature, drought, abscisic acid (ABA), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation treatments in soybean using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression of <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> was drastically induced by UV irradiation and salt treatment, but no response was detected under low temperature, drought, and ABA stresses. A detailed characterization of the <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> overexpression lines revealed that <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> might be involved in response of <span class="gene">plants to UV radiation and salt stresses</span>. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> showed an increased tolerance to salt and UV radiation treatment compared with wild-type plants. The expression levels of certain salt stress-responsive genes, such as DREB2A and RD17, were found to be elevated in the transgenic plants. These results indicate that <span class="gene">GmMYB12B2</span> acts as a regulator in the plant stress response.
