				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Drought is a limiting factor for N(2) fixation in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] thereby resulting in reduced biomass accumulation and yield. Drought-sensitive genotypes accumulate ureides, a product of N(2) fixation, during drought stress; however, drought-tolerant genotypes have lower shoot ureide concentrations, which appear to alleviate drought stress on N(2) fixation. A key enzyme involved in ureide breakdown in shoots is <span class="gene">allantoate amidohydrolase</span> (<span class="gene">AAH</span>). It is hypothesized that <span class="gene">AAH</span> gene expression in soybean determines shoot ureide concentrations during water-deficit stress and is responsible for the differential sensitivities of the N(2)-fixation response to drought among soybean genotypes. The objectives were to examine the relationship between <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcript levels and shoot ureide concentration and drought tolerance. Drought-tolerant (Jackson) and drought-sensitive (Williams) genotypes were subjected to three water-availability treatments: well-watered control, moderate water-deficit stress, and severe water-deficit stress. Shoot ureide concentrations were examined, in addition to gene expression of <span class="gene">AAH</span> and DREB2, a gene expressed during water-deficit stress. As expected, DREB2 expression was detected only during severe water-deficit stress, and shoot ureide concentrations were greatest in the drought-sensitive genotype relative to the drought-tolerant genotype during water-deficit stress. However, expression of <span class="gene">AAH</span> transcripts was similar among water treatments and genotypes, indicating that <span class="gene">AAH</span> mRNA was not closely associated with drought tolerance. Ureide concentrations in shoots were weakly associated with <span class="gene">AAH</span> mRNA levels. These results indicate that <span class="gene">AAH</span> expression is probably not associated with the increased ureide catabolism observed in drought-tolerant genotypes, such as Jackson. Further study of <span class="gene">AAH</span> at the post-translational and enzymatic levels is warranted in order to dissect the potential role of this gene in drought tolerance.
