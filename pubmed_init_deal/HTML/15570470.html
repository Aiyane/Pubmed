				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) content is decreased in soybean cells following infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (Psg). In this investigation, a differential display approach was applied to isolate soybean genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated by the inhibition of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity and to study if the transcription of those genes is altered following Psg infection. Four genes, transcriptionally activated following treatment with the PI-PLC-specific inhibitor U-73122, were cloned. Three of the four genes were induced following infection with Psg. The transcripts of a hydrolase homologue (<span class="gene">GmHy</span>) were induced in the incompatible but not compatible soybean-Psg interaction. The transcripts of a putative ascorbate oxidase gene (<span class="gene">GmAO</span>) were induced in both compatible and incompatible interactions. <span class="gene">GmHy</span> and <span class="gene">GmAO</span> may represent new classes of <span class="gene">pathogenesis-related</span> genes. In addition to these two novel genes, homologues of PR-10 and polygalacturonase inhibitor protein (<span class="gene">GmPR10</span> and <span class="gene">GmPGIP</span>, respectively) were identified. These two genes have previously been reported as <span class="gene">pathogenesis-related</span>. Transcripts of GmPR-10, but not <span class="gene">GmPGIP</span>, were induced in both compatible and incompatible soybean-Psg interactions. Induction of these genes, except for <span class="gene">GmPGIP</span>, following inhibition of PI-PLC by either the U-73122 treatment or bacterial infection suggests that PI-PLC may negatively regulate the expression of defence genes.
