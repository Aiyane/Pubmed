				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein) transcription factors have important roles in the stress-related regulation network in plants. A DREB orthologue, <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span>, belonging to the A-5 subgroup of the DREB subfamily, was isolated from soybean using the RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) method. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> in soybean seedlings was induced following cold stress treatment for 0.5 h and was not detected after 3 h. However, it was not induced by drought and high salt stresses or by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. This response was similar to those of members in the A-1 subgroup and different from those of other members in the A-5 subgroup, suggesting that the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> gene was involved in an ABA-independent cold stress-responsive signal pathway. Furthermore, analysis of the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> promoter elucidated its cold-induced modulation. A promoter fragment containing bases -1058 to -664 was involved in response to cold stress, and its effect was detected for 1 h after treatment, but a transcriptional repressor appeared to impair this response by binding to a cis-element in the region -1403 to -1058 at 24 h after the beginning of cold stress. Moreover, the <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> protein could specifically bind to the DRE element in vitro, and activated expression of downstream reporter genes in yeast cells. In addition, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> <span class="gene">enhanced tolerance to cold, drought, and high salt stresses</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis. Physiological analyses indicated that the fresh weight and osmolality of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> transgenic Arabidopsis under cold stress were higher than those of wild-type controls. <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> transgenic tobacco accumulated higher levels of free proline under drought stress and retained higher leaf chlorophyll levels under high salt stress than wild-type tobacco. In addition, constitutive expression of <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> in transgenic Arabidopsis caused growth retardation, whereas its expression under control of the stress-inducible Rd29A promoter minimized negative effects on plant growth under normal growth conditions, indicating that a combination of the Rd29A promoter and <span class="gene">GmDREB3</span> might be useful for improving tolerance to environmental stresses in crop plants.
