				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Phosphorus (P)-efficient soybean (Glycine max) plants absorb and utilize P with high efficiency. To investigate the effects of iron (Fe)-deficient conditions on the absorption and utilization of Fe in P-efficient soybean plants, two soybean cultivars with different P efficiency, the 03-3 (P-efficient variety) and Bd-2 (P-inefficient variety), were used in this study. The two soybean cultivars were grown in nutrient solution containing Fe concentrations of 0 (Fe0), 20 (Fe20), 40 (Fe40), or 80 (Fe80) μM for 7 days. The Fe reductase activity of roots was higher in 03-3 plants grown under the Fe0, Fe20, and Fe40 treatments than in Bd-2 plants and the total Fe uptake was greater in 03-3 plants under the Fe40 treatment. <span class="gene">GmFRD3a</span> was much more highly expressed in the stem of 03-3 than in that of Bd-2, and significantly more iron was transported to 03-3 plant shoots during Fe0 treatment. <span class="gene">Chlorosis</span> in young leaves caused by Fe deficiency under the Fe0 and Fe20 treatments was alleviated by increased Fe concentration in shoots. Increased levels of active Fe in young 03-3 leaves under Fe-deprivation conditions (Fe0) and maintenance of stable Fe concentrations in 03-3 shoots subjected to Fe20, Fe40, and Fe80 treatments suggested that the P-efficient 03-3 cultivar is also Fe-efficient. It is suggested that 03-3 soybean cultivar should be a good resource for application to farm field.
