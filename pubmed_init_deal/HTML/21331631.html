				<h2>摘要</h2>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						<span class="gene">Abscisic acid</span> (ABA)-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) are basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factors that bind to the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) in the promoter regions of ABA-inducible genes in plants. A novel bZIP transcription factor gene, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span>, encoding 438 amino acids with a conserved bZIP domain composed of 60 amino acids was isolated from salt-tolerant soybean cv. Tiefeng 8. Southern blotting showed that only one copy was present in the soybean genome. Phylogenetic analyses showed that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> belonged to the AREB subfamily of the bZIP family and was most closely related to AtABF2 and OsTRAB1. The expression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was highly induced by ABA, drought, high salt and low temperature; and <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was expressed in soybean roots, stems and leaves under different stress conditions. <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was localized inside the nuclei of transformed onion epidermal cells. Overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> enhanced the responses of transgenic plants to ABA and triggered stomatal closure under stresses, potentially leading to improved tolerances to several abiotic stresses such as high salt, low temperature and drought in transgenic plants. Furthermore, overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> affected the expression of some ABA or stress-related genes involved in regulating stomatal closure in Arabidopsis under ABA, drought and high salt stress conditions. A few AREB elements were detected in the promoter region of those ABA or stress-related genes, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> regulates the ABA response or stomatal closure mediated by those downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis. Moreover, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> was used to improve the drought tolerance trait of Chinese wheat varieties BS93. Functional analysis showed that overexpression of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> <span class="gene">enhanced the drought tolerance</span> of transgenic wheat, and transcripts of <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> were detected in transgenic wheat using RT-PCR. In addition, <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> overexpression did not result in growth retardation in all transgenic plants, suggesting that <span class="gene">GmbZIP1</span> may be a valuable genetic resource for engineering stress tolerance of crops.
