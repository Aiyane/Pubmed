BOARD INVITED REVIEW: Immunomodulatory potential of dietary soybean-derived
isoflavones and saponins in pigs.

In this review, the potential for use of soy-derived bioactive compounds as
immunomodulatory feed additives in pigs is discussed. Soy is a major component of
the modern U.S. swine diet in today's commercial industry, providing the bulk of 
dietary AA necessary for growth and production. However, soy use has generally
been limited in early growth phases, during which the risks of immunological
insult and disease are among the highest. Improvements of soybean processing and 
development of soy protein products with little to no antinutritional factors
have made soy more appropriate for use in young pigs but additional processing
may impact bioactive compound levels in the feed. The bioactive compounds of
interest for this review are soy isoflavones and soy saponins. Soy isoflavones
are flavonoid compounds with a range of biological activity including moderate
estrogenic effects at low biological concentrations. While estrogenic effects are
of more interest in human medical research, isoflavones are also known for their 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidative properties at cellular levels, engaging several 
receptors and pathways including inhibition of NF-κB activation and
inducible-nitric oxide synthase enzymes; thereby, ascribing anti-viral
properties. Saponins, amphipathic glycoside compounds, also engage
anti-inflammatory pathways, though their biological activity in pigs has not been
well investigated and seem to mainly be observed on the mucous membrane in the
gastrointestinal tract. Regarding use as an immunomodulatory feed additive,
supplemental soy isoflavones have been shown to improve immunological status of
pigs and produce mild improvements of growth performance under certain disease
challenges including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).
While more in vivo research in pigs is needed to fully understand biological
activity of these compounds in the live animal, soy-derived bioactive compounds
show great potential as a health promoting feed additive for the modern swine
industry.

Phytohormones are central to the plant growth and development. Despite the
advancement in our knowledge of hormone signaling, downstream targets and their
interactions upon hormones action remain largely fragmented, especially at the
protein and metabolite levels. With an aim to get new insight into the effects of
two hormones, ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA), this study utilizes an
integrated proteomics and metabolomics approach to investigate their individual
and combined (ABA+ET) signaling in soybean leaves. Targeting low-abundance
proteins, our previously established protamine sulfate precipitation method was
applied, followed by label-free quantification of identified proteins. A total of
4129 unique protein groups including 1083 differentially modulated in one
(individual) or other (combined) treatments were discerned. Functional annotation
of the identified proteins showed an increased abundance of proteins related to
the flavonoid and isoflavonoids biosynthesis and MAPK-signaling pathway in
response to ET treatment. HPLC analysis showed an accumulation of isoflavones
(genistin, daidzein, and genistein) upon ET treatment, in agreement with the
proteomics results. A metabolome analysis assigned 79 metabolites and further
confirmed the accumulation of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in response to ET. A
potential cross-talk between ET and MAPK-signaling, leading to the accumulation
of flavonoids and isoflavonoids in soybean leaves is suggested. This article is

In this study, the effects of UV-B radiation on the isoflavones accumulation,
physiological and nutritional quality, water status, and characteristics of
proteins in germinated soybeans were investigated. The results showed that
isoflavones content in soybeans increased with appropriate intensity and time of 
UV-B radiation and decreased with excessive treatment. Fresh weight, length, free
amino acids, reducing sugar contents and bulk water (T23) in germinated soybeans 
decreased with increasing radiation time, indicating that UV-B inhibited the
growth and nutrients metabolism of soybean during germination. Cell damage was
detected in germinated soybeans with excessive UV-B radiation, as shown by the
black spots in cotyledons and the increased intercellular water determined by
LF-NMR. Germination resulted in an increase in random coil structures, while UV-B
radiation induced no obvious changes in FT-IR spectrum and protein conformation
of soybeans. Both UV-B radiation and germination caused the increase in soluble
proteins, especially in 1.0-75.0 kDa fraction.

This work was the first to investigate on the simultaneous characterization of
metabolite profiles in soybean using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Twenty two
compositions were observed within 14&nbsp;min from the methanol extract and confirmed 
as twelve isoflavones of three types and ten soyasaponins (Ab, Af, I-III, αg, βg,
βa, γg, and γa). Moreover, the patterns of two chemicals showed considerable
differences in seven solvent systems by HPLC analysis and their optimal
extraction was achieved by 70% methanol (isoflavone: 4102.69&nbsp;μg/g; soyasaponin:
ten peaks). The second abundant isoflavones were detected in 50% methanol
(4054.39&nbsp;μg/g), followed by 30% methanol, 100% methanol, 10% methanol, CH2Cl2,
and acetone extracts with 3134.03, 2979.49, 1681.33, 366.19, and 119.00&nbsp;μg/g,
respectively. Soyasaponins exhibited similar tendencies as those of isoflavones. 
The highest total phenolic was found as 2.10&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;mg GAE/g in 70% methanol with
remarkable differences by comparing other extracts. Specifically, this extract
showed potent α-glucosidase inhibitory (81%) and antioxidant capacities (DPPH:
93% and ABTS: 95%) at a concentration of 1.0&nbsp;mg/mL. Our results may be
contributed to enhancing the value to functional foods and evaluating the
secondary metabolites concern to antioxidant properties using solvent system in
soybean.

Adulteration of edible oils has attracted attention from more researchers and
consumers in recent years. Complex multispecies adulteration is a commonly used
strategy to mask the traditional adulteration detection methods. Most of the
researchers were only concerned about single targeted adulterants, however, it
was difficult to identify complex multispecies adulteration or untargeted
adulterants. To detect adulteration of edible oil, identification of
characteristic markers of adulterants was proposed to be an effective method,
which could provide a solution for multispecies adulteration detection. In this
study, a simple method of multispecies adulteration detection for camellia oil
(adulterated with soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil) was developed by
quantifying chemical markers including four isoflavones, trans-resveratrol and
sinapic acid, which used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) combined with solid phase extraction (SPE). In commercial camellia
oil, only two of them were detected of daidzin with the average content of 0.06
ng/g while other markers were absent. The developed method was highly sensitive
as the limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.02 ng/mL to 0.16 ng/mL and the
mean recoveries ranged from 79.7% to 113.5%, indicating that this method was
reliable to detect potential characteristic markers in edible oils. Six target
compounds for pure camellia oils, soybean oils, peanut oils and rapeseed oils had
been analyzed to get the results. The validation results indicated that this
simple and rapid method was successfully employed to determine multispecies
adulteration of camellia oil adulterated with soybean, peanut and rapeseed oils.

This study assessed the effect of whey protein substitution with isolated soy
protein in protein bar (PB) formulations at 25% (PB2), 50% (PB3), or 75% (PB1)
weight/weight on the proximate and mineral composition, sensory, and antidiabetic
properties. Sensory evaluation was conducted within diabetic (DB) and
non-diabetic (NDB) consumers by preference ranking and acceptance test. The
formulations were analysed in terms of moisture, ash, protein, lipid,
carbohydrates, fibers and mineral content. The consumers did not distinguish the 
formulations by preference ranking test. However, the acceptability test showed a
rating of 9 most frequent for PB1 (36.30%), followed by PB2 and PB3 (both
34.09%), among DB consumers. The PB1 and PB3 showed higher content of total,
soluble and insoluble fibers and, PB 2 presented higher carbohydrate content.
Potassium, sodium and calcium showed the highest mineral content in the
formulations. PB3 was assessed for glycaemic and lipidemic control in diabetics
and non-diabetics female Wistar rats, for this 20% of PB was added in the ration 
consumed ad libitum, besides, the rats received 100&nbsp;mg/kg b. w. by gavage daily. 
The treatment did not reduce significantly fasting glucose, lipid profile, or
peripheral glucose disposal in DB or NDB rats. However, it significantly improved
insulin tolerance test values in diabetic rats. The results suggest that the
formulations showed good acceptance and potentially ameliorate insulin resistance
both in control group and in animal model of type II diabetes.

In this study, we compared the antiobesity effects between gochujangs prepared
using different koji products and Tabasco hot sauce in rats fed a high-fat diet
(HFD). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed HFD containing four different types of
10% gochujang powder or 0.25% commercial Tabasco sauce powder for 8 weeks. The
body weight gain, liver and epididymal and mesenteric fat pad weights, serum
leptin levels, and lipogenesis-related mRNA levels of HFD-gochujang
supplementation groups were significantly decreased compared with those of the
HFD group. In addition, gochujang supplement significantly reduced adipocyte
size; hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol levels; the occurrence of fatty 
liver deposits and steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis through downregulation of 
fatty acid synthase, acetly-CoA carboxylase, and
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase. These effects were greater in the
gochujang-supplemented groups than the Tabasco hot sauce-supplemented group. The 
gochujang prepared by nutritious giant embryo rice koji and soybean koji was most
effective in terms of antiobesity effects, compared with the other tested
gochujangs. In gochujangs, the antiobesity effects are mediated by high levels of
secondary metabolites such as isoflavone, soyasaponin, capsaicin, and
lysophosphatidylcholine. The current results indicated that the gochujang
products have the potential to reduce fat accumulation and obesity.

Data were derived from the National Institute for Longevity Sciences-Longitudinal
Study of Aging. Subjects comprised 403 men and 373 women aged 60-81 years at
baseline who participated in the follow-up study at least once. Bean, soy product
and soy isoflavone intake was assessed using a 3-day dietary record at baseline. 
Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE
scores of ≤23 were used to define cognitive impairment. The relationship between 
bean, soy product and soy isoflavone intake and cognitive impairment was assessed
using a generalized estimating equation. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95%
confidence intervals) for cognitive impairment with a 1 s.d. increase in total
bean, total soybean and total soy isoflavone intakes were 0.48 (0.28-0.81;
p = 0.006), 0.51 (0.32-0.83; p = 0.007), and 0.55 (0.32-0.93; p = 0.026),
respectively, in women. Total soybean and soy isoflavone intake might decrease
the risk of cognitive impairment in elderly Japanese women.

Soy is a basic food ingredient of traditional Asian cuisine used for thousands of
years. In Western countries, soybeans have been introduced about a hundred years 
ago and recently they are mainly used for surrogate foods production. Soy and soy
foods are common nutritional solutions for vegetarians, due to their high protein
content and versatility in the production of meat analogues and milk substitutes.
However, there are some doubts about the potential effects on health, such as the
effectiveness on cardiovascular risk reduction or, conversely, on the possible
disruption of thyroid function and sexual hormones. The soy components that have 
stimulated the most research interest are isoflavones, which are polyphenols with
estrogenic properties highly contained in soybeans. In this review, we discuss
the characteristics of soy and soy foods, focusing on their nutrient content,
including phytoestrogens and other bioactive substances that are noteworthy for
vegetarians, the largest soy consumers in the Western countries. The safety of
use will also be discussed, given the growing trend in adoption of vegetarian
styles and the new soy-based foods availability.

The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial communities and
health-benefit-related parameters in doenjang prepared with various brine
concentrations (8, 12, 16, and 20%). Phenolic, flavonoid, melanoidin and
isoflavone contents, antioxidation, and antiproliferation of doenjang (AD8, AD12,
AD16, and AD20) aged for 3 months were compared with those of initial doenjang
(ID8, ID12, ID16, and ID20). The ID8 and AD8 doenjang, made with 8% brine,
contained higher phenolics, melanoidins, and isoflavones than those with high
salinity. As results of bacterial communities, Enterococcus was a dominant
bacterium in most doenjang, while Lactobacillus was predominant in AD8. Trolox
equivalent antioxidant capacity (32.5 µmol TE/g dwb) and DPPH radical-scavenging 
capacity (57 µmol TE/g dwb) values of AD8 were the highest among samples. The
EC50 of HT-29 cell proliferation treated with AD8 was 0.47 mg/mL, while EC50 of
AD20 was 1.07 mg/mL, indicating stronger antiproliferative activity in
low-salinity doenjang.

The aim of the study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of soybean
isoflavones (SI) on testicular cell apoptosis in mice with type-2 diabetes, as
well as any possible mechanisms of action. Thirty male C57BL/6J mice were
randomly divided into the control, diabetic (model), and treatment (SI) groups
(n=10 each). After treatment for 20 weeks, testicular cell apoptosis was detected
and evaluated using DAPI staining. The expression and distribution of caspase-3
protein in testicular tissues was detected via immunohistochemistry, while
caspase-3 mRNA expression was detected using RT-PCR. Bax and Bcl-2 protein
expression was detected by western blot analysis. At week 20, DAPI staining
showed that SI treatment significantly decreased testicular tissue cell apoptosis
in diabetic mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that caspase-3 expression
in the SI group was significantly reduced relative to the model group. RT-PCR
showed that SI treatment significantly decreased caspase-3 mRNA expression
relative to the model group. Western blot analysis revealed that SI treatment
significantly decreased Bax protein expression and increased Bcl-2 protein
expression (P&lt;0.01). SI exhibited an inhibitory effect on testicular tissue cell 
apoptosis in mice with type 2 diabetes, with this effect possibly mediated by a
decreased expression of caspase-3 and Bax and increased Bcl-2 protein expression.

Fermented soybeans, cheonggukjang (CKJ), are considered to be more wholesome than
soybeans in Korea. To select the best soybean cultivar for making functional CKJ,
a comparison was made between the biological activities of four soybean cultivars
in their unfermented soybean (UFS) and CKJ states. Changes in
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity, 2,2'-azino-bis 
(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays, superoxide dismutase
(SOD)-like activity, total phenolic compounds, total amino acids, and isoflavones
were investigated. The levels of DPPH, ABTS, SOD-like activity, and total
phenolic compounds increased in CKJ among all cultivars. The isoflavone aglycone 
and total amino acids showed the highest amount in CKJ prepared from soybean
cultivar Aga 3. These results suggest that the improved antioxidant activity of
CKJ in all cultivars might occur because of the higher levels of aglycones and
total phenolic compounds achieved during fermentation. Moreover, CKJ prepared
from soybean cultivar Aga 3 showed higher antioxidant activity than the other
cultivars and so can be considered for the commercial production of functional
foods in the future.

AIM: Consumption of soy isoflavones reduces the risk of estrogen-related
diseases, such as menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. 
Equol is metabolized from the isoflavone daidzein by intestinal bacteria and has 
higher bioavailability than other isoflavones. Equol producers are believed to
benefit from soybean consumption to a greater extent than non-producers.
Recently, we showed that equol non-producers were at significant risk of
premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Previously, we reported that PMS is a common
menstrual problem in female athletes, and almost half of the studied athletes
felt a negative effect of premenstrual symptoms on their athletic performance.
This study was conducted to evaluate the relation between PMS and equol
production status in Japanese collegiate athletes.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study that included 88
Japanese female collegiate athletes. Equol production status was determined using
urine samples collected after a soy challenge test. The subjects also completed a
questionnaire about their premenstrual symptoms and their competitive career.
RESULTS: The prevalence of equol producers was 29.5% in Japanese collegiate
athletes. The athletic performance of 54.5% of athletes was found to suffer in
competition or in practice due to premenstrual symptoms. In multivariate
analysis, equol non-producers (odds ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval,
1.03-12.20) and restriction of bodyweight (odds ratio, 4.94; 95% confidence
interval, 1.47-20.00) were shown to be significant risk factors for poor athletic
performance.
CONCLUSION: This study showed a relation between athletic performance and equol
production status in Japanese collegiate athletes.

Since estrogenic pollutants and phytoestrogens can cause the disorder of the
reproductive system, the effects of a soybean milk product (Vegemil&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;
containing 162 ppm isoflavones) on the feto-neonatal development, including male 
reproductive function, were investigated. Pregnant rats were fed the soybean milk
(5% or 100% in drinking water) from gestational day (GD) 6 to parturition or to
post-natal day (PND) 56. Specifically, the rats were divided into 4 groups: the
control group (drinking water), the GD5% group (5% soybean milk during only the
GD period), the GD-PND5% group (5% soybean milk during the GD and PND periods),
and the GD-PND100% group (100% soybean milk instead of water during the GD and
PND periods). During the gestational, lactational, and developmental periods, the
reproductive and developmental parameters of dams and offspring were observed.
Feeding soybean milk did not affect the birth and physical development of both
male and female offspring. At PND57, the weights of the testes and epididymides
of F1 males significantly increased by feeding a high concentration of the
soybean milk (GD-PND100%). In addition, feeding of the soybean milk during both
the GD and PND periods (GD-PND5% and GD-PND100%) enhanced the sperm counts and
motility. The results indicate that soybean milk is safe for embryos, fetuses,
and offspring, and improves the post-generational development of male
reproductive function.

Root exudates are plant metabolites secreted from the roots into the soil. These 
exudates are involved in many important biological processes, including
acquisition of nutrients, defense and signaling to rhizosphere bacteria, such as 
isoflavones of soybean crucial for the symbiosis with rhizobium. Less is known,
however, about other types of root exudates. This study shows that soybean roots 
secrete large amounts of soyasaponins (triterpenoid glycosides) as root exudates.
The soyasaponins are classified into four groups, with group A being the most
secreted of these compounds, whereas DDMP
(2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one) soyasaponins is the group
showing greatest accumulation in root tissues, suggesting a selection system for 
secreted compounds. Time-course experiments showed that the soyasaponin secretion
peaked during early vegetative stages. In particular, soyasaponin Ah was the
major compound secreted by soybean roots, whereas the deacetylated derivative Af 
was the major compound secreted specifically during the VE stage. The secretion
of soyasaponins containing glycosyl moieties is an apparent loss of
photosynthates. This phenomenon has been also observed in other legume species,
although the composition of secreted soyasaponins is plant species dependent. The
identification of triterpenoid saponins as major metabolites in legume root
exudates will provide novel insights into chemical signaling in the rhizosphere
between plants and other organisms.

Soybean isoflavones have been one of the potential preventive candidates for
antitumor research in recent years. In this paper, we first studied the
transformation of soybean isoflavones with the homogenized slurry of Ganoderma
lucidum. The resultant transformed products (TSI) contained (703.21±4.35) mg/g of
genistein, with transformed rates of 96.63% and 87.82% of daidzein and genistein,
respectively, and TSI also could enrich the bioactive metabolites of G. lucidum. 
The antitumor effects of TSI on human colorectal cancer cell line HTL-9, human
breast cancer cell line MCF-7, and human immortalized gastric epithelial cell
line GES-1 were also studied. The
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
showed that TSI could dramatically reduce the viability rates of HTL-9 cells and 
MCF-7 cells without detectable cytotoxicity on GES-1 normal cells when the TSI
concentration was lower than 100 μg/ml. With 100 μg/ml of TSI, HTL-9 cells were
arrested in the G1 phase, and late-apoptosis was primarily induced, accompanied
with partial early-apoptosis. TSI could induce primarily early-apoptosis by
arresting cells in the G1 phase of MCF-7 cells. For HTL-9 cells, Western-blot and
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that TSI
(100 μg/ml) can up-regulate the expression of Bax, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and
cytochrome c (Cyto-c), indicating that TSI could induce cell apoptosis mainly
through the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, the expression of p53 was
up-regulated, while the expression of Survivin and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was 
down-regulated. All these results showed that TSI could induce apoptosis of HTL-9
cells by the regulation of multiple apoptosis-related genes.

KEY MESSAGE: Fifteen stable QTLs were identified using a high-density soybean
genetic map across multiple environments. One major QTL, qIF5-1, contributing to 
total isoflavone content explained phenotypic variance 49.38, 43.27, 46.59, 45.15
and 52.50%, respectively. Soybeans (Glycine max L.) are a major source of dietary
isoflavones. To identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying
isoflavone content, and to improve the accuracy of marker-assisted breeding in
soybean, a valuable mapping population comprised of 196 F7:8-10 recombinant
inbred lines (RILs, Huachun 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;Wayao) was utilized to evaluate individual and
total isoflavone content in plants grown in four different environments in
Guangdong. A high-density genetic linkage map containing 3469 recombination bin
markers based on 0.2&nbsp;×&nbsp;restriction site-associated DNA tag sequencing (RAD-seq)
technology was used to finely map QTLs for both individual and total isoflavone
contents. Correlation analyses showed that total isoflavone content, and that of 
five individual isoflavone, was significantly correlated across the four
environments. Based on the high-density genetic linkage map, a total of 15 stable
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with isoflavone content across multiple
environments were mapped onto chromosomes 02, 05, 07, 09, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, and
19. Further, one of them, qIF5-1, localized to chromosomes 05
(38,434,171-39,045,620&nbsp;bp) contributed to almost all isoflavone components across
all environments, and explained 6.37-59.95% of the phenotypic variance,
especially explained 49.38, 43.27, 46.59, 45.15 and 52.50% for total isoflavone. 
The results obtained in the present study will pave the way for a better
understanding of the genetics of isoflavone accumulation and reveals the scope
available for improvement of isoflavone content through marker-assisted
selection.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the action of soy isoflavones and 17 
beta estradiol on the extracellular matrix in the uterus and mammary gland of
diabetic rats. Sixty adult female rats underwent ovariectomy, then randomized
into seven groups of ten animals each: Non-diabetic: GI Sham control animals
ovariectomized; and GII control ovariectomized that received propylene glycol
vehicle. Diabetic: GIII Sham control diabetic animals ovariectomized; GIV
ovariectomized diabetic animals receiving propylene glycol vehicle; GV diabetic
ovariectomized animals treated with soy isoflavones (150 mg/kg by gavage); GVI
ovariectomized diabetic rats treated with estrogen (17b-estradiol, 10 mg/kg,
subcutaneously); GVII diabetic ovariectomized animals treated with soy
isoflavones (150 mg/kg by gavage), and with estrogen (17b-estradiol, 10 mg/kg
combination therapy). Treatments occurred during 30 consecutive days. After
animals euthanasia, a portion of the uterus was immersed in liquid nitrogen for
molecular biology analysis, the other portion of uterus and mammary glands were
removed and processed for paraffin embedding. Soy isoflavones (GV) and 17b
estradiol improved the production of compounds of extracellular matrix, such as
small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs). The combination of both therapies had
an additive effect in SLRPs expression. Soy isoflavones contribute to the uterine
integrity of SLRPs of diabetic rats.

Previous studies have shown that fermentations can enhance the bioactivity and
absorption rate of soybean products. Fermented soybean products can alleviate
hyperlipidemia and decrease risks of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases.
This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of soymilk fermented
by Lactococcus acidophilus on blood lipids and antioxidant enzyme activities of
rats fed with a high fat diet. Sixty rats were randomly assigned to six groups:
normal control group (NC), high-fat control group (HFC), positive control group
(cholestyramine, PC), Lactococcus acidophilus group (LA), soymilk group (SM), and
fermented soymilk group (FSM), respectively. The NC group was fed with a basic
diet, while the other groups were fed with a high-fat diet. After the
experimental period (6 W), rats were sacrificed by decapitation. Blood and liver 
were collected to measure the concentrations of lipids and antioxidant enzyme
activities. Results demonstrated that fermented soymilk could regulate lipid
levels, restore HDL-c and TG to normal levels, and lower the concentrations of
LDL-c than hypolipidemic drugs in hyperlipidemia rats. More importantly,
fermented soymilk caused significant reduction in arteriosclerosis index and
coronary risk index. Fermented soymilk also improved antioxidant capacities of
hyperlipidemia rats. The increase of aglycone isoflavones in fermented soymilk
could explain the above phenomena. In conclusion, soymilk fermented by
Lactococcus acidophilus reduced risks of arteriosclerosis and coronary heart
disease by regulating lipid levels and improving the antioxidant capacities of
hyperlipidemia rats.

Equol, a metabolite of soybean isoflavone daidzein, has been proven to have
various bioactivities related to human health, but little is known on its
antifungal activity to plant fungal pathogens. Magnaporthe oryzae is a
phytopathogenic fungus that causes rice blast, a devastating disease on rice.
Here, we demonstrated that equol influences the development and pathogenicity of 
M. oryzae. Equol showed a significant inhibition to the mycelial growth, conidial
generation and germination, and appressorial formation of M. oryzae. As a result,
equol greatly reduced the virulence of M. oryzae on rice and barley leaves. The
antifungal activity of equol was also found in several other plant fungal
pathogens. These findings expand our knowledge on the bioactivities of equol.

Complicated purification steps, together with the fact that β-glucosidase has to 
be tolerant to ethanol restricts the application of β-glucosidase in isoflavone
aglycone hydrolyzing process. β-Glucosidase Bgl1A(A24S/F297Y) is a promising
enzyme in hydrolyzing isoflavones. In this work, six different
carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which were from 3 families, were fused to
the C-terminal of Bgl1A(A24S/F297Y), respectively, to simplify the enzyme
preparation process. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and
adsorbed onto cellulose. The Bgl-CBM24 was found to have the highest
immobilization efficiency at room temperature within 1&nbsp;h adsorption. Notably, 1-g
cellulose absorbs up to 254.9±5.7 U of Bgl-CBM24. Interestingly, the immobilized 
Bgl-CBM24 showed improved ethanol tolerance ability, with the IC50 of 35% (v/v)
ethanol. Bgl-CBM24 effectively hydrolyze soybean isoflavone glycosides. The
hydrolysis rate of daidzin and gemistin was 85.22±3.24% and 82.14±3.82% within
10&nbsp;min, with the concentrations of daidzein and genistein increased by
6.36±0.18&nbsp;mM and 3.98±0.22&nbsp;mM, respectively. In the repetitive hydrolytic cycles,
the concentrations of daidzein and genistein still increased by 3.07±0.24&nbsp;mM and 
1.94±0.34&nbsp;mM in the fourth cycle with 20% (v/v) ethanol. These results suggest
that the immobilized Bgl-CBM24 has excellent potential in the preparation of
isoflavone aglycones.

The objective of this study was evaluate the effects of moisture and temperature 
during grain storage on the functional properties and isoflavone profile of soy
protein concentrate. The protein concentrate was extracted from soybeans on the
first day of storage and after 12months of storage, at 12 and 15% moisture and at
temperatures of 11, 18, 25, and 32°C. The protein concentrate obtained from
grains stored at 32°C showed decreased extraction yield (51.6% with 15% of
moisture) and protein solubility (24.8% with 15% of moisture) with increased
emulsifying capacity (52.2% with 12% of moisture) and foam formation, compared
with sample obtained at the start of the storage period. The isoflavone profile
showed a decrease in the concentrations of glycosylated, malonyl, and acetyl
isoflavones and a corresponding increase in the concentrations of aglycone
isoflavones, with the magnitude of these changes increasing with increasing
storage temperature and moisture content.

BACKGROUND: Studies on the relationship between vegetarian diet and breast cancer
in Asian populations are limited. This study aimed to investigate the
relationship between vegetarian diet, dietary patterns, and breast cancer in
Taiwanese women.
METHODS: This case-control study compared the dietary patterns of 233 breast
cancer patients and 236 age-matched controls. A questionnaire about vegetarian
diets and 28 frequently-consumed food items was administered to these 469
patients in the surgical department of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital. Serum biochemical
status was also examined.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups for age,
education, family history, oral contraceptive usage, or regular exercise.
However, the cancer group presented with both a higher body mass index and an
older age of primiparity (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Two food items (shellfish and seafood) were 
highly correlated (correlation coefficient&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.77), so shellfish was excluded to 
avoid multicollinearity. A factor analysis of 27 food items produced five dietary
patterns: meat, processed meat, fruit/vegetable/soybean, dessert/sugar, and
fermented food. Multivariate logistic regression showed that meat/fat and
processed meat dietary patterns were associated with breast cancer risk (odds
ratio (OR): 2.22, 95% CI 1.67-2.94, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001; OR: 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.04,
P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.013, respectively). Vegetarian diet, high isoflavone intake, and high
albumin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05).
Vegetarians had a higher daily soy isoflavone intake than non-vegetarians
(25.9&nbsp;±&nbsp;25.6&nbsp;mg vs. 18.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;15.6&nbsp;mg, P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Vegetarian diets show as protective role against breast cancer risk,
while meat and processed meat dietary patterns are associated with a higher
breast cancer risk.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOSESIS: Soybean isoflavones have been shown to reduce the risk 
of cerebral infarction in humans according to epidemiological studies. However,
whether intake of miso can reduce the incidence of stroke in animal models
remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of soybean paste
(miso) in an animal model of stroke.
METHODS: Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were fed a miso
diet (normal diet 90%, miso 10%; final NaCl content 2.8%), a high salt diet
(normal diet and NaCl 2.5%; final NaCl content 2.8%), or a low salt diet (normal 
diet; final NaCl content 0.3%).
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a significantly lower survival
rate in the high salt group compared to the miso group (P = 0.002) and the low
salt group (P ≤ 0.001). Large hemorrhagic macules were found in the cerebrum in
the high salt group, whereas none were found in the other 2 groups. There were
also fewer histological and immunohistochemical changes in the brain and kidneys 
in the miso group compared to the high salt group.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that miso may have protective effects against
stroke despite its high salt content.

SCOPE: Cheonggukjang (CGJ) is a soybean-based quick-fermented food popular in
Korea that contains a variety of biologically active compounds including
isoflavones and saponins. Isoflavone bioavailability may be important for the
bone health of postmenopausal women; therefore, the aim of this study is to
evaluate the influence of fermentation on the isoflavone metabolite nutrikinetic 
profile after single dose CGJ or unfermented soybean administration in
ovariectomized (OVX) and sham mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identify 34 isoflavone metabolites using UPLC-QTOF-MS and
analyze their nutrikinetics at different time points (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 
and 24 h) to understand their fermentation- and OVX-mediated time-dependent
concentration changes. Nutrikinetics analysis shows that genistein, daidzein,
genistein 4'-sulfate, dihydrodaidzein sulfate, equol 4'-sulfate, and
equol-7-glucuronide are present at high concentrations in all groups based on
area-under-the-curve analysis. OVX mice appear to show lower isoflavone
bioavailability than mice in the sham group. CGJ enhances various isoflavone
metabolite bioavailability including genistein, 3-hydroxygenistein, and equol
7-glucuronide, compared to the unfermented soybean-treated group. Among these
metabolites, intact isoflavones, 3-hydroxygenistein, genistein 4'-sulfate, and
equol 7-glucuronide promote osteoblastogenesis and inhibit osteoclast formation.
CONCLUSIONS: CGJ has good isoflavone bioavailability and may be beneficial for
the bone health of postmenopausal women.

A new high-throughput method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of
isoflavones and soyasaponnins in Soy (Glycine max L.) products by
high-performance thin-layer chromatography with densitometry and multiple
detection. Silica gel was used as the stationary phase and ethyl
acetate:methanol:water:acetic acid (100:20:16:1, v/v/v/v) as the mobile phase.
After chromatographic development, multi-wavelength scanning was carried out by: 
(i) UV-absorbance measurement at 265 nm for genistin, daidzin and glycitin, (ii) 
Vis-absorbance measurement at 650 nm for Soyasaponins I and III, after
post-chromatographic derivatization with anisaldehyde/sulfuric acid reagent.
Validation of the developed method was found to meet the acceptance criteria
delineated by ICH guidelines with respect to linearity, accuracy, precision,
specificity and robustness. Calibrations were linear with correlation
coefficients of &gt;0.994. Intra-day precisions relative standard deviation (RSD)%
of all substances in matrix were determined to be between 0.7 and 0.9%, while
inter-day precisions (RSD%) ranged between 1.2 and 1.8%. The validated method was
successfully applied for determination of the studied analytes in soy-based
infant formula and soybean products. The new method compares favorably to other
reported methods in being as accurate and precise and in the same time more
feasible and cost-effective.

Female Wistar rats were treated with orally administered soy isoflavones at
concentrations of 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg body weight from weaning until sexual
maturity (3 mo.), and ovarian steroidogenesis was evaluated. After soy
isoflavones were administered, a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease (44%) in the serum
estrodial levels of the high-dose (HD) group were observed. Cultured granulosa
cells from the middle- (MD) and HD groups showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced
(31%, 45%, respectively) in vitro estradiol secretion, and those from the HD
group showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced progesterone (25%) secretion.
Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression of the steroidogenic acute
regulatory protein (Star), cytochromeP450 cholesterol side chain cleavage
(Cyp11a1 and Cyp19a1), and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3b (Hsd3b) genes also
decreased. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed a significant
(P&lt;0.05) decrease in key transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)
expression in the HD group. The detection of DNA methylation using
bisulfitesequencing PCR (BSP) suggested a significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased total 
methylation rate in the proximal SF-1 promoter in the HD group. Further studies
showed that treatment with soy isoflavones can significantly (P&lt;0.05) increase
the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3a. This study
proved that soy isoflavone administration from weaning until sexual maturity
could inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis, suggesting that SF-1 might play an
important role in this effect. In addition, DNA methylation might play a role in 
the downregulation of SF-1 gene expression induced by soy isoflavones.

Introduction: The flavonoids comprise a diverse group of polyphenolic compounds
with antioxidant activity that is
present in edible plants like soybeans and soy products. In vivo studies have
concentrated on the effects of flavonoids
on cancer and genistein (GE), a soy-derived isoflavone, has been reported to
reduce prostate, colon, hepatic and breast
adenocarcinoma risk. Tamoxifen (TAM) is an important drug for cancer treatment
worldwide, which can induce apoptosis
in various cancers, including examples in the liver, breast and ovaries. The aim 
of the present study was to evaluate the
effects of GE and TAM, alone and in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis
in the human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) HepG2 cell line. Materials and Methods: HepG 2 cells were treated with GE, 
TAM and GE/TAM and then
MTT and flow cytometry assays were conducted to determine effects on viability
and apoptosis, respectively. Results:
GE and TAM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in the HepG 2 cell 
lines. Discussion: Our findings
clearly indicated that GE and TAM may exert inhibitory and apoptotic effects in
liver cancer cells. Conclusion: GE
and TAM can significantly inhibit growth of HCC cells and play a significant role
in apoptosis.

Among many functional foods and their phytochemicals, ingestion of soybean
(Glycine max) is highly correlated to reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Validation of potential health benefits of functional foods requires information 
about the bioavailability and metabolism of bioactive compounds. In this context,
several phase I and II metabolites of isoflavones were target-analyzed in the
plasma of rats acutely supplemented with soybean embryo extract. A daidzein
metabolite, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone (7,8,4'-THI), was found to have the
highest average area under curve value (574.3±112.8). Therefore, its potential
prevention effect on atherosclerosis was investigated using monocyte-endothelial 
cell adhesion assay. Different from its precursor daidzein or daidzin, 7,8,4'-THI
attenuated adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)
stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition,
7,8,4'-THI significantly downregulated TNF-α stimulated the expression of
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and
phosphorylation of IκB kinase and IκBα involved in the initiation of
atherosclerosis in HUVECs. Therefore, 7,8,4'-THI, a highly bioavailable
hydroxylated isoflavone metabolite, has potential anti-atherosclerotic effect via
inhibiting monocyte-endothelial adhesion.

Prenylated phenolics from the Fabaceae are promising lead compounds for new
antibacterials. Pools enriched in prenylated phenolics were made from lupine,
peanut and soybean seedlings. One pool was rich in chain prenylated isoflavones
(cIsf), one in chain prenylated stilbenoids (cSti), one in chain prenylated
(cPta) and one in ring-closed prenylated pterocarpans (rPta), as characterized by
RP-UHPLC-UV-MS. Antibacterial activity of the pools and membrane permeabilization
was investigated. Pools showed high antibacterial activity against Listeria
monocytogenes: cIsf pool had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10µg/ml
prenylated compounds, followed by cPta pool (25µg/ml) and cSti pool (35µg/ml).
Activity against E. coli was found only when the pools were co-administered with 
an efflux pump inhibitor. The pool enriched in chain prenylated isoflavones
permeabilized the bacterial membrane within minutes of exposure, whereas
ampicillin did not. Bent conformation and chain prenylation, were molecular
features of main prenylated phenolics found in pools with high antibacterial
activity.

This study investigated the effects of the ultrahigh pressure homogenization
(pressure, protein concentration, oil phase fraction, pH, temperature, and ionic 
strength) and storage on the properties of nanoemulsions (100-500nm range), which
were stabilized by laboratory-prepared soybean protein isolate (SPI),
β-conglycinin (7S) and glycinin (11S). The nanoemulsions made with SPI, 7S and
11S proteins exhibited considerable stability over various ionic strengths
(0-500mM NaCl), pH (&lt;4 or &gt;7), thermal treatments (30-60°C) and storage
(0-45days). The far-UV spectra of SPI, 7S, 11S dispersions, and SPI-, 7S-, 11S
protein-stabilized nanoemulsions were analyzed for the protein structural changes
following lipid removal. The ultra-high pressure homogenization changed the
secondary structure of SPI, 7S, 11S proteins in the nanoemulsions, and enhanced
their stability. This study demonstrated that SPI, 7S, and 11S proteins can be
used as effective emulsifiers in nanoemulsions prepared by ultra-high pressure
homogenization.

The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in the nitric oxide-guanosine
3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (NO-cGMP)-induced isoflavone production in soybean
sprouts was examined. Inhibitors and donors of NO, cGMP, and GSK-3 inhibitor were
added to UV-B irradiated sprouts. Results showed that NO, with cGMP, induced the 
expression of GSK-3 under UV-B radiation. Protein kinase G (PKG) was shown to be 
involved in NO-cGMP-induced GSK-3 activation. GSK-3 elevated activity and
expression levels of chalcone synthase (CHS) and isoflavone synthase (IFS), and
increased isoflavone accumulation.

soybean milk was investigated in this study. Beta-glucosidase, which was
covalently immobilized onto cellulose beads, exhibited a significant efficiency
for the conversion of 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucuronide to p-nitrophenol over the
sol-gel method. The Michaelis constant (Km) of the cellulose bead enzymatic
system was determined to be 1.50±0.10 mM. Operational reusability of the
cellulose bead enzymatic system was justified for more than 10 batch reactions in
black soy milk. Moreover, the storage stability verification indicated that the
cellulose bead catalytic system was able to sustain its highest catalytic
activity for 10 days. High-performance liquid chromatography results demonstrated
that this enzymatic system required only 30 minutes to achieve complete
isoflavone deglycosylation, and the aglycone content in the total isoflavones in 
black soy milk was enriched by 67% within 30 minutes by the cellulose bead
enzymatic system.

Recently, soybean isoflavone aglycones (i.e., daidzein and genistein) and
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have begun to receive considerable consumer attention 
owing to their potential as nutraceuticals. To produce these ingredients,
multiple microorganisms and their enzymes are commonly used for catalysis in the 
nutraceutical industry. In this work, we introduce a novel fermentation process
that uses whole-cell biocatalysis to accelerate GABA and isoflavone aglycone
production in doenjang (a traditional Korean soybean paste). Microbial enzymes
transform soybean isoflavone glycosides (i.e., daidzin and genistin) and
monosodium glutamate into soybean isoflavone aglycones and GABA. Lactobacillus
brevis GABA 100 and Aspergillus oryzae KACC 40250 significantly reduced the
production time with the aid of a protease. The resulting levels of GABA and
daidzein were higher, and genistein production resembled the levels in
traditional doenjang fermented for over a year. Concentrations of GABA, daidzein,
and genistein were measured as 7,162, 60, and 59 μg/g, respectively on the
seventh day of fermentation. Our results demonstrate that the administration of
whole-cell L. brevis GABA 100 and A. oryzae KACC 40250 paired with a protease
treatment is an effective method to accelerate GABA, daidzein, and genistein
production in doenjang.

In this study, the preparation and structural properties of spiral dextrin
(SD)/vitamin E and SD/soy isoflavone inclusion complexes were studied. SD was
obtained from debranched normal maize starch using isoamylases. After
fractionation using a novel method of gradient ethanol precipitation, SD was
separated into different fractions, among which SD-40 was found to be the optimal
host molecule to prepare SD inclusion complexes with vitamin E or soy isoflavone.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) suggested that the crystalline structures of
SD-40/vitamin E and SD-40/soy isoflavone were V6II and V6III types, respectively.
Small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the SD-40/vitamin E inclusion complex 
formed a tighter and more compact crystallite than the SD-40/soy isoflavone
inclusion complex. Furthermore, the connection structures of inclusion complexes 
were investigated by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy NMR, 
indicating that part of vitamin E with an alkyl chain was encapsulated in the
helix cavity of SD-40, whereas the aromatic ring B of the soy isoflavone molecule
was complexed by the helix cavity and screw of SD.

Medicine, Nanchang, China.

BACKGROUND: Green vegetable soya beans, known as Maodou in China, are supplied as
vegetable-type fruits of the soybean plant. Previous study indicated that green
vegetable soya beans exhibited antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities.
However, the material basis and pharmacological activities of green soybean plant
were not unravelled clearly. In this study, we investigated the chemical
ingredients and their pharmacological activities.
RESULTS: Investigation of the chemical ingredients indicated that two new
isoflavones, 2'-hydroxyerythrin A (1), and
daidzein-7-O-β-d-{6″-[(E)-but-2-enoyl]}glycoside (2), together with seven known
ones&nbsp;-&nbsp;7,4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxyisoflavone (3), daidzein (4), daidzin (5),
genistein (6), formononetin (7), ononin (8), and isoerythrinin A (9)&nbsp;-&nbsp;were
obtained. The structures of compounds 1-9 were elucidated on the basis of
spectroscopic and chemical analysis. We evaluated the antimicrobial efficacies
and free-radical scavenging potential of the isolated compounds (1-9). Compounds 
1 and 9 exhibited the most pronounced efficacy against the tested bacterial
strains with IC50 values ranging from 10.6 to 22.6 μg mL-1 . The isolated
compounds showed moderate radical scavenging properties with compound 6 being the
most active, followed by compounds 3, 1 and 4.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the isoflavones from soya beans could be
considered as potential antioxidants or antimicrobials in the food, cosmetics and
pharmaceutical industries. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

BACKGROUND: Many people have thyroid conditions that make them susceptible to
hypothyroidism. If the foods they eat may interfere with the production of
thyroid hormone, which can lead to development of serious hypothyroidism. The
danger of health drinks should always be noted.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Japanese woman was previously diagnosed with
chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis caused by a goiter and had an elevated
thyroid-stimulating hormone level (6.56 μIU/ml), a high anti-thyroid peroxidase
antibody level (&gt;600&nbsp;IU/ml), and a high antithyroglobulin level (&gt; 4000&nbsp;IU/ml)
but normal levels of free triiodothyronine (3.08&nbsp;pg/ml) and thyroxine
(1.18&nbsp;ng/ml). She presented to our hospital with sudden-onset general malaise,
edema, and hoarseness with an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (373.3 μIU/ml)
level and very low triiodothyronine (&lt; 0.26&nbsp;pg/ml) and thyroxine (0.10&nbsp;ng/ml)
levels. It was determined that for 6&nbsp;months she had been consuming a processed,
solved health drink ("barley young leaf") in amounts of 9&nbsp;g/day, which included
soybean and kale powder extract. Hypothyroidism might be affected by ingredients 
of health drinks. She discontinued consumption of the health drink immediately
and began taking 12.5&nbsp;μg of levothyroxine. The amount of levothyroxine was
gradually increased every 3&nbsp;days up to 100&nbsp;μg. At day 61, her thyroid-stimulating
hormone level had decreased (6.12 μIU/ml), her free triiodothyronine (2.69&nbsp;pg/ml)
and thyroxine (1.56&nbsp;ng/ml) levels had increased, and her general condition was
improved. Among risky foods lowering thyroid function, some experimental studies 
have revealed that isoflavones reduce thyroid function. Therefore, we measured
the presence of isoflavones in the patient's frozen serum with thin-layer
chromatography. After she discontinued consumption of the health drink, two
components quickly disappeared, and the other three components gradually
decreased. On the basis of developing solvent composition and a positive ferric
chloride reaction in thin-layer chromatography experiment, the five ingredients
that disappeared or decreased were highly suspected to be soy isoflavones.
CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes that consuming health drinks that include soy
isoflavone powder extracts can lead to severe hypothyroidism.

Soybean sprouts are a major food item in Korea. Various studies have been carried
out to enhance their yield and nutritional values. The objective of the present
study was to examine the influence of persimmon fruit powder and Indolbi, a
synthetic plant growth regulator, on the yield and nutritional value of soybean
sprouts. Seeds were soaked in tap water containing 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0%
(w/v) persimmon fruit powder and the samples were named as PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, and 
PT-4, respectively. The yield increment was almost doubled in PT-3 and PT-4 than 
in the Indolbi treated sprouts on basis of the control. Vitamin C, isoflavones,
and total phenolic contents as well as antioxidant potentials (determined by
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and superoxide anion radical scavenging assays)
were also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in PT-3 compared to the Indolbi
treatment and the control. However, total free amino acid and magnesium contents 
of Indolbi- applied sprouts were higher than in the fruit powder treatments. The 
overall results of the present study showed that persimmon fruit powder can be an
option to enhance the yield and nutritional value of soybean sprouts since, due
to potential health hazards, the use of synthetic chemicals like Indolbi is less 
preferred than the natural products.

Leukotrienes (LTs), chemical mediators produced by mast cells, play an important 
role in allergic symptoms such as food allergies and hay fever. We tried to
construct an evaluation method for the anti-LTB4 activity of chemical substances 
using a mast cell line, PB-3c. PB-3c pre-cultured with or without arachidonic
acid (AA) was stimulated by calcium ionophore (A23187) for 20&nbsp;min, and LTB4
production by the cells was determined by HPLC with UV detection. LTB4 was not
detected when PB-3c was pre-cultured without AA. On the other hand, LTB4
production by PB-3c pre-cultured with AA was detectable by HPLC, and the optimal 
conditions of PB-3c for LTB4 detection were to utilize the cells pre-cultured
with 50&nbsp;µM AA for 48&nbsp;h. MK-886 (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor) completely inhibited
LTB4 production, but AACOCF3 (phospholipase A2 inhibitor) slightly increased LTB4
production, suggesting that LTB4 was generated from exogenous free AA through
5-lipoxygenase pathway. We applied this technique to the evaluation of the
anti-LTB4 activity of food components. PB-3c pre-cultured with 50&nbsp;µM AA for 48&nbsp;h 
was stimulated with A23187 in the presence of 50&nbsp;µM soybean isoflavones (daidzin,
genistin, daidzein, and genistein), equol, quercetin, or kaempferol. Genistein,
equol, quercetin, and kaempferol strongly inhibited LTB4 production without
cytotoxicity. These results suggest that a new assay system using PB-3c is
convenient to evaluate LTB4 inhibition activity by food components. This method
could be utilized for elucidation of the mechanisms of LTB4 release suppression
by food components such as flavonoids and the structure-activity relationship.

Natural phenols are an important functional compound widely distributed in plants
with benefits that promote human health. The content of total phenols,
flavonoids, and anthocyanins and their composition distribution in 18 soybean
cultivars was investigated. There are four phenolic acid distribution forms in
these soybean cultivars, namely free, esterified, glycosided, and
insoluble-bound. Total phenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins from 6 black soybean
cultivars were found in higher numbers than those from 12 other yellow soybean
cultivars. Free and esterified phenolic acids were the main phenolic acid form in
all 18 soybean samples. Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid were the dominant
phenolic acids in eight detected phenolic acids, and daidzin and genistin were
the abundant isoflavones in five detected isoflavones. Furthermore, the
antioxidant activities of total phenols from the 6 black soybean cultivars were
greater than those from the 12 yellow soybean cultivars, and there was a
significant positive correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolic 
content. Black soybeans could be a potential resource for developing natural
antioxidants that may play a crucial role in human health protection.

OBJECTIVES: Using ovariectomized rats, we examined the influence of combined
exercise tolerance and natto intake on the bone loss inhibitory effect.
METHODS: We divided female Wistar rats into the following groups: Ovariectomy,
Ovariectomy + Exercise, Ovariectomy + Natto Intake,
Ovariectomy + Exercise + Natto Intake, and Pseudo-operative (Sham group). After
conducting experiments on each group, we collected the tissues and performed
morphological and molecular biological analyses.
RESULTS: In comparison with the Ovariectomy group, only in the
Ovariectomy + Exercise group was there a significant bone loss inhibitory effect 
in the femoral cancellous bone. Although there was a tendency toward this trend
seen in the Natto Intake and Exercise + Natto Intake groups, these differences
were not significant. The increase in messenger RNA expression levels of alkaline
phosphatase (osteoblast marker) in the bone marrow caused by ovariectomy was
suppressed by individual factors, and by those in combination. However, messenger
RNA expression levels of estrogen receptor alpha in the bone marrow showed a
decreasing tendency with each factor, and decreased significantly with the
combination, similar to the Sham group.
CONCLUSION: This suggests that natto intake and exercise maintain bone mass by
different molecular mechanisms and that these two factors do not simply act
synergistically in combination to maintain bone mass.

Soyfoods have been intensely researched, primarily because they provide such
abundant amounts of isoflavones. Isoflavones are classified as both plant
estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Evidence suggests that
these soybean constituents are protective against a number of chronic diseases,
but they are not without controversy. In fact, because soyfoods contain such
large amounts of isoflavones, concerns have arisen that these foods may cause
untoward effects in some individuals. There is particular interest in
understanding the effects of isoflavones in young people. Relatively few studies 
involving children have been conducted, and many of those that have are small in 
size. While the data are limited, evidence suggests that soy does not exert
adverse hormonal effects in children or affect pubertal development. On the other
hand, there is intriguing evidence indicating that when soy is consumed during
childhood and/or adolescence, risk of developing breast cancer is markedly
reduced. Relatively few children are allergic to soy protein, and most of those
who initially are outgrow their soy allergy by 10 years of age. The totality of
the available evidence indicates that soyfoods can be healthful additions to the 
diets of children, but more research is required to allow definitive conclusions 
to be made.

Okara (soybean residue) is a highly perishable food processing by-product from
soymilk and tofu manufacture. It contains a large proportion of insoluble dietary
fibre (40-60% on a dry basis), as well as digestion-resistant proteins, trypsin
inhibitors and phytic acid. These factors contribute lead to the
under-utilisation of okara. To improve the overall nutritional quality of okara, 
sequential saccharification of okara by Celluclast® 1.5L (cellulase) or
Viscozyme® L (cellulase and hemicellulase) and fermentation by the yeast Yarrowia
lipolytica were performed. The changes in the antioxidant capacity, amino acids, 
phenolic acids, isoflavones, phytic acid and dietary fibre during
biotransformation were studied. Carbohydrase pre-treatment increased the amounts 
of monosaccharides, trans-cinnamic acid and aglycone isoflavones in okara. After 
fermentation, the okara had higher antioxidant activity and greater amounts of
total amino acids and ferulic acid. Some positive interactions between the
carbohydrase and Y. lipolytica were hypothesised: the carbohydrase and Y.
lipolytica proteases could have synergised with each other to break down the
okara secondary cell wall more efficiently. After 52 h, Celluclast® 1.5 L and
Viscozyme® L significantly reduced the insoluble dietary fibre content from 61.9 
± 0.6 to 45.6 ± 3.0% and 24.7 ± 0.3%, respectively (all w/w, dry basis), while
increasing the soluble dietary fibre content by about onefold. Both carbohydrases
also increased the amounts of monosaccharides, trans-cinnamic acid, and aglycone 
isoflavones in okara. The addition of Y. lipolytica led to a higher antioxidant
capacity and greater amounts of total amino acids and ferulic acid in okara. The 
overall improvements in the digestibility and potential health benefits of okara 
highlight the promising applicability of biotransformation in okara valorisation.

The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of nanonutraceuticals
(NN) for attenuation of neurobehavioral and neurochemical abnormalities in
Alzheimer's disease. Solid-state fermentation of soybean with Bacillus subtilis
was performed to produce different metabolites (nattokinase, daidzin, genistin
and glycitin and menaquinone-7). Intoxication of rats with colchicine caused
impairment in learning and memory which was demonstrated in neurobehavioral
paradigms (Morris water maze and passive avoidance) linked with decreased
activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). NN treatment led to a significant
increase in TLT in the retention trials as compared to acquisition trial TLT
suggesting an improved learning and memory in rats. Further, treatment of NN
caused an increase in the activity of AChE (42%), accompanied with a reduced
activity of glutathione (42%), superoxide dismutase (43%) and catalase (41%). It 
also decreased the level of lipid peroxidation (28%) and protein carbonyl
contents (30%) in hippocampus as compared to those treated with colchicine alone,
suggesting a possible neuroprotective efficacy of NN. Interestingly, in silico
studies also demonstrated an effective amyloid-β and BACE-1 inhibition activity. 
These findings clearly indicated that NN reversed colchicine-induced behavioral
and neurochemical alterations through potent antioxidant activity and could
possibly impart beneficial effects in cognitive defects associated with
Alzheimer's disease.

Lactobacillus plantarum C29-fermented defatted soybean (FDS), which contains
soyasaponins such as soyasaponin I (SI) and soyasapogenol B (SB) and isoflavones 
such as genistin (GE) and genistein (GT), attenuated memory impairment in mice.
Moreover, in the preliminary study, FDS and its soyasaponins and isoflavones
significantly inhibited NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. 
Therefore, we examined the effects of FDS and its constituents SI, SB, GT, and GE
on LPS-induced memory impairment in mice. Oral administration of FDS (80 mg/kg), 
which has higher concentrations of SB and GE than DS, recovered LPS-impaired
cognitive function in Y-maze (55.1 ± 3.5%) and passive avoidance tasks (50.9 ±
19.2 s) to 129.2% (74.1 ± 3.5%) and 114.2% (290.0 ± 22.4 s) of normal mice,
respectively (P &lt; 0.05). SB and GE (10 μM) also more potently attenuated
LPS-impaired cognitive behavior than SI and GT, respectively. SB (10 mg/kg) was
the most effective: treatment recovered LPS-impaired spontaneous alternation and 
latency time to 105.7% and 126.8% of normal control mice, respectively (P &lt;
0.05). SB and GE significantly increased BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation
in LPS-treated mice and corticosterone-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, SB 
and GE (10 μM) also significantly inhibited NF-κB activation in LPS-treated mice.
These findings suggested that FDS and its constituent soyasaponins and
isoflavones may attenuate memory impairment by the regulation of NF-κB-mediated
BDNF expression.

This study determined the level of phytonutrients in mungbean and soybean sprouts
compared to mature mungbean grain and vegetable soybean. The comparison included 
landraces and improved mungbean and soybean varieties to assess the effect of
breeding on the phytonutrient content of both crops. Sprouting mungbean enhanced 
vitamin C content 2.7-fold compared to mature mungbean grain. Relatively old
mungbean accessions were superior in protein, calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn),
carotenoid and vitamin C content compared to improved mungbean lines at the fully
mature stage. With regard to nutritional value, the vegetable soybean stage was
superior to soybean sprouts in terms of content of protein (14% increase), Zn
(45%), Ca (72%), and Fe (151%). Isoflavones, reported to have beneficial effects 
on human health, are found at high concentrations in soybean sprouts and could
easily provide the recommended anticarcinogenic dose range from 1.5 to 2.0mg/kg
of body weight per day.

Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC) is the major cause of heart failure. Conventional
medicine has been proved ineffective with adverse effects. Soybean presents
exciting adjunctive therapies and shows protective benefits for IC. However, the 
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Isoflavones are the main bioactive
components of soybean and may be protective against heart disease. Isoflavones
were extracted by using an acidic-ethanol method and analyzed by HPLC. All
patients with ischemic stroke were randomly and evenly assigned to two groups:
the isoflavone group (80 mg day-1, n = 100) and control group (80 mg day-1
placebo, n = 100), and the whole period of the experiment was 24 weeks. The
effects of soybean isoflavone on brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) were
measured. HPLC fractionation shows that isoflavone extracts are mainly composed
of 55% genistein, 23% daidzein, and 14% glycitein. Isoflavone therapy reduced
more levels of triglyceride and LDL-c in females than in males. FMD was higher in
the isoflavone group than in the control group after 24-week therapy (treatment
effect 2.0%, 95% CI 0.18-3.0, P = 0.01). The baseline differences were adjusted
in FMD and the isoflavone therapies were closely associated with the reduction of
FMD impairment at 24 weeks (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.85, P = 0.01). The
effects of isoflavone on brachial FMD were negatively associated with base FMD (r
= -0.65, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, isoflavone therapy caused a significant increase
in the levels of erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), superoxide dismutase (SOD)
and a significant decrease in serum levels of C-reactive protein, 8-isoprostane, 
malondialdehyde, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In contrast, the 
isoflavones had no effects on the levels of oxidation-related molecules when Nrf2
was silenced. These results suggest that soybean isoflavones ameliorate IC
patients by improving their antioxidant capacities via the upregulation of Nrf2.

Background: Randomized controlled studies have investigated the short-term effect
of soy product intake on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive people. To our
knowledge, no prospective studies exist on the effect of habitual intake of
fermented soy products, separate from total soy products, on BP in the general
population.Objective: We examined the association between the habitual intake of 
soy products, including fermented soy products, and the development of high BP
during a 5-y period among participants in a population-based prospective cohort
study in Japan.Methods: The study included normotensive participants aged 40-69 y
at baseline (926 men and 3239 women) who completed 2 questionnaires and whose BP 
was measured at the baseline survey between 1993 and 1994 and the 5-y follow-up
in the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study Cohort II. The intake
of soy products was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire. High BP was
defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm
Hg, or antihypertensive medication use. ORs and 95% CIs of high BP by frequency
of soy products (miso, natto, and tofu) consumption, intake of total and
fermented soy products, and intake of isoflavones from total and fermented soy
products were estimated with the use of multiple logistic regression
analysis.Results: Multivariable-adjusted ORs of high BP for the highest compared 
with the lowest tertile of total and fermented soy product intake were 1.03 (95% 
CI: 0.84, 1.25; P-trend = 0.786) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.92; P-trend = 0.009), 
respectively. The frequency of nonfermented soy product (tofu) intake was not
associated with the development of high BP (P-trend = 0.597).Conclusions: The
intake of fermented soy products, but not total or nonfermented soy products, was
inversely associated with developing high BP in men and women with normal BP.

AIM: The study is aimed at evaluating the chemosensitization and apoptotic effect
of aglycone rich extracts of dietary phytoestrogens (derived from soybean and
flaxseed) on estrogen receptor positive, MCF-7 and estrogen receptor negative,
MDA-MB-231 cells. The extracts show potent activity on both the cell lines,
hence, in silico studies have been carried out to find the possible reason for
their activity.
MAIN METHODS: MTT assay was carried to assess chemosensitization effect and
activated caspase-3/7 activity was studied using flow-cytometry and western
blotting. In silico studies were carried out using PharmMapper and the top hits
were taken up for docking using the Schrödinger software. Top molecular targets
were subjected to gene expression studies by qPCR and protein expression using
Western blot analysis.
KEY FINDINGS: This study reports the apoptotic activity and chemosensitization
effect of the phytoestrogens. Molecular docking studies predict AKR1B1 (aldose
reductase), HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma) and GSTP1 (glutathione s-transferase pi) as
potential molecular targets for genistein, daidzein and secoisolariciresinol,
respectively. Gene and protein expression studies show down-regulation of AKR1BI,
HRAS and GSTP1 by the extracts.
SIGNIFICANCE: The qPCR and western blot analysis results support the
computational analyses, and hence genistein, daidzein and secoisolariciresinol
may be considered as good candidates for future development into potent
inhibitors of the respective protein targets through medicinal chemistry
optimization.

The effect of soybean protein on blood pressure (BP) in postmenopausal women is
controversial, so we aimed to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 
published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate whether
supplementation with soy protein improves their blood pressure. PubMed and Embase
were searched up to February 2016. Weighted mean differences were calculated for 
net changes in BP by using fixed-effect or random-effect models. Subgroup and
meta-regression analyses were performed to clarify heterogeneity among the
trials. A total of twelve trials (1551 postmenopausal women participants) were
included in the present meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimates of the effect
of soy protein indicated a significant effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP)
(mean difference: -3.03 mmHg; 95% CI: -5.03, -1.02; P = 0.003) and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) (mean difference: -0.71 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.26, -0.16; P =
0.012). Subgroup analyses further demonstrated that soy protein intake ≥25 g d-1 
significantly reduced BP, and the mean difference in SBP and DBP was -4.62 mmHg
(95% CI: -8.42, -0.81; P = 0.04) and -1.63 mmHg (95% CI: -2.85, -0.41; P =
0.009), respectively. Soy isoflavone intake ≥100 mg d-1 had a better reduction
effect both in SBP (-5.47 mmHg; 95% CI: -8.42, -2.51; P = 0.00) and DBP (-2.03
mmHg; 95% CI: -3.35, -0.72; P = 0.002). However, soy protein intake &lt;25 g d-1 or 
soy isoflavone intake &lt;100 mg d-1 had no such effects (P &gt; 0.05). This
meta-analysis suggests that ingestion of ≥25 g soy protein per day has
BP-lowering effects, and the improvements in BP may be due to the isoflavones
component of soy protein. More high-quality RCTs need to be carried out to
confirm the present findings.

Ion beams are powerful mutagens that can induce novel mutants in plants. We
previously established a system for producing a mutant population of soybean via 
ion-beam irradiation, isolated plants that had chlorophyll deficiency, and
maintained their progeny via self-fertilization. Here we report the
characterization of the progeny plants in terms of chlorophyll content, flowering
time and isoflavone content in seeds. Chlorophyll deficiency in the leaf tissues 
was linked with reduced levels of isoflavones, the major flavonoid compounds
accumulated in soybean seeds, which suggested the involvement of metabolic
changes associated with the chlorophyll deficiency. Intriguingly, flowering time 
was frequently altered in plants that had a reduced level of chlorophyll in the
leaf tissues. Plant lines that flowered either earlier or later than the
wild-type plants were detected. The observed coincidental changes were presumed
to be attributable to the following origins: structural changes of DNA segments
leading to the loss of multiple gene functions, or indirect effects of mutations 
that affect one of these traits, which were manifested as phenotypic changes in
the background of the duplicated composition of the soybean genome.

BACKGROUND: Estrogen receptors (ER) α and β are found in both women and men in
many tissues, where they have different functions, including having roles in cell
proliferation and differentiation of the reproductive tract. In addition to
estradiol (E2), a natural hormone, numerous compounds are able to bind ERs and
modulate their activities. Among these compounds, phytoestrogens such as
isoflavones, which are found in plants, are promising therapeutics for several
pathologies. Glyceollins are second metabolites of isoflavones that are mainly
produced in soybean in response to an elicitor. They have potentially therapeutic
actions in breast cancer by reducing the proliferation of cancer cells. However, 
the molecular mechanisms driving these effects remain elusive.
METHODS: First, to determine the proliferative or anti-proliferative effects of
glyceollins, in vivo and in vitro approaches were used. The length of epithelial 
duct in mammary gland as well as uterotrophy after treatment by E2 and
glyceollins and their effect on proliferation of different breast cell line were 
assessed. Secondly, the ability of glyceollin to activate ER was assessed by
luciferase assay. Finally, to unravel molecular mechanisms involved by
glyceollins, transcriptomic analysis was performed on MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
RESULTS: In this study, we show that synthetic versions of glyceollin I and II
exert anti-proliferative effects in vivo in mouse mammary glands and in vitro in 
different ER-positive and ER-negative breast cell lines. Using transcriptomic
analysis, we produce for the first time an integrated view of gene regulation in 
response to glyceollins and reveal that these phytochemicals act through at least
two major pathways. One pathway involving FOXM1 and ERα is directly linked to
proliferation. The other involves the HIF family and reveals that stress is a
potential factor in the anti-proliferative effects of glyceollins due to its role
in increasing the expression of REDD1, an mTORC1 inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study clearly shows that glyceollins exert
anti-proliferative effects by reducing the expression of genes encoding cell
cycle and mitosis-associated factors and biomarkers overexpressed in cancers and 
by increasing the expression of growth arrest-related genes. These results
reinforce the therapeutic potential of glyceollins for breast cancer.

Emerging CVD risk factors (e.g. HDL function and central haemodynamics) may
account for residual CVD risk experienced by individuals who meet LDL-cholesterol
and blood pressure (BP) targets. Recent evidence suggests that these emerging
risk factors can be modified by polyphenol-rich interventions such as soya, but
additional research is needed. This study was designed to investigate the effects
of an isoflavone-containing soya protein isolate (delivering 25 and 50 g/d soya
protein) on HDL function (i.e. ex vivo cholesterol efflux), macrovascular
function and blood markers of CVD risk. Middle-aged adults (n 20; mean age=51·6
(sem 6·6) years) with moderately elevated brachial BP (mean systolic BP=129 (sem 
9) mmHg; mean diastolic BP=82·5 (sem 8·4) mmHg) consumed 0 (control), 25 and 50
g/d soya protein in a randomised cross-over design. Soya and control powders were
consumed for 6 weeks each with a 2-week compliance break between treatment
periods. Blood samples and vascular function measures were obtained at baseline
and following each supplementation period. Supplementation with 50 g/d soya
protein significantly reduced brachial diastolic BP (-2·3 mmHg) compared with 25 
g/d soya protein (Tukey-adjusted P=0·03) but not the control. Soya
supplementation did not improve ex vivo cholesterol efflux, macrovascular
function or other blood markers of CVD risk compared with the
carbohydrate-matched control. Additional research is needed to clarify whether
effects on these CVD risk factors depend on the relative health of participants
and/or equol producing capacity.

Isoflavonoids are secondary metabolites that play a variety of roles in
plant-microbe interactions and plant defenses against abiotic stresses. Here we
report a new MYB transcription factor (TF) gene, GmMYBJ3, that is involved in the
isoflavonoids biosynthesis. The GmMYBJ3 gene is 1,002 bp long and encodes a
protein of 333 amino acids. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that GmMYBJ3 is a
typical R2R3 MYB TF. Yeast expression experiment demonstrated that GmMYBJ3 has
its transcription activity in the nucleus and is transiently expressed in onion
epidermal cells. The GmMYBJ3 gene was transformed into soybean and the expression
activity of the GmMYBJ3 gene was significantly positively correlated with total
isoflavonoid accumulation in soybean. Transient expression assays indicated that 
GmMYBJ3 can activate CHS8 expression. Furthermore, we analyzed the expressions of
several genes known involved in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis, including CHS8,
CHI1A, PAL1, IFS2 and F3H, in the GmMYBJ3 transgenic plants. The results showed
that the expression levels of CHS8 and CHI1A were significantly increased in the 
transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants, but those of PAL1, IFS2 and F3H
remained similar between the transgenic and wild-type plants. These results
suggest that GmMYBJ3 participates in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis through
regulation of CHS8 and CHI1A in soybean.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer
death in women worldwide. Nowadays, the relationship between soya diet and breast
cancer is controversial due to the unknown role of its isoflavones, genistein (G)
and daidzein (D). In this work, we investigated not only the anti-tumor
properties of a soybean extract (NBSE) but also whether the biotransformation of 
extract (BSE) by the fungus Aspergillus awamori increased its effectiveness. The 
BSE showed a stronger anti-aromatase activity and anti-proliferative efficacy in 
ER+ aromatase-overexpressing breast cancer cells. D and G were weak aromatase
inhibitors, but inhibited cancer cell growth, being G the isoflavone that
contributed to the BSE-induced effects. This work demonstrated that the
biotransformation increased the anti-aromatase activity and the anti-tumoral
efficacy of soybean extract in breast cancer cells. Moreover, it elucidated the
potential use of soya in the prevention and/or treatment of ER+ breast cancer.

Isoflavones play important roles in rhizosphere plant-microbe interactions.
Daidzein and genistein secreted by soybean roots induce the symbiotic interaction
with rhizobia and may modulate rhizosphere interactions with microbes. Yet
despite their important roles, little is known about the biosynthesis, secretion 
and fate of isoflavones in field-grown soybeans. Here, we analyzed isoflavone
contents and the expression of isoflavone biosynthesis genes in field-grown
soybeans. In roots, isoflavone contents and composition did not change with crop 
growth, but the expression of UGT4, an isoflavone-specific
7-O-glucosyltransferase, and of ICHG (isoflavone conjugates hydrolyzing
beta-glucosidase) was decreased during the reproductive stages. Isoflavone
contents were higher in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil during both vegetative
and reproductive stages, and were comparable in the rhizosphere soil between
these two stages. We analyzed the degradation dynamics of daidzein and its
glucosides to develop a model for predicting rhizosphere isoflavone contents from
the amount of isoflavones secreted in hydroponic culture. Conjugates of daidzein 
were degraded much faster than daidzein, with degradation rate constants of 8.51 
d-1 for malonyldaidzin and 11.6 d-1 for daidzin, vs. 9.15 × 10-2 d-1 for
daidzein. The model suggested that secretion of isoflavones into the rhizosphere 
is higher during vegetative stages than during reproductive stages in field-grown
soybean.

This study examines the effects induced by environmentally relevant
concentrations of the isoflavone genistein (3mg/L and 10mg/L) during early life
stages of the Senegalese sole. Throughout the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid
(HPT) axis, several neurohormonal regulatory thyroid signalling patterns
(thyroglobulin/Tg, thyroid peroxidase/TPO, transthyretin/TTR, thyroid
receptors/TRβ, and iodothrynonine deiodinases, Dio2 and Dio3) were analysed.
Furthermore, the expression patterns of estrogen receptor ERβ and haemoprotein
Cyp1a were also evaluated. In the control larvae, progressive increases of
constitutive hormonal signalling pathways have been evidenced from the
pre-metamorphosis phase onwards, reaching the highest expression basal levels at 
the metamorphosis (Tg, TPO, Dio2) and/or during post-metamorphosis (TTR, TRβ,
ERβ). When the early larvae were exposed to both genistein concentrations (3mg/L 
and 10mg/L), a statistically significant down-regulation of TPO, TTR and Tg mRNA 
levels was clearly detected at the metamorphic stages. In addition, the Dio2 and 
Dio3 transcript expression levels were also down and up-regulated when exposed to
both genistein concentrations. In the larvae exposed to genistein, no
statistically significant responses were recorded for the TRβ expression
patterns. Nevertheless, the ERβ and Cyp1a transcript levels were up-regulated at 
the middle metamorphic stage (S2, at 16 dph) in the larvae exposed to high
genistein concentrations and, only the ERβ was down-regulated (S1, at 12dph) at
the lower doses. Finally, all these pointed out imbalances were only temporarily 
disrupted by exposure to genistein, since most of the modulated transcriptional
signals (i.e. up or down-regulation) were quickly restored to the baseline
levels. Additionally, the control and genistein-exposed Senegalese sole specimens
showed characteristic ontogenetic patterns and completely suitable for an optimal
development, metamorphosis, and growth.

Flavonoids, natural products abundant in the model legume Glycine max, confer
benefits to plants and to animal health. Flavonoids are present in soybean mainly
as glycoconjugates. However, the mechanisms of biosynthesis of flavonoid
glycosides are largely unknown in G. max. In the present study, 212 putative
UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes were identified in G. max by genome-wide
searching. The GmUGT genes were distributed differentially among the 20
chromosomes, and they were expressed in various tissues with distinct expression 
profiles. We further analyzed the enzymatic activities of 11 GmUGTs that are
potentially involved in flavonoid glycosylation, and found that six of them
(UGT72X4, UGT72Z3, UGT73C20, UGT88A13, UGT88E19 and UGT92G4) exhibited activity
toward flavonol, isoflavone, flavone and flavanol aglycones with different
kinetic properties. Among them, UGT72X4, UGT72Z3 and UGT92G4 are
flavonol-specific UGTs, and UGT73C20 and UGT88E19 exhibited activity toward both 
flavonol and isoflavone aglycones. In particular, UGT88A13 exhibited activity
toward epicatechin, but not for the flavonol aglycones kaempferol and quercetin. 
Overexpression of these six GmUGT genes significantly increased the contents of
isoflavone and flavonol glucosides in soybean hairy roots. In addition,
overexpression of these six GmUGT genes also affected flavonol glycoside contents
differently in seedlings and seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. We provide
valuable information on the identification of all UGT genes in soybean, and
candidate GmUGT genes for potential metabolic engineering of flavonoid compounds 
in both Escherichia coli and plants.

In this study, the chitosan-induced coacervation of soy protein-isoflavone
complexes in soymilk was investigated. Most of the soymilk proteins, including
β-conglycinin (7S), glycinin (11S), and isoflavones, were found to coacervate
into the soymilk pellet fraction (SPF) following the addition of 0.5% chitosan.
The total protein in the soymilk supernatant fraction (SSF) decreased from 18.1 ±
0.3 mg/mL to 1.6 ± 0.1 mg/mL, and the pH values decreased slightly, from 6.6 ±
0.0 to 6.0 ± 0.0. The results of SDS-PAGE revealed that the 7S α', 7S α, 7S β,
11S A3, and 11S acidic subunits, as well as the 11S basic proteins in the SSF,
decreased to 0.7 ± 0.5%, 0.2 ± 0.1%, 0.1 ± 0.0%, 0.2 ± 0.2%, 0.2 ± 0.2% and 0.3 ±
0.2%, respectively. We also found that isoflavones in the SSF, including
daidzein, glycitein, and genistein, decreased to 9.6 ± 2.3%, 5.7 ± 0.9% and 5.9 ±
1.5%, respectively. HPLC analysis indicated that isoflavones mixed with soy
proteins formed soy protein-isoflavone complexes and were precipitated into the
SPF by 0.5% chitosan.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined germination and Alcalase 
hydrolysis on the quality of soybean protein. Protein profiles, water solubility,
foaming and emulsifying properties, thixotropic properties, and in vitro protein 
digestibility (IVPD) were tested, the chemical score (CS), essential amino acid
index (EAAI), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of soybean protein were also
defined. The combined treatment of germination and Alcalase hydrolysis remarkably
improved the solubility, emulsification activity index, emulsion stability index,
and foaming capacity of soybean protein. Notably, a decrease in foaming stability
was detected. The electrophoretic profile showed a weak breakdown of soybean
protein during germination. However, a strong breakdown of protein was observed
after the hydrolysis with Alcalase. The combined treatment also decreased the CS 
and EAAI of soybean protein, but only by 18%. Meanwhile, the IVPD and PER of
soybean protein were significantly improved. Moreover, the protein of the
germinated and hydrolyzed soybean flour demonstrated better swallowing
properties. These findings indicated that the combined treatment of germination
and enzymatic hydrolysis can improve the quality of soybean protein.

Genistein, a principal isoflavone property of soybeans, possesses multiple
pharmacological activities such as neuroprotection. Recently, it was reported
that genistein exerted antidepressant-like effects in animal models, but the
mechanism of action remains ambiguous. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the antidepressant-like effect of genistein in mice and explore the
underlying mechanism(s), using two mouse models of depression, i.e. forced swim
test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Chronic, but not acute (single dose), 
genistein treatment (5, 15 or 45&nbsp;mg/kg, p.o., once per day for three weeks)
exerted dose-dependently antidepressant-like effect in mice, concomitant with
escalated levels of brain monoamines and suppressed monoamine oxidase (MAO)
activity. Chemical depletion of brain serotonin by PCPA abrogated the
antidepressant-like action of genistein, but it was not the case for ablation of 
NA by DSP-4. Moreover, the anti-depression by genistein was preferentially
counteracted by co-administration of 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635,
suggesting a pivotal role for 5-HT system coupled with 5-HT1A receptors in
mediating such genistein anti-depression. This point was further validated by the
fact that genistein action was potentiated by co-treatment with 8-OH-DPAT, a
selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Collectively, these findings confirm that
chronic genistein administration to mice engenders antidepressant-like efficacy
evidenced by lessened behavioral despair. Serotonergic system that preferentially
couples with 5-HT1A receptors may be critically responsible for the present
genistein anti-depression.

Staphylococcal infections are often hard to treat due to increasing resistance,
especially to β-lactams. Previous studies described the synergy between common
antibiotics and isoflavonoids; however, little is yet known about the combinatory
effects of antibiotics with products of human isoflavone metabolism. In this
study, demethyltexasin (DT), a human body metabolite of soybean isoflavones, was 
evaluated for its possible antistaphylococcal combinatory effect with amoxicillin
and oxacillin. For comparison, common therapeutically used combination of
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was tested. DT showed strong synergistic interactions
against most of Staphylococcus aureus strains when combined with amoxicillin (sum
of fractional inhibitory concentrations [ΣFIC] 0.257-0.461) and oxacillin (ΣFIC
0.109-0.484). When oxacillin was combined with DT, resistance to this antibiotic 
was overcome in many cases. Moreover, antibiotic/DT combinations were effective
mainly against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); however, the commonly used
drug amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was effective only against sensitive strains.
Our results indicated DT as a compound able to act synergistically with
β-lactams. In addition, some combinations are effective against MRSA and decrease
staphylococcal resistance. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report 
of the antimicrobial synergistic effects of isoflavone human body metabolite with
common antibiotics. DT seems to be a possible candidate for further research
focused on antistaphylococcal drug development, especially against
antibiotic-resistant strains.

Determine the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids versus soybean
isoflavones in reducing the vasomotor symptoms (VMSs) frequency in postmenopausal
women. A randomized, prospective, two-arm study was performed in healthy
postmenopausal women aged 45-65. The two arms were: two capsules/day of omega-3
(425 mg of omega-3/capsule) administered orally (n = 38) and two tablets/day of
soybean isoflavones (54.4 mg of isoflavones/tablet) (n = 30), over 16 weeks. The 
mean baseline frequency of moderate and severe VMSs per week in the omega-3 group
was 24.56 and 23.90, respectively, and 19.65 and 19.51 in the isoflavone group.
After 4 months, the reduction in moderate and severe hot flashes with omega-3 was
significant (p &lt; .001), whereas in the case of isoflavones, there was a
significant difference in severe (p = .02) hot flashes after 4 months, but not in
moderate hot flashes (p = .077). Omega-3 did not demonstrate significant efficacy
differences versus isoflavones over time. The use of omega-3 has a beneficial
effect on hot flash reduction after 4 months of treatment. This is comparable to 
the benefits found with soybean isoflavones after 3-4 weeks and after 4 months in
severe hot flash women, but higher than those found with soybean isoflavones in
moderate symptom women.

Epidemiological studies have shown that dietary compounds have significant
effects on prostate carcinogenesis. Among dietary agents, genistein, the major
isoflavone in soybean, is of particular interest because high consumption of soy 
products has been associated with a low incidence of prostate cancer, suggesting 
a preventive role of genistein in prostate cancer. In spite of numerous studies
to understand the effects of genistein on prostate cancer, the mechanisms of
action have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the differences in
methylation and gene expression levels of prostate specimens from a clinical
trial of genistein supplementation prior to prostatectomy using Illumina
HumanMethylation450 and Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Microarrays.
The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical
trial on Norwegian patients who received 30&nbsp;mg genistein or placebo capsules
daily for 3-6 weeks before prostatectomy. Gene expression changes were validated 
by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Whole genome methylation and expression profiling
identified differentially methylated sites and expressed genes between placebo
and genistein groups. Differentially regulated genes were involved in
developmental processes, stem cell markers, proliferation and transcriptional
regulation. Enrichment analysis suggested overall reduction in MYC activity and
increased PTEN activity in genistein-treated patients. These findings highlight
the effects of genistein on global changes in gene expression in prostate cancer 
and its effects on molecular pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis.

Malonylated isoflavones are the major forms of isoflavonoids in soybean plants,
the genes responsible for their biosyntheses are not well understood, nor their
physiological functions. Here we report a new benzylalcohol O-acetyltransferase, 
anthocyanin O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, anthranilate
N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase, deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase
(BAHD) family isoflavone glucoside malonyltransferase GmIMaT1, and GmIMaT3, which
is allelic to the previously characterized GmMT7 and GmIF7MaT. Biochemical
studies showed that recombinant GmIMaT1 and GmIMaT3 enzymes used malonyl-CoA and 
several isoflavone 7-O-glucosides as substrates. The Km values of GmIMaT1 for
glycitin, genistin, and daidzin were 13.11, 23.04, and 36.28 μM, respectively,
while these of GmIMaT3 were 12.94, 26.67, and 30.12 μM, respectively. Transgenic 
hairy roots overexpressing both GmIMaTs had increased levels of malonyldaidzin
and malonylgenistin, and contents of daidzin and glycitin increased only in
GmIMaT1-overexpression lines. The increased daidzein and genistein contents were 
detected only in GmIMaT3-overexpression lines. Knockdown of GmIMaT1 and GmIMaT3
reduced malonyldaidzin and malonylgenistin contents, and affected other
isoflavonoids differently. GmIMaT1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic
reticulum while GmIMaT3 is primarily in the cytosol. By examining their
transcript changes corresponding to the altered isoflavone metabolic profiles
under various environmental and hormonal stresses, we probed the possible
functions of GmIMaTs. Two GmIMaTs displayed distinct tissue expression patterns
and respond differently to various factors in modifying isoflavone 7-O-glucosides
under various stresses.

Yak-Kong (YK) (Glycine max), a small black soybean cultivar with a green embryo, 
was evaluated for functional constituents with a focus on atherosclerosis
prevention. In comparison to common yellow and black soybean cultivars, YK
contains significantly higher concentrations of antioxidants, particularly in its
seed coat. A comprehensive phenolic composition analysis revealed that
proanthocyanidins were the major phenolic group in YK. In contrast to other
proanthocyanidin-rich foods, YK was rich in bioavailable proanthocyanidins (with 
a degree of polymerization ≤3) specifically with A-type dimers. Significant
concentrations of phloridzin and coumestrol were also exclusively found in YK
seed coat and the embryo, respectively. Extracts of both the
proanthocyanidin-rich seed coat and isoflavonoid-rich embryo of YK attenuated
adhesion of THP-1 to LPS-stimulated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells,
suggesting that they are important sources of coronary heart disease-preventive
phenolics. YK has promising potential for further development as a functional
food source targeted at atherosclerosis prevention.

Although it is well known that solar ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation enhances
plant defenses, there is less knowledge about traits that define insect
resistance in field-grown soybean. Here we study the effects of solar UV-B
radiation on: a) the induction of phenolic compounds and trypsin proteinase
inhibitors (TPI) in soybean undamaged leaves or damaged by Anticarsia gemmatalis 
neonates during six days, and b) the survival and mass gain of A.&nbsp;gemmatalis
larvae that fed on soybean foliage. Two soybean cultivars (cv.), Charata and
Williams, were grown under plastic with different transmittance to solar UV-B
radiation, which generated two treatments: ambient UV-B (UVB+) and reduced UV-B
(UVB-) radiation. Solar UV-B radiation decreased survivorship by 30% and mass
gain by 45% of larvae that fed on cv. Charata, but no effect was found in those
larvae that fed on cv. Williams. TPI activity and malonyl genistin were induced
by A.&nbsp;gemmatalis damage in both cultivars, but solar UV-B radiation and damage
only synergistically increased the induction of these compounds in cv. Williams. 
Although TPI activity and genistein derivatives were induced by herbivory, these 
results did not explain the differences found in survivorship and mass gain of
larvae that fed on cv. Charata. However, we found a positive association between 
lower larval performance and the presence of two quercetin triglycosides and a
kaempferol triglycoside in foliage of cv. Charata, which were identified by
HPLC-DAD/MS2. We conclude that exclusion of solar UV-B radiation reduce
resistance to A.&nbsp;gemmatalis, due to a reduction in flavonol concentration in a
cultivar that has low levels of genistein derivatives like cv. Charata.

Structure and dissociation properties of soybean protein isolate (SPI) induced by
ultrasound and acid were investigated. Results of solubility showed that
ultrasound-assisted acid had no effect on the content of soluble aggregates in
SPI. Increase of fluorescence intensity and red-shift of maximum emission
wavelength indicated that acid induced molecular unfolding of SPI and exposure of
hydrophobic groups. Circular dichroism spectra showed that ultrasound-assisted
acid pretreatment resulted in increases in the α-helix content by 29.2% and
random coils content by 8.3%, while β-sheet decreased by 13.4% (P&lt;0.05), as
compared with those of control. Analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscope revealed that the contents of
small subunits and particle increased significantly when SPI treated by
ultrasound-assisted acid comparing with the SPI treated by single acid and
ultrasound treatment. This study illustrated the ultrasound and acid have
synergistic effect on the structure unfolding and dissociation of SPI.

Isoflavones comprise a group of secondary metabolites produced almost exclusively
by plants in the legume family, including soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. They 
play vital roles in plant defense and have many beneficial effects on human
health. Isoflavone content is a complex quantitative trait controlled by multiple
genes, and the genetic mechanisms underlying isoflavone biosynthesis remain
largely unknown. Via a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified 28
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with
isoflavone concentrations in soybean. One of these 28 SNPs was located in the
5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of an R2R3-type MYB transcription factor,
GmMYB29, and this gene was thus selected as a candidate gene for further
analyses. A subcellular localization study confirmed that GmMYB29 was located in 
the nucleus. Transient reporter gene assays demonstrated that GmMYB29 activated
the IFS2 (isoflavone synthase 2) and CHS8 (chalcone synthase 8) gene promoters.
Overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing of GmMYB29 in soybean hairy roots
resulted in increased and decreased isoflavone content, respectively. Moreover, a
candidate-gene association analysis revealed that 11 natural GmMYB29
polymorphisms were significantly associated with isoflavone contents, and
regulation of GmMYB29 expression could partially contribute to the observed
phenotypic variation. Taken together, these results provide important genetic
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying isoflavone biosynthesis in
soybean.

In the pursuit of sustainable agriculture through environment and human health
friendly practices, we evaluated the potential of a novel gibberellins (GAs)
producing basidiomycetous endophytic fungus Porostereum spadiceum AGH786, for
alleviating salt stress and promoting health benefits of soybean. Soybean
seedlings exposed to different levels of NaCl stress (70 and 140 mM) under
greenhouse conditions, were inoculated with the AGH786 strain. Levels of
phytohormones including GAs, JA and ABA, and isoflavones were compared in control
and the inoculated seedlings to understand the mechanism through which the stress
is alleviated. Gibberellins producing endophytic fungi have been vital for
promoting plant growth under normal and stress conditions. We report P. spadiceum
AGH786 as the ever first GAs producing basidiomycetous fungus capable of
producing six types of GAs. In comparison to the so for most efficient GAs
producing Gibberella fujikuroi, AGH786 produced significantly higher amount of
the bioactive GA3. Salt-stressed phenotype of soybean seedlings was characterized
by low content of GAs and high amount of ABA and JA with reduced shoot length,
biomass, leaf area, chlorophyll contents, and rate of photosynthesis. Mitigation 
of salt stress by AGH786 was always accompanied by high GAs, and low ABA and JA, 
suggesting that this endophytic fungus reduces the effect of salinity by
modulating endogenous phytohormones of the seedlings. Additionally, this strain
also enhanced the endogenous level of two isoflavones including daidzen and
genistein in soybean seedlings under normal as well as salt stress conditions as 
compared to their respective controls. P. spadiceum AGH786 boosted the NaCl
stress tolerance and growth in soybean, by modulating seedlings endogenous
phytohormones and isoflavones suggesting a valuable contribution of this potent
fungal biofertilizer in sustainable agriculture in salt affected soils.

Owing to the presence of nutritionally important, health-promoting bioactive
compounds, especially isoflavones, soybean has acquired the status of a
functional food. miRNAs are tiny riboregulator of gene expression by either
decreasing and/or increasing the expression of their corresponding target genes. 
Despite several works on identification and functional characterization of plant 
miRNAs, the role of miRNAs in the regulation of isoflavones metabolism is still a
virgin field. In the present study, we identified a total of 31 new miRNAs along 
with their 245 putative target genes from soybean seed-specific ESTs using
computational approach. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
analyses indicated that miRNA putatively regulates metabolism and genetic
information processing. Out of that, a total of 5 miRNAs (Gma-miRNA12,
Gma-miRNA24, Gma-miRNA26, Gma-miRNA28, and Gma-miRNA29) were predicted and
validated for their probable role during isoflavone biosynthesis. We also
validated their five target genes using RA-PCR, which is as good as 5'RLM-RACE.
Temporal regulation [35 days after flowering, 45, 55, and 65 DAF] of miRNAs and
their targets showed differential expression schema. Differential expression of
Gma-miR26 and Gma-miRNA28 along with their corresponding target genes
(Glyma.10G197900 and Glyma.09G127200) showed a direct relationship with the total
isoflavone content. Therefore, understanding the miRNA-based genetic regulation
of isoflavone pathway would assist in selection and manipulation to get
high-performing soybean genotypes with better isoflavone yield.

In the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated Cardiovascular Disease and
Alimentary Comparison Study, isoflavones (I; biomarker for dietary soy) and
taurine (T; biomarker for dietary fish) in 24-hour-urine (24U) were inversely
related to coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. High levels of these
biomarkers are found in Japanese people, whose CHD mortality is lowest among
developed countries. We analyzed the association of these biomarkers with
cardiovascular disease risk in the Japanese to know their health effects within
one ethnic population. First, to compare the Japanese intake of I and T with
international intakes, the ratios of 24UI and 24UT to creatinine from the WHO
Study were divided into quintiles for analysis. The ratio for the Japanese was
the highest in the highest quintiles for both I and T, reaching 88.1%, far higher
than the average ratio for the Japanese (26.3%) in the total study population.
Second, 553 inhabitants of Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, aged 30 to 79 years underwent
24-U collection and blood analyses. The 24UT and 24UI were divided into tertiles 
and adjusted for age and sex. The highest T tertile, compared with the lowest
tertile, showed significantly higher levels of high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, 24U sodium (Na) and potassium
(K). The highest I tertile showed significantly higher folate, 24UNa and 24UK
compared with the lowest tertile. The highest tertile of both T and I showed
significantly higher HDL-C, folate, and 24UNa and 24UK compared with the lowest
tertile. Thus, greater consumption of fish and soy were significantly associated 
with higher HDL-C and folate levels, possibly a contributor to Japan having the
lowest CHD mortality and longest life expectancy among developed countries. As
these intakes were also associated with a high intake of salt, a low-salt intake 
of fish and soy should be recommended for healthy life expectancy.

Soybean is rich in protein/vegetable oil and contains several phytochemicals such
as isoflavones and phenolic compounds. Because of the predominated nutritional
values, soybean is considered as traditional health benefit food. Soybean is a
widely cultivated crop; however, its growth and yield are markedly affected by
adverse environmental conditions. Proteomic techniques make it feasible to map
protein profiles both during soybean growth and under unfavorable conditions. The
stress-responsive mechanisms during soybean growth have been uncovered with the
help of proteomic studies. In this review, the history of soybean as food and the
morphology/physiology of soybean are described. The utilization of proteomics
during soybean germination and development is summarized. In addition, the
stress-responsive mechanisms explored using proteomic techniques are reviewed in 
soybean.

Pterocarpan forms the basic structure of leguminous phytoalexins, and most of the
isoflavonoid pathway genes encoding the enzymes responsible for its biosynthesis 
have been identified. However, the last step of pterocarpan biosynthesis is a
ring closure reaction, and the enzyme that catalyzes this step,
2'-hydroxyisoflavanol 4,2'-dehydratase or pterocarpan synthase (PTS), remains as 
an unidentified 'missing link'. This last ring formation is assumed to be the key
step in determining the stereochemistry of pterocarpans, which plays a role in
their antimicrobial activity. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding PTS from
Glycyrrhiza echinata (GePTS1) was identified through functional expression
fractionation screening of a cDNA library, which requires no sequence
information, and orthologs from soybean (GmPTS1) and Lotus japonicus (LjPTS1)
were also identified. These proteins were heterologously expressed in Escherichia
coli and biochemically characterized. Surprisingly, the proteins were found to
include amino acid motifs characteristic of dirigent proteins, some of which
control stereospecific phenoxy radical coupling in lignan biosynthesis. The
stereospecificity of substrates and products was examined using four substrate
stereoisomers with hydroxy and methoxy derivatives at C-4'. The results showed
that the 4R configuration was essential for the PTS reaction, and (-)- and
(+)-pterocarpans were produced depending on the stereochemistry at C-3. In
suspension-cultured soybean cells, levels of the GmPTS1 transcript increased
temporarily prior to the peak in phytoalexin accumulation, strongly supporting
the possible involvement of PTS in pterocarpan biosynthesis.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soy
isoflavone on tibia length, bone mineral density (BMD), and structural parameters
in growing female rats.
METHODS: Three-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four
experimental groups: control (CON: distilled water gavage); low-dose isoflavone
(low-IF: 10&nbsp;mg/kg body weight [BW]/d gavage); high-dose isoflavone (high-IF:
50&nbsp;mg/kg BW/d gavage); and 17 β-estradiol (E2: subcutaneous injection of 10&nbsp;μg). 
All animals received a soy-free diet and vaginal opening was monitored daily.
After an 8-wk treatment period, bone-related parameters (alkaline phosphatase
[ALP], osteocalcin [OC], N-terminal telopeptide [NTx], bone length, failure load,
stiffness, BMD, and structural parameters) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Serum ALP levels of the high-IF group were higher than those of the CON 
group (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05); however, serum OC levels of the high-IF group were lower than
those of the CON, low-IF, and E2 groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). The tibias and femurs of the 
low-IF group were longer than those of the CON and high-IF groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05).
Bone volume, trabecular number, and BMD of trabecular bone of the high-IF and E2 
groups were higher than those of the CON and low-IF groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). The
trabecular thickness of the high-IF group was higher than that of the CON and
low-IF groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). The failure load of the high-IF group was higher than
those of the CON group (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). Age and body weight at vaginal opening of the 
E2 group were significantly lower than those of the CON, low-IF, and high-IF
groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 8&nbsp;wk of low-dose supplementation with soy
isoflavone stimulates longitudinal bone growth. Additionally, high-dose
supplementation with soy isoflavone may improve bone quality (BMD and structural 
parameters) in growing female rats.

OBJECTIVE: To verify the efficacy of phytoestrogen supplementation combined with 
aerobic and resistance training on the improvement of climacteric symptoms and
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: From a pool of women who had participated in a 1-year intervention study
and were randomly assigned to either exercise + phytoestrogen (EX + PHY) or
exercise + placebo (EX + PL), a total of 31 healthy but overweight women (mean
age 59.2 ± 4.8 years, body mass index 29.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2) finished the study
(EX + PHY, n = 15; EX + PL, n = 16). All the following variables were measured
before, after 6 months and after 12 months of intervention: body composition (fat
and lean body mass, DXA), HRQoL (SF-36 questionnaire: physical and mental
component summaries and subscales; and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale
questionnaire), climacteric symptoms (Kupperman Index questionnaire).
RESULTS: After 1 year of intervention, physical functioning (p = 0.003),
role-emotional (p = 0.031), vitality (p = 0.007), and global health (p &lt; 0.001)
were significantly and similarly increased in both groups. Regarding climacteric 
symptoms, an improvement in the Kupperman index total score (p = 0.015) was
observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that adding phytoestrogens to exercise
training does not provide the additive effect for HRQoL in postmenopausal and
overweight women. Moreover, exercise and phytoestrogen may interfere in the
improvement of climacteric symptoms in the long term.

The hypocholesterolemic effect of soy is well-documented and this has led to the 
regulatory approval of a health claim relating soy protein to a reduced risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, soybeans contain additional components,
such as isoflavones, lecithins, saponins and fiber that may improve
cardiovascular health through independent mechanisms. This review summarizes the 
evidence on the cardiovascular benefits of non-protein soy components in relation
to known CVD risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, inflammation, and 
obesity beyond cholesterol lowering. Overall, the available evidence suggests
non-protein soy constituents improve markers of cardiovascular health; however,
additional carefully designed studies are required to independently elucidate
these effects. Further, work is also needed to clarify the role of
isoflavone-metabolizing phenotype and gut microbiota composition on biological
effect.

Soy-food and its isoflavones, genistein (G) and daidzein (D), were reported to
exert mild cholesterol-lowering effect, but the underlying mechanism is still
unclear. In this research, first we studied age-related alterations in hepatic
cholesterol metabolism of acyclic middle-aged (MA) female rats. Then we tested if
purified isoflavones may prevent or reverse these changes, and whether putative
changes in hepatic thyroid hormone availability may be associated with this
effect. Serum and hepatic total cholesterol (TChol), bile acid and cholesterol
precursors, as well as serum TSH and T4 concentrations, hepatic deiodinase (Dio) 
1 enzyme activity and MCT8 protein expression were determined by comparing data
obtained for MA with young adult (YA) intact (IC) females. Effects of
subcutaneously administered G or D (35mg/kg) to MA rats were evaluated versus
vehicle-treated MA females. MA IC females were characterized by: higher (p&lt;0.05) 
serum TChol, lower (p&lt;0.05) hepatic TChol and its biosynthetic precursors, lower 
(p&lt;0.05) hepatic 7α-hydroxycholesterol but elevated (p&lt;0.05) 27- and
24-hydroxycholesterol in comparison to YA IC. Both isoflavone treatments
decreased (p&lt;0.05) hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol, G being more effective than D, 
without affecting any other parameter of Chol metabolism. Only G elevated hepatic
Dio1 activity (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, age-related hypercholesteremia was
associated with lower hepatic Chol synthesis and shift from main neutral (lower
7α-hydroxycholesterol) to alternative acidic pathway (higher
27-hydroxycholesterol) of Chol degradation to bile acid. Both isoflavones lowered
hepatic 27-hydroxycholesterol, which may be considered beneficial. Only G
treatment increased hepatic Dio1 activity, thus indicating local increase in
thyroid hormones, obviously insufficient to induce prominent cholesterol-lowering
effect.

Soybean-derived isoflavones have been investigated for their preventative effects
against UV-induced symptoms of skin damage including wrinkle formation and
inflammation. Haematococcus pluvialis is a freshwater species of Chlorophyta that
contains high concentrations of the natural carotenoid pigment astaxanthin.
Astaxanthin is known to be involved in retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling and
previously been associated with the inhibition of activator protein (AP)-1
dependent transcription. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that a
combination of soy extract (SE) and Haematococcus extract (HE) may prevent
UVB-induced photoaging through specific signaling pathways, as measured by
UVB-induced wrinkling on hairless mice skin and expression changes in human
dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The 1:2 ratio of SE and HE mixture (SHM) showed the
optimal benefit in vivo. SHM was found to inhibit wrinkle formation via the
downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 mRNA and protein expression.
SHM also inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and
the transactivation of AP-1 which plays an important role in regulating MMP
expression. These results highlight the potential for SHM to be developed as a
therapeutic agent to prevent UVB-induced skin wrinkling.

PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of soy proteins with depletion of
different subunits of the two major storage proteins, β-conglycinin and glycinin,
on hepatic lipids and proteins involved in lipid metabolism in rats, since the
bioactive component of soy responsible for lipid-lowering is unclear.
METHODS: Weanling Sprague Dawley rats were fed diets containing either 20% casein
protein in the absence (casein) or presence (casein + ISF) of isoflavones or 20% 
alcohol-washed soy protein isolate (SPI) or 20% soy protein concentrates derived 
from a conventional (Haro) or 2 soybean lines lacking the α' subunit of
β-conglycinin and the A1-3 (1TF) or A1-5 (1a) subunits of glycinin. After 8
weeks, the rats were necropsied and liver proteins and lipids were extracted and 
analysed.
RESULTS: The results showed that soy protein diets reduced lipid droplet
accumulation and content in the liver compared to casein diets. The soy protein
diets also decreased the level of hepatic mature SREBP-1 and FAS in males, with
significant decreases in diets 1TF and 1a compared to the casein diets. The
effect of the soy protein diets on female hepatic mature SREBP-1, FAS, and HMGCR 
was confounded since casein + ISF decreased these levels compared to casein alone
perhaps muting the decrease by soy protein. A reduction in both phosphorylated
and total STAT3 in female livers by ISF may account for the gender difference in 
mechanism in the regulation and protein expression of the lipid modulators.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, soy protein deficient in the α' subunit of β-conglycinin
and A1-5 subunits of glycinin maintain similar hypolipidemic function compared to
the conventional soy protein. The exact bioactive component(s) warrant
identification.

Genistein is one of the most abundant isoflavones in soybean. This molecule
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in different normal and cancer cells.
Genistein has been of considerable interest due to its adverse effects on bovine 
reproduction, altering estrous cycle, implantation and fetal development and
producing subfertility or infertility. The objective of this work was to study
the effects of genistein on the expression of selected genes involved in the
regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Primary cultures of bovine oviductal
epithelial cells (BOEC) were treated with different genistein concentrations
(0.2, 2 and 10μM) to analyze CYCLIN B1, BCL-2 and BAX gene expression by
Real-time RT-PCR. Results showed that genistein down-regulated CYCLIN B1
expression, affecting cell cycle progression, and caused a decrease in the
BCL-2/BAX ratio starting at 2μM of genistein. In addition, in order to determine 
if genistein affects BOEC migration, in vitro wound healing assays were
performed. A significant reduction in cell migration after 12h of culture was
observed at both 0.2 and 10μM genistein concentrations. Also, in the presence of 
genistein the percentage of mitotic cells decreased, although apoptotic cells
percentages were not affected. These findings indicate that genistein has an
inhibitory effect on BOEC proliferation and migration, suggesting that it could
influence the normal physiology of the oviductal epithelium.

Phosphorus (P) intake, genotype, and growth environment in soybean cultivation
can affect the composition of the soybean. This experiment was conducted in two
locations (microregions I and II) using a randomized complete block design,
including conventional soybean (BRS Sambaíba) and genetically modified (GM) [Msoy
9144 Roundup Ready (RR)] cultivars and varying doses of phosphorus fertilizer (0,
60, 120, and 240 kg/ha P2O5). Soybeans were evaluated for chemical composition,
total phenols, phytic acid content, individual isoflavone content, antioxidant
activity, oil quality, fatty acid profile, total carotenoid content, and
individual tocopherol contents. Multivariate analysis facilitated reduction in
the number of variables with respect to soybean genotype (conventional BRS
Sambaíba and GM Msoy 9144 RR), dose of P2O5 fertilizer, and place of cultivation 
(microregion I and II). BRS Sambaíba had higher concentrations of β-glucosides,
malonylglucosides, glycitein, and genistein than Msoy 9144 RR, which showed a
higher concentration of daidzein. The highest concentrations of isoflavones and
fatty acids were observed in soybeans treated with 120 and 240 kg/ha P2O5,
regardless of the location and cultivar.

BACKGROUND: While current therapies for osteoporosis focus on reducing bone
resorption, the development of therapies to regenerate bone may also be
beneficial. Promising anabolic therapy candidates include phytoestrogens, such as
daidzein, which effectively induce osteogenesis of adipose-derived stromal cells 
(ASCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).
PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of glyceollins, structural derivatives of
daidzein, on osteogenesis of ASCs and BMSCs.
STUDY DESIGN: Herein, the osteoinductive effects of glyceollin I and glyceollin
II were assessed and compared to estradiol in ASCs and BMSCs. The mechanism by
which glyceollin II induces osteogenesis was further examined.
METHODS: The ability of glyceollins to promote osteogenesis of ASCs and BMSCs was
evaluated in adherent and scaffold cultures. Relative deposition of calcium was
analyzed using Alizarin Red staining, Bichinchoninic acid Protein Assay, and
Alamar Blue Assay. To further explore the mechanism by which glyceollin II exerts
its osteoinductive effects, docking studies of glyceollin II, RNA isolation, cDNA
synthesis, and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) were performed.
RESULTS: In adherent cultures, ASCs and BMSCs treated with estradiol, glyceollin 
I, or glyceollin II demonstrated increased calcium deposition relative to
vehicle-treated cells. During evaluation on PLGA scaffolds seeded with ASCs and
BMSCs, glyceollin II was the most efficacious in inducing ASC and BMSC
osteogenesis compared to estradiol and glyceollin I. Dose-response analysis in
ASCs and BMSCs revealed that glyceollin II has the highest potency at 10nM in
adherent cultures and 1µM in tissue scaffold cultures. At all doses,
osteoinductive effects were attenuated by fulvestrant, suggesting that glyceollin
II acts at least in part through estrogen receptor-mediated pathways to induce
osteogenesis. Analysis of gene expression demonstrated that, similar to
estradiol, glyceollin II induces upregulation of genes involved in osteogenic
differentiation.
CONCLUSION: The ability of glyceollin II to induce osteogenic differentiation in 
ASCs and BMSCs indicates that glyceollins hold the potential for the development 
of pharmacological interventions to improve clinical outcomes of patients with
osteoporosis.

The search for anticancer MMP-9 inhibitors (MMPIs) in food products has become a 
major goal for research. MMPIs in soy have been related only to saponins and
isoflavones, but recently, low specific protein fractions in soybeans were shown 
to reduce MMP-9 activity as well. The present work aimed at comparing the MMPI
potential of protein fractions (P) and non-protein fractions (NP) isolated from
soybean seeds, before and after soaking and cooking, mimicking dietary exposures.
Reverse and substrate zymography, as well as a fluoregenic DQ gelatin assay were 
used to evaluate MMP-9 activities. Colon cancer cell migration and proliferation 
was also tested in HT29 cells. Regarding MMP-9 inhibition, proteins in soy
presented IC50 values 100 times lower than non-protein extracts, and remained
active after cooking, suggesting that proteins may be more effective MMP-9
inhibitors than non-protein compounds. Using the determined IC50 concentrations, 
NP fractions were able to induce higher inhibitions of HT29 cell migration and
proliferation, but not through MMP-9 inhibition, whilst protein fractions were
shown to specifically inhibit MMP-9 activity. Overall, our results show that
protein fractions in soybeans might have a higher role in soy-related cancer
prevention as MMPIs than previously expected. Being nontoxic and active at lower 
concentrations, the discovery of these heat-resistant specific MMPI proteins in
soy can be of significant importance for cancer preventive diets, particularly
considering the increasing use of soy proteins in food products and the
controversy around isoflavones amongst consumers.

The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Obesity increases the risk for
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through adipokine dysregulation and
inflammation. Previously, we have reported that a high-isoflavone soy protein
isolate (HISPI) diet is associated with significantly heavier body weights and
reduced liver steatosis in obese Zucker rats (OZR) compared to a casein diet. The
objective of this study was to investigate whether daidzein, a soy isoflavone in 
HISPI, is responsible for increased body weight gain or reduced liver steatosis. 
We hypothesized that a casein diet containing high daidzein (HD) compared to low 
daidzein (LD) would mitigate hepatic steatosis in female OZR. We used 19
five-week-old female OZR (fa/fa). Rats were randomly assigned to a modified
AIN-93G diet containing HD (0.121 g kg-1 feed) or LD (0.01 g kg-1 feed). Rats
were weighed twice weekly. Feed intake was measured once weekly, and kcal per kg 
of body weight was calculated. After 8 weeks, rats were sacrificed. Serum and
livers were collected. Sections of the liver lobe were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Steatosis was semiquantitated as
a score of 1 to 4 based upon the relative degree of steatosis within hepatocytes:
(1) &lt;25%, (2) 25%-50%, (3) 50%-75%, and (4) &gt;75%. Serum leptin and adiponectin
were measured by ELISA. Our results did not show significant differences in mean 
liver steatosis scores, body weights, energy intake, and serum leptin and
adiponectin levels between diet groups. In conclusion, daidzein may not be the
main component of HISPI responsible for increasing body weight or reducing liver 
steatosis in OZR.

In order to improve the poor water solubility of genistein
(4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), which is extracted from food sources such as tofu,
soybeans, and kudzu, we sulfonated genistein to synthesize a relatively more
water-soluble compound, namely genistein-3'-sodium sulfonate (GSS). Our previous 
studies demonstrate that GSS protects cortical neurons from injury induced by
focal cerebral ischemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this
protective effect remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the protective effect
and potential molecular mechanisms of action of GSS in rat glutamate-induced
cortical neuron injury in vitro and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in
vivo models. Our results showed that GSS exhibited a protective effect against
glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in rat cortical neurons by reducing lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release, inhibiting cell apoptosis, increasing Bcl-2/Bax
expression ratio, and reducing Caspase 3 activity. GSS also decreased the
infarcted area and neurological deficits in the rat MCAO model, reduced LDH
release from the brain tissue to the serum, increased the Bcl-2/Bax expression
ratio, and reduced Caspase 3 activity. These findings suggest that GSS protects
rat cortical neurons from injury induced by focal cerebral ischemia in both in
vitro and in vivo models, through increased Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio and
reduced Caspase 3 activity.

AIMS: Substantial studies have reported that maternal protein restriction may
induce later development of cardiovascular disease in offspring by impairing
antioxidant system and lipid metabolism. Because a unique amino acid composition 
of soy protein isolate has been shown to provide health benefits, including
hypolipidemic effects, we investigated effects of maternal low-protein diet
composed of low-isoflavone soy protein isolate (SPI) on oxidative stress and
lipid metabolism in offspring.
MAIN METHODS: Sprague-Dawley dams were fed 20% or 10% SPI diet throughout
pregnancy and lactation. On postnatal day 21, male offspring and their dams were 
studied.
KEY FINDINGS: Maternal consumption of low-protein diet composed of SPI did not
induce hepatic oxidative stress in offspring. Although serum triacylglycerol and 
cholesterol levels in dams were not different between groups, serum
triacylglycerol levels were lower in offspring of dams fed a 10% SPI diet (10%
SPI group) compared to offspring of dams fed a 20% SPI diet (20% SPI group).
Maternal protein restriction also reduced serum HDL/total cholesterol levels. The
mRNA levels of apolipoprotein A1, which is required for HDL formation, were lower
in 10% SPI group compared to 20% SPI group and were positively correlated with
serum HDL-cholesterol levels.
SIGNIFICANCE: Although maternal consumption of low-protein diet containing SPI
did not induce oxidative stress and hypertriglyceridemia, the present study
indicates that it may disturb cholesterol metabolism of rat offspring on
postnatal day 21. Further studies are warranted to investigate the effect of
maternal diet composed of soy protein isolate on later development of
cardiovascular disease in offspring.

The isoflavone profiles of seeds of various soybean genotypes with different
levels of shade tolerance at the seedling stage were investigated.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify 12
isoflavones, and the data were analyzed using a multivariate statistical
analysis. Combined with field experimental data and an orthogonal partial
least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), several aglycones (genistein (GE),
daidzein (DE), and glycitein (GLE)) were selected and identified as key compounds
involved in the shade tolerance of soybean seedlings. Additional correlation
analysis and laboratory shading stress experiments with soybean seedlings also
confirmed the function of these selected isoflavones, especially GE, in the
discrimination of soybean seedlings with different levels of shade tolerance.
Furthermore, the structure-antioxidant activity relationships between a range of 
isoflavones and the plant shade-tolerance mechanism are discussed. Targeted
metabolomic analyses of isoflavones could reveal the diversity of shade tolerance
in soybean seedlings, thus contributing to the breeding of excellent soybean
varieties.

The effectiveness for vasomotor symptoms and sleep disorders plus the long-term
safety of a nutraceutical combination of agnus-castus and magnolia extracts
combined with soy isoflavones (SI) and lactobacilli were assessed in
postmenopausal women. A controlled study was carried out in menopausal women
comparing this nutraceutical combination (ESP group) with a formulation
containing isoflavones alone (C group) at the dosage recommended. The Kuppermann 
index, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Short Form 36 (SF-36) were 
determined at baseline, three, six and 12 months. Endometrial thickness, mammary 
density and liver function were evaluated at baseline and after 12 months. One
hundred and eighty women were enrolled in the study (100 in the ESP group and 80 
in the C group). At the end of the treatment, mammary density, endometrial
thickness, and hepatic function did not show substantial differences between
groups. The Kuppermann index and particularly the tendency for hot flashes
progressively and significantly decreased in frequency and severity during ESP
versus C treatment. At the same time, a significant increase in sleep quality and
psychophysical wellness parameters was observed in the ESP versus C groups. No
adverse events were observed. Agnus-castus and magnolia, combined with SI +
lactobacilli, can effectively and safely be used in symptomatic postmenopausal
women, mainly when quality of sleep is the most disturbing complaint. The
endometrium, mammary glands and liver function were unaffected after 12 months of
treatment.

C-glycosyltransferases (CGTs) are important enzymes that are responsible for the 
synthesis of the C-glycosides of flavonoids and isoflavonoids. Flavonoid CGTs
have been molecularly characterized from several plant species; however, to date,
no gene encoding an isoflavonoid CGT has been reported from any plant species. A 
significant example of an isoflavonoid C-glycoside is puerarin, a compound that
contributes to the major medicinal effects of Pueraria lobata. Little is known
about the C-glucosylation that occurs during puerarin biosynthesis. One possible 
route for puerarin synthesis is via the C-glucosylation of daidzein. This study
describes the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel
glucosyltransferase (PlUGT43) from P.&nbsp;lobata. Biochemical analyses revealed that 
PlUGT43 possesses an activity for the C-glucosylation of daidzein to puerarin; it
shows activity with the isoflavones daidzein and genistein, but displays no
activity towards other potential acceptors, including flavonoids. To validate the
in&nbsp;vivo function of PlUGT43, the PlUGT43 gene was over-expressed in soybean hairy
roots that naturally synthesize daidzein but that do not produce puerarin. The
expression of PlUGT43 led to the production of puerarin in the transgenic soybean
hairy roots, confirming a role for PlUGT43 in puerarin biosynthesis.

Soybeans, produced by Glycine max (L.) Merr., contain high levels of isoflavones,
such as genistein and daidzein. However, soy leaves contain more diverse and
abundant flavonol glycosides and coumestans, as compared to the soybean. This
study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of the major coumestans present 
in soy leaf (coumestrol, isotrifoliol, and phaseol) in lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. Coumestans significantly reduced LPS-induced nitric
oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production; isotrifoliol had the most potent anti-inflammatory activity.
Isotrifoliol reduced LPS-mediated induction of mRNA expression of inducible
nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin (IL)-1β,
IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and chemokines, such as chemokine (C-C 
motif) ligand (CCL) 2, CCL3, and CCL4. Isotrifoliol prevented NF-κB p65 subunit
activation by reducing the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of
NF-κB. And isotrifoliol significantly suppressed phosphorylation of the
extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, isotrifoliol suppressed
LPS-induced Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, including mRNA expression
of TNF receptor associated factor 6, transforming growth factor beta-activated
kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2), and TAB3. These results
demonstrate that isotrifoliol exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing
the expression of inflammatory mediators via inhibition of TLR/NF-κB and TLR/MAPK
signaling in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. Therefore, isotrifoliol can be
used as an anti-inflammatory agent, and coumestan-rich soy leaf extracts may
provide a useful dietary supplement.

Soybean hulls or seed coats consist of complex carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,
and polyphenols such as anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, and isoflavones. The
polyphenolics in the seed coats give them various colors such as black, brown,
green, yellow, or even a mottled appearance. In this study, the antimicrobial
effects of phenolic extracts from the seed coats of different colored soybeans
(yellow, dark brown, brown, and black) were evaluated against foodborne pathogens
such as Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Campylobacter
jejuni in broth-cultures as well as on chicken skin. The highest total phenolic
content was observed for the phenolic extract from soybean variety (R07-1927)
with black colored seed coat (74.1 ± 2.1 mg chlorogenic acid equivalent [CAE]/g
extract) and was significantly different (P &lt;0.0001) from the extract of the
conventional soybean variety (R08-4004) with yellow colored seed coat (7.4 ± 1.2 
mg CAE/g extract). The extract from black colored soybean produced reductions of 
2.10 ± 0.08 to 2.20 ± 0.08-log CFU/mL for both E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni
after 3 d when incubated in broth-culture having 4-log CFU/mL of bacteria,
whereas a 6 d incubation was found to reduce S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7
at 2.03 ± 0.05 and 3.3 ± 0.08-log CFU/mL, respectively. The extract also reduced 
S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 attached to chicken skin by 1.39 ± 0.03 and
1.24 ± 0.06-log CFU/g, respectively, upon incubation for 6 d. Soybean seed coat
extracts may have a potency as antimicrobial agents to reduce foodborne bacteria 
contaminating poultry products.

Field experiments were conducted over 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2015), in which
half of the young stage soybean plants were exposed to volatiles from cut
goldenrods three times over 2-3 weeks, while the other half remained unexposed.
There was a significant reduction in the level of the total leaf damage on
exposed soybean plants compared with unexposed ones. In 2015, the proportion of
damage to plants by Spodoptera litura larvae, a dominant herbivore, was
significantly less in the exposed field plots than in the unexposed plots. Under 
laboratory conditions, cut goldenrod volatiles induced the direct defenses of
soybean plants against S. litura larvae and at least three major compounds,
α-pinene, β-myrcene, and limonene, of cut goldenrod volatiles were involved in
the induction. The number of undamaged seeds from the exposed plants was
significantly higher than that from unexposed ones. Concentrations of isoflavones
in the seeds were significantly higher in seeds from the exposed plants than in
those from the unexposed plants. Future research evaluating the utility of
weeding volatiles, as a form of plant-plant communications, in pest management
programs is necessary.

Understanding how plants respond to water deficit is important in order to
develop crops tolerant to drought. In this study, we compare two large
metabolomics datasets where we employed a nontargeted metabolomics approach to
elucidate metabolic pathways perturbed by progressive dehydration in tobacco and 
soybean plants. The two datasets were created using the same strategy to create
water deficit conditions and an identical metabolomics pipeline. Comparisons
between the two datasets therefore reveal common responses between the two
species, responses specific to one of the species, responses that occur in both
root and leaf tissues, and responses that are specific to one tissue. Stomatal
closure is the immediate response of the plant and this did not coincide with
accumulation of abscisic acid. A total of 116 and 140 metabolites were observed
in tobacco leaves and roots, respectively, while 241 and 207 were observed in
soybean leaves and roots, respectively. Accumulation of metabolites is
significantly correlated with the extent of dehydration in both species. Among
the metabolites that show increases that are restricted to just one plant,
4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric acid (KHG) in tobacco roots and coumestrol in soybean
roots show the highest tissue-specific accumulation. The comparisons of these two
large nontargeted metabolomics datasets provide novel information and suggest
that KHG will be a useful marker for drought stress for some members of
Solanaceae and coumestrol for some legume species.

In utero environment is known to affect fetal development. Especially, the
distinct fetal programming of carcinogenesis was reported in offspring exposed to
maternal diets containing soy protein isolate (SPI) or genistein. Therefore, we
investigated whether maternal consumption of low-isoflavone SPI or genistein
alters hepatic gene expression and liver development in rat offspring. Female
Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a casein diet, a low-isoflavone SPI diet or a casein
diet supplemented with genistein (250 mg/kg diet) for 2 weeks before mating and
throughout pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were studied on postnatal day 
21 (CAS, SPI and GEN groups). Among 965 differentially expressed hepatic genes
related to maternal diet (P&lt;.05), the expression of 590 was significantly
different between CAS and SPI groups. Conversely, the expression of 88 genes was 
significantly different between CAS and GEN groups. Especially, genes involved in
drug metabolism were significantly affected by the maternal diet. SPI group
showed increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and activation of the mTOR
pathway, which may contribute to a higher relative liver weight compared to other
groups. We observed higher serum homocysteine levels and lower global and CpG
site-specific DNA methylation of Gadd45b, a gene involved in cell proliferation
and apoptosis, in SPI group compared to CAS group. Maternal SPI diet also reduced
histone H3-Lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation and increased H3K9 acetylation in
offspring. These results demonstrate that maternal consumption of a
low-isoflavone SPI diet alters the hepatic gene expression profile and liver
development in offspring possibly by epigenetic processes.

We studied the effects of hardwood-derived biochar (BC) and the
phytohormone-producing endophyte Galactomyces geotrichum WLL1 in soybean (Glycine
max (L.) Merr.) with respect to basic, macro- and micronutrient uptakes and
assimilations, and their subsequent effects on the regulation of functional amino
acids, isoflavones, fatty acid composition, total sugar contents, total phenolic 
contents, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-scavenging activity. The
assimilation of basic nutrients such as nitrogen was up-regulated, leaving
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen unaffected in BC+G. geotrichum-treated soybean
plants. In comparison, the uptakes of macro- and micronutrients fluctuated in the
individual or co-application of BC and G. geotrichum in soybean plant organs and 
rhizospheric substrate. Moreover, the same attribute was recorded for the
regulation of functional amino acids, isoflavones, fatty acid composition, total 
sugar contents, total phenolic contents, and DPPH-scavenging activity.
Collectively, these results showed that BC+G. geotrichum-treated soybean yielded 
better results than did the plants treated with individual applications. It was
concluded that BC is an additional nutriment source and that the G. geotrichum
acts as a plant biostimulating source and the effects of both are additive
towards plant growth promotion. Strategies involving the incorporation of BC and 
endophytic symbiosis may help achieve eco-friendly agricultural production, thus 
reducing the excessive use of chemical agents.

Daidzein, which is scarce in nature, has gained significant attention due to its 
superior biological activity and bioavailability compared with daidzin. So far,
it has been widely used in the medicine and health care products industries. The 
enzymatic approach for the preparation of daidzein has prevailed, benefitted by
its high efficiency and eco-friendly nature. Our present research aimed at
providing a preparation method of daidzein by enzymatic hydrolysis of daidzin in 
a new "green" reaction medium-deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Herein, the DESs
were screened via evaluating enzyme activity, enzyme stability and the substrate 
solubility, and the DES (ChCl/EG 2:1, 30 vol %) was believed to be the most
appropriate co-solvent to improve the bioconversion efficiency. Based on the
yield of daidzein, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to model and
optimize the reaction parameters. Under these optimum process conditions, the
maximum yield of 97.53% was achieved and the purity of daidzein crude product
reached more than 70%, which is more efficient than conversions in DESs-free
buffer. Importantly, it has been shown that DESs medium could be reused for six
batches of the process with a final conversion of above 50%. The results
indicated that this procedure could be considered a mild, environmentally
friendly, highly efficient approach to the economical production of daidzein,
with a simple operation process and without any harmful reagents being involved.

A pivotal role in osteoporosis development is played by radical oxygen species
(ROS), the increased production of which is related to inhibited osteoblastic
activity and bone formation. A new field of research could involve medicinal
plants with antioxidant and protective effects in osteoporosis. Furthermore,
considering the multifactorial metabolic aspects of osteoporosis, the
pharmacological association of multiple medicinal plants could improve patient
response. The aim of the present study is to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the
protective effects of a natural formula containing lactoferrin 12%, Equisetum
arvensis ES 54%, soy isoflavones 34% and vitamin D3 0.002%, in PBMC and C2C12
cells and in the bone matrix of young (3-month-old) and aged (12-month-old)
female Sprague-Dawley rats, following chronic (21 days) administration. In this
context, we assayed the activities of several inflammation and bone homeostasis
mediators, such as IL-6, TNFα, PGE2, osteoprotegerin, RANK, RANKL and NFkB. In
vitro studies showed that natural formula (5-1000μg/ml) was able to significantly
inhibit ROS and PGE2 production. In the same concentration range, the natural
formula inhibited both TNFα and IL-6 gene expression. In the in vivo studies, we 
administered to young and aged female rats the natural formula at 5mg/rat for 21 
days, finding a significant reduction in inflammatory PGE2 and NFkB activity.
Nevertheless, we observed a significant increase in osteoprotegerin/RANKL ratio
only in aged rats, compared to the respective control group. In conclusion, our
findings corroborate the rational use of natural formula in the prevention and
management of osteoporotic disease.

BACKGROUND: Isoflavonoids are a class of specialized metabolites found
predominantly in legumes. They play a role in signaling for symbiosis with
nitrogen-fixing bacteria and inhibiting pathogen infection.
RESULTS: A transcriptomic approach using soybean cultivars with high (Conrad and 
AC Colombe) and low (AC Glengarry and Pagoda) root isoflavonoid content was used 
to find elements that underlie this variation. Two genes, encoding the
flavonoid-metabolizing enzymes, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (GmF3'H) and
dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (GmDFR), had lower expression levels in high
isoflavonoid cultivars. These enzymes compete with isoflavonoid biosynthetic
enzymes for the important branch-point substrate naringenin and its derivatives. 
Differentially expressed genes, between the two sets of cultivars, encode
transcription factors, transporters and enzymatic families of interest, such as
oxidoreductases, hydrolases and transferases. In addition, genes annotated with
stress and disease response were upregulated in high isoflavonoid cultivars.
CONCLUSIONS: Coordinated regulation of genes involved in flavonoid metabolism
could redirect flux into the isoflavonoid branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway, 
by reducing competition for the flavanone substrate. These candidate genes could 
help identify mechanisms to overcome the endogenous bottleneck to isoflavonoid
production, facilitate biosynthesis in heterologous systems, and enhance crop
resistance against pathogenic infections.

The effects of storage duration on the seed germination and metabolite profiling 
of soybean seeds with five different coloured coats were studied. Their
germination, constituents and transcript expressions of isoflavones and free
fatty acids (FFAs) were compared using chromatographic metabolomic profiling and 
transcriptome sequencing. The seed water content was characterized using nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. Results showed that dark-coloured seeds
were less inactivated than light-coloured seeds. The aglycone and β-glucoside
concentrations of upstream constituents increased significantly, whereas the
acetylglucosides and malonylglucosides of downstream constituents decreased with 
an increase in the storage period. FFAs increased considerably in the soybean
seeds as a result of storage. These results indicate that dark-coloured soybean
seeds have better storability than light-coloured seeds, and seed water content
plays a role in seed inactivation. It was concluded that there are certain
metabolic regularities that are associated with different coloured seed coats of 
soybeans under storage conditions.

High dietary intake of plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) can affect brain
structure and function. The effects of phytoestrogen intake within the range of
normal animal and human dietary consumption, however, remain uncertain. The aim
of the present study was to determine the effects of the isoflavonoids present in
a standard low phytoestrogen laboratory rat chow on spine synapse density in the 
stratum radiatum of area CA1 of the hippocampus. Weanling rats (22days old) were 
fed either standard chow (Teklad 2018), a nutritionally comparable diet without
soy (Teklad 2016) or a custom diet containing Teklad 2016 supplemented with the
principal soy isoflavonoids, daidzein and genistein, for 40days. Rats were
ovariectomized at 54days of age. Eight days later, spine synapse density on the
apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the stratum radiatum of area
CA1 was measured by electron microscopic stereological analysis. Animals
maintained on Teklad 2016 exhibited an approximately 60% lower CA1 spine synapse 
density than animals consuming Teklad 2018. Replacing genistein and daidzein in
Teklad 2016 returned synapse density to levels indistinguishable from those in
animals on Teklad 2018. These results indicate that the isoflavonoids in a
standard laboratory rat diet exert significant effects on spine synapse density
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Since changes in spine synapse density in
this region of the hippocampus have been linked to cognitive performance and mood
state, these data suggest that even relatively low daily consumption of soy
phytoestrogens may be sufficient to influence hippocampal function.

BACKGROUND: Isoflavones are biologically active compounds that occur naturally in
a variety of plants, with relatively high levels in soybean. Tectorigenin, an
isoflavone, protects against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell damage.
However, the underlying mechanism is unknown.
METHODS: The MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability. Catalase
activity was assessed by determining the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1
μM H2O2. Protein expression of catalase, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK), IκB-α, and NF-κB were evaluated by Western blot analysis. A
mobility shift assay was performed to assess the DNA-binding ability of NF-κB.
Transient transfection and a NF-κB luciferase assay were performed to assess
transcriptional activity.
RESULTS: Tectorigenin reduced H2O2-induced death of Chinese hamster lung
fibroblasts (V79-4). In addition, tectorigenin increased the activity and protein
expression of catalase. Blockade of catalase activity attenuated the protective
effect of tectorigenin against oxidative stress. Furthermore, tectorigenin
enhanced phosphorylation of ERK and nuclear expression of NF-κB, while inhibition
of ERK and NF-κB attenuated the protective effect of tectorigenin against
oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Tectorigenin protects cells against oxidative damage by activating
catalase and modulating the ERK and NF-κB signaling pathway.

Soybean isoflavones (SIs) are phytoestrogens that competitive with estrogens in
body. Although SIs play an important role in reproduction, their role in
testicular development in roosters is unknown. This study was conducted to
investigate the effect of SIs on testicular development and serum reproductive
hormone profiles in young breeder roosters (70-133days old). Gene expression of
steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage
enzyme (P450scc), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), which are related
to testosterone synthesis, in rooster testis were also evaluated after treatment 
with different SI doses. Although SIs had no significant effect on body weight,
5mg/kg SIs significantly increased the testis index and serum levels of
reproductive hormones (gonadotropin releasing hormone, follicle- stimulating
hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone).To further investigate whether
SIs regulate hormone synthesis via StAR, p450scc, 3β-HSD, real time-PCR was
performed to measure the mRNA levels of the corresponding genes. The results
showed that 5mg/kg of SIs significantly increased StAR mRNA levels. However,
there were no significant effects on p450scc or 3β-HSD mRNA levels. Moreover, the
spermatogonial development and the number of germ cell layers were increased by
treatment with 5mg/kg of SIs. These results suggest that SIs promote testicular
growth by increasing reproductive hormone secretion, which is closely related to 
StAR expression, to positively regulate reproduction in young roosters.

The effect of supplementing a basal diet for dairy cows with "Soybean extract 40"
(Biomedica, Prague, Czech Republic), containing 40% soybean isoflavones, on the
contents of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and equol in milk as well as fresh
and mature yogurts was estimated. To determine the contents of these
isoflavonoids, an efficient analytical LC-MS (TOF) technique was used. The
"Soybean extract 40" used in our study contained an especially high proportion of
daidzein (307gkg-1). In both milk and yogurt samples, the amounts of daidzein and
its metabolite equol were significantly higher in samples obtained from cows that
received the isoflavone extract-supplemented diet than from those that received
the basal diet, as the precursor daidzein contributed to the increased equol
concentrations. Fermentation caused significant changes in the daidzein and
glycitein concentrations. With maturation, the concentrations of daidzein and
equol were unaffected, while the glycitein concentration decreased significantly.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between reproductive history
indicators of hormonal exposure, including reproductive period, pregnancy, and
use of hormonal contraceptives, and mid- and late-life cognition in
postmenopausal women.
DESIGN: Analysis of baseline data from two randomized clinical trials: the
Women's Isoflavone Soy Health and the Early vs Late Intervention Trial of
Estradiol.
SETTING: University academic research center.
PARTICIPANTS: Naturally menopausal women (N = 830).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants were uniformly evaluated using a cognitive battery and
a structured reproductive history questionnaire. Outcomes were composite scores
for verbal episodic memory, executive function, and global cognition.
Reproductive variables included ages at pregnancies, menarche, and menopause;
reproductive period; number of pregnancies; and use of hormones for contraception
and menopausal symptoms. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate
associations between cognitive scores (dependent variable) and reproductive
factors (independent variables), adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, income,
and education.
RESULTS: On multivariable modeling, age at menarche of 13 and older was inversely
associated with global cognition (P = .05). Last pregnancy after age 35 was
positively associated with verbal memory (P = .03). Use of hormonal
contraceptives was positively associated with global cognition (P trend = .04),
and verbal memory (P trend = .007). The association between hormonal
contraceptive use and verbal memory and executive function was strongest for more
than 10 years of use. Reproductive period was positively associated with global
cognition (P = .04) and executive function (P = .04).
CONCLUSION: In this sample of healthy postmenopausal women, reproductive life
events related to sex hormones, including earlier age at menarche, later age at
last pregnancy, longer reproductive period, and use of oral contraceptives are
positively related to aspects of cognition in later life.

Soybean (Glycine max) accumulates several prenylated isoflavonoid phytoalexins,
collectively referred to as glyceollins. Glyceollins (I, II, III, IV and V)
possess modified pterocarpan skeletons with C5 moieties from dimethylallyl
diphosphate, and they are commonly produced from (6aS,
11aS)-3,9,6a-trihydroxypterocarpan [(-)-glycinol]. The metabolic fate of
(-)-glycinol is determined by the enzymatic introduction of a dimethylallyl group
into C-4 or C-2, which is reportedly catalyzed by regiospecific
prenyltransferases (PTs). 4-Dimethylallyl (-)-glycinol and 2-dimethylallyl
(-)-glycinol are precursors of glyceollin I and other glyceollins, respectively. 
Although multiple genes encoding (-)-glycinol biosynthetic enzymes have been
identified, those involved in the later steps of glyceollin formation mostly
remain unidentified, except for (-)-glycinol 4-dimethylallyltransferase (G4DT),
which is involved in glyceollin I biosynthesis. In this study, we identified four
genes that encode isoflavonoid PTs, including (-)-glycinol
2-dimethylallyltransferase (G2DT), using homology-based in silico screening and
biochemical characterization in yeast expression systems. Transcript analyses
illustrated that changes in G2DT gene expression were correlated with the
induction of glyceollins II, III, IV and V in elicitor-treated soybean cells and 
leaves, suggesting its involvement in glyceollin biosynthesis. Moreover, the
genomic signatures of these PT genes revealed that G4DT and G2DT are paralogs
derived from whole-genome duplications of the soybean genome, whereas other PT
genes [isoflavone dimethylallyltransferase 1 (IDT1) and IDT2] were derived via
local gene duplication on soybean chromosome 11.

The present study describes the biotransformation of a commercially available
crude extract of soy isoflavones, which contained significant amounts of the soy 
isoflavone glycosides daidzin and genistin, by recombinant Escherichia coli
expressing tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium. Two major products were isolated 
from the biotransformation and identified as 3'-hydroxydaidzin and
3'-hydroxygenistin, respectively, based on their mass and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectral data. The two 3'-hydroxyisoflavone glycosides showed potent
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity with IC50 values
of 7.4 and 9.8 μM for 3'-hydroxydaidzin and 3'-hydroxygenistin, respectively. The
free radical scavenging activities of the two 3'-hydroxyisoflavone glycosides
were, respectively, 120 and 72 times higher than the activity of their
precursors, daidzin and genistin, and were also stronger than the activity of
ascorbic acid, which showed an IC50 value of 15.1 μM. This is the first report of
the bio-production and potential antioxidant applications of both
3'-hydroxydaidzin and 3'-hydroxygenistin.

BACKGROUND: Isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are produced in soybean 
seed [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and may be associated with health benefits in the
human diet. More research is required to determine the effect of agronomic
soybean treatments on isoflavone concentration. In this study from 2012 to 2014
at Michigan State University and Breckenridge locations, we have evaluated
agronomic input management systems which are marketed to increase or protect
potential soybean grain yield, including: nitrogen fertilization,
herbicide-defoliant, foliar applied fertilizer, a biological-based foliar
application, foliar applied fungicide, foliar applied insecticide, a seed applied
fungicide, and a maximized seed treatment that included fungicide and insecticide
as well as an inoculant and lipo-chitooligosaccharide nodulation promoter, for
their effect on soybean seed genistein and daidzein concentrations.
RESULTS: Paired comparisons were made between treatments receiving a designated
management input and those without the input. Year and location had a significant
effect on isoflavone concentrations. Agronomic management inputs impacted soybean
seed daidzein concentrations in 15 of 48 field observations and genistein
concentrations in 11 of 48 observations.
CONCLUSION: The research supports findings that soybean seed isoflavone levels
exhibit a location specific response, and the temporal variability experienced
between years appears to influence changes in soybean isoflavone levels more than
location. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

The effects of the size and content of soy protein isolate (SPI) aggregates on
the rheological and textural properties of CaSO4-induced SPI emulsion gels were
investigated. Considerable differences in the rheological, water-holding, and
micro-structural properties were observed. The gels with larger and/or more SPI
aggregates showed substantial increase in the elastic modulus and had lower
gelation temperatures. Creep data suggested that the size of the SPI aggregates
contributed more to the elastic modulus, whereas the increase of aggregate
content enhanced the elastic modulus and viscous component of the gels. The
water-holding capacity was markedly enhanced (p&lt;0.05) with the increase in both
the size and content of SPI aggregates. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and
scanning electron microscopy showed that larger and/or more SPI aggregates
resulted in more homogeneous networks with smaller oil droplets. These insights
provide important information for the product development in relation to soy
protein-stabilized emulsions and emulsion gels.

As a traditional soybean product with good quality and a healthy food with many
functional components, tofu is increasingly consumed in people's daily life.
Traditional tofu processing consists of numerous steps, including the soaking and
grinding of soybean seeds, heating of the soybean slurry, filtering, and addition
of coagulants, and others. The properties of soybean seeds, processing scale,
soaking and heating conditions, type and concentration of coagulant, and other
factors collectively impact the processing steps and the final tofu quality. The 
generation of whole soybean tofu with more nutritive value comparing with
traditional tofu has been successfully reported by several studies. As one of the
most important functional component, isoflavones and their presence in tofu are
also influenced by the above-mentioned factors, which influence the nutritive
value of tofu. Research investigating the influence of tofu processing conditions
on the quality and isoflavone profiles of tofu are the subject of this review.
Issues that should be further studied to investigate the influence of processing 
conditions on the quality and nutritive value of tofu are also introduced.

Soy Isoflavone Intake and Sleep Parameters over 5 Years among Chinese Adults:
Longitudinal Analysis from the Jiangsu Nutrition Study.

Cao Y, Taylor AW, Zhen S, Adams R, Appleton S, Shi Z.

BACKGROUND: Soy isoflavone is beneficial for menopausal/postmenopausal symptoms, 
including sleep complaints. However, little is known about its longitudinal
association with sleep in the general population.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the association between soy isoflavone
intake and sleep duration and daytime falling asleep among Chinese adults.
DESIGN: A longitudinal analysis was performed. Soy isoflavone intake was assessed
by food frequency questionnaire. Sleep duration was self-reported at two time
points. Occurrence of daytime falling asleep was determined at follow-up. Short
and long sleep were defined as sleep &lt;7 h/day or ≥9 h/day, respectively.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Adults aged 20 years and older from the Jiangsu Nutrition
Study (2002-2007) with complete isoflavone intake and sleep duration data at both
time points (n=1,474) were analyzed (follow-up, n=1,492).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured sleep duration in 2002 and 2007 and daytime
falling asleep occurrence in&nbsp;2007.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed
for repeated measures between isoflavone intake and sleep duration. Logistic
regression was performed for daytime falling asleep at follow-up. Demographic,
anthropometric, and social factors were adjusted in the analyses.
RESULTS: The prevalence of long sleep duration was 18.9% in 2002 and 12.6% in
2007, and the prevalence of daytime falling asleep was 5.3%. Compared with the
lowest quartile of isoflavone intake, the highest quartile was associated with a 
lower risk of long sleep duration (odds ratio=0.66; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90; P for
trend=0.018) over 5 years. Compared with persistent low intake of isoflavone
(less than median intake of isoflavone at two time points), persistent high
intake was associated with a reduced risk of daytime falling asleep in women
(odds ratio=0.20; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68), but not men. No consistent association
between soy isoflavone intake and short sleep duration was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavone intake was associated with a low risk of long sleep
duration in both sexes and a low risk of daytime falling asleep in women but not 
men.

Whereas a number of studies have examined the effects of soy isoflavones and
tocopherols on colonic inflammation, few have examined soy protein. We determined
the radical scavenging and cytoprotective effects of soy protein concentrate
(SPC) in vitro and its anti-inflammatory effects in dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-treated mice. Cotreatment with SPC protected Caco-2 human colon cells from 
H2O2-induced cell death and mitigated intracellular oxidative stress. Treatment
of differentiated Caco-2 cells with SPC blunted DSS-induced increases in
monolayer permeability. Pepsin/pancreatin-digested SPC had reduced radical
scavenging activity, but retained the monolayer protective effects of SPC. In
vivo, 1.5% DSS caused body weight loss, colon shortening, and splenomegaly in
CF-1 mice. Co-treatment with 12% SPC mitigated DSS-induced body weight loss and
splenomegaly. DSS increased colonic interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 expression. The levels of these markers were significantly 
lower in mice co-treated with SPC. SPC prevented DSS-mediated reductions in
colonic glucagon-like peptide 2 levels, suggesting that SPC can prevent loss of
gut barrier function, but no significant effect on claudin 1 and occludin mRNA
levels of was observed. SPC-treated mice had lower colonic mRNA expression of
toll-like receptor 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
protein-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3), and
lower caspase-1 enzyme activity than DSS-treated mice. In summary, SPC exerted
antioxidant and cytoprotective effects in vitro and moderated the severity of
DSS-induced inflammation and loss of gut barrier function in vivo. These effects 
appear to be mediated in part through reduced NLRP3 expression and caspase 1
activity.

Soybean isoflavone genistein has multiple anticancer properties and its
pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects have been studied in different
cancer cells. However, the mechanisms of action of genistein and its molecular
targets on human colon cells have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, caspase-3
and p38&nbsp;mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) as the main therapeutic
targets were investigated in this study at both gene expression and protein
levels in HT29 colon cancer cells. The caspase-3 and p38 MAPK gene expression
levels were examined by real time PCR whereas flow cytometry technique was
performed to determine their intracellular protein levels. The caspase-3 enzyme
activity was obtained by colorimetric method while the gelatinase activity of
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) was determined by zymography. In addition, MTT 
test, wound healing assay and clonogenic assay were carried out to determine the 
effect of genistein on HT29 cell viability, migration, and proliferation,
respectively. Genistein induced apoptotic death in HT29 cells through activation 
of caspase-3 pathway at the transcriptional, protein, and enzymatic levels.
Moreover, genistein inhibited the proliferation of HT29 cells by reducing of both
p38 MAPK gene expression and its active phosphorylated protein level. Also, we
showed that genistein strongly suppressed the metastatic potency of HT29 colon
cancer cells via the reduction of MMP2 activity. Based on the results of this
study, we conclude that genistein may exhibit its anticancer properties on HT29
colon cancer cells by modulating caspase-3 and p38 MAPK pathway at different
transcriptional and protein levels.

Seedpods are the outermost barrier of legume plants encountered by pests and
pathogens, but research on this tissue, especially regarding their chemical
constituents, is limited. In the present study, a mildew-index-model-based
cluster analysis was used to evaluate and identify groups of soybean genotypes
with different organ-specific resistance against field mold. The constituents of 
soybean pods, including proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and isoflavones,
were analyzed. Linear regression and correlation analyses were also conducted
between these main pod constituents and the organ-specific mildew indexes of seed
(MIS) and pod (MIP). With increases in the contents of infection constituents,
such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids, the MIP increased and the MIS
decreased. The MIS decreased with increases in the contents of glycitein
(GLE)-type isoflavonoids, which act as antibiotic constituents. Although the
infection constituents in the soybean pods caused pod mildew, they also helped
mitigate the corresponding seed mildew to a certain extent.

BACKGROUND: Whether soy intake is associated with a decreased risk of
cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. A traditional Japanese soy food,
natto, contains a potent fibrinolytic enzyme. However, its relation to CVD has
not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association of CVD mortality with the intake
of natto, soy protein, and soy isoflavones in a population-based cohort study in 
Japan.
DESIGN: The study included 13,355 male and 15,724 female Takayama Study
participants aged ≥35 y. At recruitment in 1992, each subject was administered a 
validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Deaths from CVD were
ascertained over 16 y.
RESULTS: A total of 1678 deaths from CVD including 677 stroke and 308 ischemic
heart disease occurred during follow-up. The highest quartile of natto intake
compared with the lowest intake was significantly associated with a decreased
risk of mortality from total CVD after control for covariates: the HR was 0.75
(95% CI: 0.64, 0.88, P-trend = 0.0004). There were no significant associations
between the risk of mortality from total CVD and intakes of total soy protein,
total soy isoflavone, and soy protein or soy isoflavone from soy foods other than
natto. The highest quartiles of total soy protein and natto intakes were
significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality from total stroke (HR
= 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.99, P-trend = 0.03 and HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.88,
P-trend = 0.0004, respectively). The highest quartile of natto intake was also
significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality from ischemic stroke 
(HR = 0.67, 95% CI:0.47, 0.95, P-trend = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Data suggest that natto intake may contribute to the reduction of CVD
mortality.

CONTEXT: Soy is the main source of phytoestrogens, which has long been used as
traditional food. One major subtype of phytoestrogens includes isoflavones and
they are scientifically validated for their beneficial actions on many
hormone-dependent conditions.
OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the effect of soy isoflavones on
letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCOS was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with of 1 mg/kg
letrozole, p.o. once daily for 21 consecutive days. Soy isoflavones (50 and
100 mg/kg) was administered for 14 days after PCOS induction. Physical parameters
(body weight, oestrous cycle determination, ovary and uterus weight) metabolic
parameters (oral glucose tolerance test, total cholesterol), steroidal hormone
profile (testosterone and 17β-oestradiol), steroidogenic enzymes (3β-hydroxy
steroid dehydrogenase (HSD) and 17β-HSD), oxidative stress and histopathology of 
ovary were studied.
RESULTS: Soy isoflavones (100 mg/kg) treatment significantly altered the
letrozole-induced PCOS symptoms as observed by decreased body weight gain
(p &lt; 0.05), percentage diestrous phase (p &lt; 0.001), testosterone (p &lt; 0.001),
3β-HSD (p &lt; 0.01) and 17β-HSD (p &lt; 0.001) enzyme activity and oxidative stress.
Histological results reveal that soy isoflavones treatment in PCOS rats resulted 
in well-developed antral follicles and normal granulosa cell layer in rat ovary.
DISCUSSION: Treatment with soy isoflavones exerts beneficial effects in PCOS rats
(with decreased aromatase activity) which might be due to their ability to
decrease testosterone concentration in the peripheral blood.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of physical, biochemical and histological evidences shows
that soy isoflavones may be beneficial in PCOS.

Animal Breeding and Nutrition, Guangzhou 510640, China.

To investigate the effect of glycitein, a synthetic soybean isoflavone (ISF), on 
the intestinal antioxidant capacity, morphology, and cytokine content in young
piglets fed oxidized fish oil, 72 4-d-old male piglets were assigned to three
treatments. The control group was fed a basal diet containing fresh fish oil, and
the other two groups received the same diet except for the substitution with the 
same dosage of oxidized fish oil alone or with ISF (oxidized fish oil plus ISF). 
After 21 d of feeding, supplementation of oxidized fish oil increased the levels 
of malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), nuclear factor κ B
(NF-κB), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NO, and Caspase-3 in jejunal
mucosa, and decreased the villous height in duodenum and the levels of secretory 
immunoglobulin A (sIgA) and IL-4 in the jejunal mucosa compared with
supplementation with fresh oil. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus ISF
partially alleviated this negative effect. The addition of oxidized fish oil plus
ISF increased the villous height and levels of sIgA and IL-4 in jejunal mucosa,
but decreased the levels of IL-1β and IL-2 in jejunal mucosa (P&lt;0.05) compared
with oxidized fish oil. Collectively, these results show that dietary
supplementation of ISF could partly alleviate the negative effect of oxidized
fish oil by improving the intestinal morphology as well as the antioxidant
capacity and immune function in young piglets.

Coumestrol is a phytoestrogen present in soybean products and recognized as
potential cancer therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, the clear
molecular mechanism of anticancer-activity of coumestrol in breast carcinoma has 
not been reported. It is well established that copper levels are elevated in
different malignancies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate
the copper-dependent cytotoxic action of coumestrol in human breast cancer
MCF-7&nbsp;cells. Results showed that coumestrol inhibited proliferation and induced
apoptosis in MCF-7&nbsp;cells, which was prevented by copper chelator neocuproine and 
ROS scavengers. Coumestrol treatment induced ROS generation coupled to DNA
fragmentation, up-regulation of p53/p21, cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase,
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspases 9/3 activation. All these
effects were suppressed by ROS scavengers and neocuproine. These results suggest 
that coumestrol targets elevated copper for redox cycling to generate ROS leading
to DNA fragmentation. DNA damage leads to p53 up-regulation which directs the
cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis of
MCF-7&nbsp;cells. In conclusion, copper targeted ROS-mediated p53-dependent mechanism 
better explains the cytotoxic action of coumestrol in MCF-7&nbsp;cells. Thus,
targeting elevated copper levels might be a potential therapeutic strategy for
selective cytotoxic action against malignant cells.

Soyfoods have long been recognized as sources of high-quality protein and
healthful fat, but over the past 25 years these foods have been rigorously
investigated for their role in chronic disease prevention and treatment. There is
evidence, for example, that they reduce risk of coronary heart disease and breast
and prostate cancer. In addition, soy alleviates hot flashes and may favorably
affect renal function, alleviate depressive symptoms and improve skin health.
Much of the focus on soyfoods is because they are uniquely-rich sources of
isoflavones. Isoflavones are classified as both phytoestrogens and selective
estrogen receptor modulators. Despite the many proposed benefits, the presence of
isoflavones has led to concerns that soy may exert untoward effects in some
individuals. However, these concerns are based primarily on animal studies,
whereas the human research supports the safety and benefits of soyfoods. In
support of safety is the recent conclusion of the European Food Safety Authority 
that isoflavones do not adversely affect the breast, thyroid or uterus of
postmenopausal women. This review covers each of the major research areas
involving soy focusing primarily on the clinical and epidemiologic research.
Background information on Asian soy intake, isoflavones, and nutrient content is 
also provided.

Rhizodeposits play a key role in shaping rhizosphere microbial communities. In
soybean, isoflavonoids are a key rhizodeposit component that aid in plant defense
and enable symbiotic associations with rhizobia. However, it is uncertain if and 
how they influence rhizosphere microbial communities. Isoflavonoid biosynthesis
was silenced via RNA interference of isoflavone synthase in soybean hairy root
composite plants. Rhizosphere soil fractions tightly associated with roots were
isolated, and PCR amplicons from 16S rRNA gene variable regions V1-V3 and V3-V5
from these fractions were sequenced using 454. The resulting data was resolved
using MOTHUR and vegan to identify bacterial taxa and evaluate changes in
rhizosphere bacterial communities. The soybean rhizosphere was enriched in
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and had relatively lower levels of
Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria compared with bulk soil. Isoflavonoids had a
small effect on bacterial community structure, and in particular on the abundance
of Xanthomonads and Comamonads. The effect of hairy root transformation on
rhizosphere bacterial communities was largely similar to untransformed plant
roots with approximately 74% of the bacterial families displaying similar
colonization underscoring the suitability of this technique to evaluate the
influence of plant roots on rhizosphere bacterial communities. However, hairy
root transformation had notable influence on Sphingomonads and Acidobacteria.

Pterocarpans are known to have antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties.
However, little is known about the changes in transcriptional profiles in
response to a pterocarpan-high soybean leaf extract (PT). Therefore, this study
investigated the effects of PT on blood glucose and lipid levels, as well as on
the inflammation-related gene expression based on a peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) mRNA sequencing analysis in Korean overweight and obese subjects
with mild metabolic syndrome. The participants were randomly assigned to two
groups and were administered either placebo (starch, 3 g/day) or PT (2 g/day) for
12 weeks. The PT intervention did not change body weight, body fat percentage and
body mass index (BMI). However, PT significantly decreased the glycosylated
hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, free fatty acid, total cholesterol, and
non-HDL cholesterol levels after 12 weeks. Furthermore, PT supplementation
significantly lowered the homeostatic index of insulin resistance, as well as the
plasma levels of inflammatory markers. Finally, the mRNA sequencing analysis
revealed that PT downregulated genes related to immune responses. PT
supplementation is beneficial for the improvement of metabolic syndrome by
altering the fasting blood and plasma glucose, HbA1c, plasma lipid levels and
inflammation-related gene expression in PBMCs.

Chum salmon skin gelatin, de-isoflavoned soy protein, and casein were hydrolyzed 
at two degrees of hydrolysis. Genistein, the prepared hydrolysates, and
genistein-hydrolysate combinations were assessed for their proliferative and
anti-apoptotic effects on human osteoblasts (hFOB 1.19) to clarify potential
cooperative effects between genistein and these hydrolysates in these two
activities. Genistein at 2.5 μg/L demonstrated the highest proliferative
activity, while the higher dose of genistein inhibited cell growth. All
hydrolysates promoted osteoblast proliferation by increasing cell viability to
102.9%-131.1%. Regarding etoposide- or NaF-induced osteoblast apoptosis, these
hydrolysates at 0.05 g/L showed both preventive and therapeutic effects against
apoptosis. In the mode of apoptotic prevention, the hydrolysates decreased
apoptotic cells from 32.9% to 15.2%-23.7% (etoposide treatment) or from 23.6% to 
14.3%-19.6% (NaF treatment). In the mode of apoptotic rescue, the hydrolysates
lessened the extent of apoptotic cells from 15.9% to 13.0%-15.3% (etoposide
treatment) or from 13.3% to 10.9%-12.7% (NaF treatment). Gelatin hydrolysates
showed the highest activities among all hydrolysates in all cases. All
investigated combinations (especially the genistein-gelatin hydrolysate
combination) had stronger proliferation, apoptotic prevention, and rescue than
genistein itself or their counterpart hydrolysates alone, suggesting that
genistein cooperated with these hydrolysates, rendering greater activities in
osteoblast proliferation and anti-apoptosis.

Isoflavonoids are a characteristic family of natural products in legumes known to
mediate a range of plant-biotic interactions. For example, in soybean (Glycine
max: Fabaceae) multiple isoflavones are induced and accumulate in leaves
following attack by Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae. To
quantitatively examine patterns of activated de novo biosynthesis, soybean (Var. 
Enrei) leaves were treated with a combination of plant defense elicitors present 
in S. litura gut content extracts and L-α-[13C9, 15N]phenylalanine as a traceable
isoflavonoid precursor. Combined treatments promoted significant increases in
13C-labeled isoflavone aglycones (daidzein, formononetin, and genistein),
13C-labeled isoflavone 7-O-glucosides (daidzin, ononin, and genistin), and
13C-labeled isoflavone 7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-glucosides) (malonyldaidzin,
malonylononin, and malonylgenistin). In contrast levels of 13C-labeled flavones
and flavonol (4',7-dihydroxyflavone, kaempferol, and apigenin) were not
significantly altered. Curiously, application of fatty acid-amino acid conjugate 
(FAC) elicitors present in S. litura gut contents, namely
N-linolenoyl-L-glutamine and N-linoleoyl-L-glutamine, both promoted the induced
accumulation of isoflavone 7-O-glucosides and isoflavone
7-O-(6″-O-malonyl-β-glucosides), but not isoflavone aglycones in the leaves.
These results demonstrate that at least two separate reactions are involved in
elicitor-induced soybean leaf responses to the S. litura gut contents: one is the
de novo biosynthesis of isoflavone conjugates induced by FACs, and the other is
the hydrolysis of the isoflavone conjugates to yield isoflavone aglycones. Gut
content extracts alone displayed no hydrolytic activity. The quantitative
analysis of isoflavone de novo biosynthesis, with respect to both aglycones and
conjugates, affords a useful bioassay system for the discovery of additional
plant defense elicitor(s) in S. litura gut contents that specifically promote
hydrolysis of isoflavone conjugates.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, natural compounds called "phytochemicals", which are
present in fruits, vegetables, and plants, have received special attention due to
their potential to interfere with tumour formation and development. Many of these
phytochemicals are being used in chemoprevention strategies. However, the
scientific evidence regarding the modification of cancer risk continues to be
debated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to review the current scientific evidence and
the most relevant epidemiological studies regarding the consumption or use of
phytochemicals and their effects on the incidence of cancer.
DESIGN: A search for relevant articles was conducted in EMBASE and PubMed-NCBI
through to May 2016 to identify potential interactions between the consumption or
use of phytochemicals and cancer risk.
RESULTS: The use or consumption of carotenoids, such as lycopene, alpha-carotene,
and betacarotene, leads to a reduction in the risk of cancer, such as breast and 
prostate tumours. For breast cancer, beta-carotene even reduces the risk of
recurrence. The use or consumption of soybean isoflavones has led to a reduction 
in the risk of lung, prostate, colon (in women only), and breast cancers,
although this has depended on menopausal and oestrogen receptor status. The use
or consumption of isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol also seems to reduce the 
risk of cancer, such as breast, stomach, colorectal, or prostate tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a diet rich in phytochemicals is associated with a
modification of cancer risk. However, the scientific data supporting its use come
mainly from in vitro and in vivo studies (especially in animal models). The
epidemiological evidence is inconclusive for many of these phytochemicals, so
further studies are needed.

In this study, to investigate the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in
nitric oxide-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (NO-cGMP)-induced isoflavone
accumulation in soybean sprouts under UV-B radiation, the sprouts were treated
with donors and inhibitors of NO and cGMP as well as IP3 inhibitor. Results
showed that NO, with cGMP as a second messenger, stimulates IP3 accumulation
under UV-B radiation. Consistent with the increase in IP3 content, the
up-regulation of gene and protein expression of phosphoinositide-specific
phospholipase C (PI-PLC) in response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (exogenous NO 
donor) and 8-Br-cGMP (cGMP analogue) was also observed. In addition, protein
kinase G (PKG) participated in NO-cGMP-induced IP3 production. IP3 induced by the
NO-cGMP pathway was involved in isoflavone synthesis by elevating the activity
and gene and protein expressions of chalcone synthase (CHS) and isoflavone
synthase (IFS). Overall, IP3 mediates NO-cGMP-induced isoflavone accumulation in 
soybean sprouts under UV-B stress.

This study was performed to evaluate the effect of concomitant supplementation of
genistein and silicon on bone mineral density and bone metabolism-related markers
in ovariectomized rat. Three-month-old Sprague Dawley female rats were subjected 
to bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgery, and then the OVX rats were
randomly divided into four groups: OVX-GEN, OVX-Si, OVX-GEN-Si, and OVX.
Genistein and silicon supplementation was started immediately after OVX and
continued for 10&nbsp;weeks. In the OVX-GEN group, 5&nbsp;mg genistein per gram body weight
was injected subcutaneously. The OVX-Si group was given soluble silicon daily in 
demineralized water (Si 20&nbsp;mg/kg body weight/day). The OVX-GEN-Si group was given
subcutaneous injections of 5&nbsp;mg genistein per gram body weight, at the same time,
given soluble silicon daily (Si 20&nbsp;mg/kg body weight/day). The results showed
that the genistein supplementation in the OVX rats significantly prevented the
loss of uterus weight; however, the silicon supplementation showed no effect on
the uterus weight loss. The lumbar spine and femur bone mineral density was
significantly decreased after OVX surgery; however, this decrease was inhibited
by the genistein and/or silicon, and the BMD of the lumbar spine and femur was
the highest in the OVX-GEN-Si-treated group. Histomorphometric analyses showed
that the supplementation of genistein and/or silicon restored bone volume and
trabecular thickness of femoral trabecular bone in the OVX group. Besides, the
treatment with genistein and silicon for 10&nbsp;weeks increased the serum levels of
calcium and phosphorus in the OVX rats; serum calcium and serum phosphorus in the
OVX-GEN-Si group were higher than those in the OVX-GEN and OVX-Si group
(P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). At the same time, the treatment with genistein and/or silicon
decreased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin, which were increased 
by ovariectomy; serum ALP and osteocalcin in the OVX-GEN-Si group were lower than
those in the OVX-GEN and OVX-Si groups (P&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05). The results above indicate
that genistein and silicon have synergistic effects on bone formation in
ovariectomized rats.

AIM: Consumption of isoflavones, which are predominantly derived from soybeans,
reduces the risk of estrogen-related diseases, such as menopausal symptoms,
breast cancer, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Equol is more
bioavailable than other soy isoflavones, and equol producers are believed to
benefit to a greater extent. This study was conducted to evaluate the relation
between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and equol-production status in Japanese
reproductive-age women.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study. The study included 144 
Japanese women aged 20-45 years. PMS patients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;46) were recruited at three
obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Control group women (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;98) who were not
receiving therapy for PMS were recruited from the local area by advertisement.
The participants' equol-production status was determined using urine samples
collected after a soy challenge test.
RESULTS: The prevalence of equol producers was 41.8% in the control group and
23.9% in the patient group (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.042). Using univariate analysis, significant
risk factors for equol non-producers were being a PMS patient and being younger. 
In multivariate analysis with a step-wise model, being a PMS patient (odds ratio,
2.342; 95% confidence interval, 1.021-5.698) was shown to be a significant risk
factor for being an equol non-producer.
CONCLUSION: This study showed a relation between PMS and equol-production status 
in Japanese women.

Recent findings indicate that mRNA splicing inhibitors can be potential
anticancer candidates. We have previously established a screening system which
monitors mRNA processing in order to identify mRNA processing inhibitors. Among a
number of dietary resources, isoflavone fractions showed an inhibitory effect of 
mRNA processing. These findings demonstrate that a variety of dietary sources
have an impact on mRNA biogenesis.

There is increasing concern about possible adverse effects of soy based infant
formulas (SBIF) due to their high amount of isoflavones (ISO). The aim of the
present study was to investigate effects of neonatal exposure to ISO on
reproductive system of female Wistar rats. Animals were exposed to an ISO
depleted diet or a diet enriched with an ISO extract (IRD; 508mg ISO/kg) during
embryogenesis and adolescence. Pups of each group were fed daily by pipette with 
ISO-suspension (ISO+; 32mg ISO/kg bw) or placebo from postnatal day (PND) 1 until
PND23 resulting in plasma concentrations similar to levels reported in infants
fed SBIF. The visceral fat mass was reduced by long-term IRD. Vaginal epithelial 
height was increased at PND23 and vaginal opening was precocious in ISO+ groups. 
Later in life, more often irregular estrus cycles were observed in rats of ISO+
groups. In addition, FSH levels and uterine epithelial heights were increased at 
PND80 in ISO+ groups. In summary, the results indicate that neonatal ISO intake, 
resulting in plasma concentrations achievable through SBIF, has an estrogenic
effect on prepubertal rats and influences female reproductive tract later in
life.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The estrogenic effects of genistein, as reconfirmed by the
American National Toxicology Program (USA-NTP), have led to several new clinical 
studies being undertaken. Here, we highlight the most relevant recent data,
reporting either beneficial or adverse effects.
RECENT FINDINGS: Phytoestrogens are natural molecules from edible plants
exhibiting estrogenic activities. Post-USA-NTP studies investigated both human
and animal reproductive and other physiological issues. These studies showed that
estrogens can be either deleterious for reproduction and estrogen-dependent
diseases, or beneficial for those with steroid deficiencies, that is more than
50. The specific outcome depends on exposure level and on the estrogenic status
of the patients exposed. Recently, it was reported that, with the
industrialization of soybean process, phytoestrogen exposure dramatically
increased in both humans and cattle, whereas traditional Asian
soy-food-processing empirically removed isoflavones. Phytoestrogen exposure has
also become more widespread with the progressive internationalization of soybean 
use in human and cattle food.
SUMMARY: Phytoestrogens should be considered as modern endocrine disruptors and
studied as such.

OBJECTIVE: Several observational studies and trials examined the relationship
between isoflavones or soybeans and depressive symptoms among peri- and
postmenopausal women. We cross-sectionally evaluated the associations between
intake of soy products and isoflavones and depressive symptoms during pregnancy
in Japan.
METHODS: Study subjects were 1745 pregnant women. Dietary intake during the
preceding month was assessed using a self-administered diet history
questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were defined by a score of 16 or over in the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Higher intake of total soy products, tofu, tofu products, fermented
soybeans, boiled soybeans, miso soup, and isoflavones was independently related
to a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy: The adjusted
prevalence ratios (95&nbsp;% confidence intervals, P for trend) between extreme
quartiles were 0.63 (0.47-0.85, 0.002), 0.72 (0.54-0.96, 0.007), 0.74 (0.56-0.98,
0.04), 0.57 (0.42-0.76, &lt;0.0001), 0.73 (0.55-0.98, 0.03), 0.65 (0.49-0.87,
0.003), and 0.63 (0.46-0.86, 0.002), respectively. A significant positive
exposure-response relationship was found between miso intake and depressive
symptoms during pregnancy. No material relationship was observed between soymilk 
intake and depressive symptoms during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show independent inverse relationships
between intake of total soy products, tofu, tofu products, fermented soybeans,
boiled soybeans, miso soup, and isoflavones and depressive symptoms during
pregnancy.

Genistein and daidzein are the main isoflavones in soy. Their potential
beneficial or adverse effects in males like the prevention of prostate cancer or 
the impact on reproductive functions are controversially discussed. Major
determinants of their bioactivity are the absorption and biotransformation of
isoflavones. In this study, we focused on the influence of testosterone on plasma
availability and phase II metabolism of isoflavones. Male Wistar rats, receiving 
an isoflavones rich diet, were randomized into three groups: Two groups were
orchiectomized (ORX) at postnatal day (PND) 80 and treated for 11&nbsp;days with
testosterone propionate (TP) (ORX TP group) or a vehicle (ORX group) after a
7&nbsp;days lasting hormonal decline. The third group served as control and remained
intact. Rats were sacrificed at PND 98. ORX rats had reduced isoflavones plasma
levels. Differently regulated mRNA expressions of transporters relevant for
transport of phase II metabolites in liver and kidney may be responsible for this
reduction, more precisely Slc10a1 and Slc21a1 in kidney as well as Slc22a8 in
liver. While main phase II metabolites in intact rats were disulfates and
sulfoglucuronides, the amount of sulfate conjugates was significantly diminished 
by ORX. In accordance with that, mRNA expression of different sulfotransferases
was reduced in liver by ORX. The observed effects could be almost restored by TP 
treatment. In conclusion, testosterone, and likely further androgens, has a huge 
impact on phase II metabolism and availability of isoflavones by influencing the 
expression of different sulfotransferases and transporters.

Nutritional status during intrauterine and early postnatal life impacts the risk 
of chronic diseases; however, evidence for an association between early-life
dietary factors and bone health in adults is limited. Soy protein isolate (SPI)
may be one such dietary factor that promotes bone accretion during early life
with persistent effects into adulthood. In the present study, we fed postnatal
day (PND) 24 weanling female rats an SPI diet for 30 d [short-term SPI (ST-SPI)],
and on PND 55, we switched SPI diet to control Cas diet until age 6 mo. Rats then
underwent either ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgery and thereafter either
continued to be fed an SPI diet or control diet for 1 or 3 wk. We showed
significantly increased bone mass in 30-d SPI-fed young rats compared with
controls. OVX-induced bone loss was associated with increased osteoblastic cell
senescence. On the one hand, both long-term SPI (continuous SPI diet throughout
life) and ST-SPI diet only in early life protected against 1 wk
post-OVX-associated bone loss. On the other hand, long-term SPI diet diminished
the loss of total, trabecular, and cortical bone mineral density, whereas ST-SPI 
diet only reduced cortical bone mineral density loss 3 wk post-OVX. Persistent
and protective effects of SPI diets on OVX-induced bone loss were associated with
down-regulation of the caveolin-1/p53-mediated senescence pathway in bone. We
recapitulated these results in cell cultures. Reprogramming of cellular
senescence signaling by SPI-associated isoflavones in osteoblastic cells may
explain the persistent effects of SPI on bone. These results suggest that
OVX-induced bone loss, in part, is a result of increased osteoblastic cell
senescence, and that ST-SPI diet early in life has modest but persistent
programming effects on bone formation to prevent OVX-induced bone loss in adult
female rats.-Chen, J.-R., Lazarenko, O. P., Blackburn, M. L., Shankar, K. Dietary
factors during early life program bone formation in female rats.

INTRODUCTION: Menopause is associated with increased bone resorption and
decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Phytoestrogens are believed to prevent bone
loss. This study reviewed relevant randomized, controlled trials to determine the
effects of phytoestrogens on BMD in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: In order to perform this systematic review, PubMed, Science Direct,
Scopus, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Knowledge, and ProQuest databases were
searched for articles published during 2005-2016. The main keywords used during
the searches were "phytoestrogen" and "bone mineral density" and "menopause". The
Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the quality of the
selected studies and to assess the risk of bias.
RESULTS: A total of 23 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. 
Most selected studies used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. In total,
3494 participants were enrolled in the selected trials. Different types of soy
isoflavone extracts, including genistein extracts (either alone or in combination
with daidzein), dietary products containing different amounts of phytoestrogens, 
and red clover extracts were used in the designed interventions. The duration of 
the interventions ranged from 7 weeks to 3 years. In most studies, the primary
outcome was the efficacy of the designed intervention which was assessed through 
measuring whole body or regional BMD or bone mineral content, T-scores, and
biomarkers of bone metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Isoflavones probably have beneficial effects on bone health in
menopausal women. Nevertheless, there were controversial reports about changes in
BMD. Supplementation with a phytoestrogen can probably prevent the reduction in
BMD and maintain a healthy bone structure during menopause.

In this study, the roles of ABA-cADPR-Ca2+ and ABA-IP3-Ca2+ signaling pathways in
UV-B-induced isoflavone accumulation in soybean sprouts were investigated.
Results showed that abscisic acid (ABA) up regulated cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)
and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) levels in soybean sprouts under UV-B
radiation. Furthermore, cADPR and IP3, as second messengers of UV-B-triggered
ABA, induced isoflavone accumulation by up-regulating proteins and genes
expression and activity of isoflavone biosynthetic-enzymes (chalcone synthase,
CHS; isoflavone synthase, IFS). After Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, isoflavone
content decreased. Overall, ABA-induced cADPR and IP3 up regulated isoflavone
accumulation which was mediated by Ca2+ signaling via enhancing the expression of
proteins and genes participating in isoflavone biosynthesis in soybean sprouts
under UV-B radiation.

The potential of intrinsic fluorescence and principal component analysis (PCA) to
characterize the antioxidant capacity of soy protein hydrolysates (SPH) during
sequential ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) was evaluated. SPH was
obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of soy protein isolate. Antioxidant capacity was
measured by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) and Folin Ciocalteau
Reagent (FCR) assays together with fluorescence excitation-emission matrices
(EEM). PCA of the fluorescence EEMs revealed two principal components
(PC1-tryptophan, PC2-tyrosine) that captured significant variance in the
fluorescence spectra. Regression models between antioxidant capacity and PC1 and 
PC2 displayed strong linear correlations for NF fractions and a weak linear
correlation for UF fractions. Clustering of UF and NF fractions according to
ORACFPCA and FCRFPCA was observed. The ability of this method to extract
information on contributions by tryptophan and tyrosine amino acid residues to
the antioxidant capacity of SPH fractions was demonstrated.

We investigated the metabolite profile of soybean sprouts at 0, 1, 2, 3, and
4days after germination using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and
liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) to understand the relationship between
germination and nutritional quality. Data were analyzed by partial least
squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and sprout samples were separated
successfully using their PLS-DA scores. Fifty-eight metabolites, including
macromolecular derivatives related to energy production, amino acids,
myo-inositol metabolites, phytosterols, antioxidants, isoflavones, and
soyasaponins, contributed to the separation. Amino acids, myo-inositol
metabolites, isoflavone aglycones, B soyasaponins, antioxidants, and
phytosterols, associated with health benefits and/or taste quality, increased
with germination time while isoflavone glycosides and DDMP soyasaponins
decreased. Based on these metabolites, the metabolomic pathway associated with
energy production in soybean sprouts is suggested. Our data suggest that
sprouting is a useful processing step to improve soybean nutritional quality, and
metabolomic analysis is useful in understanding nutritional change during
sprouting.

To test the hypothesis that the plant stress related elicitor cis-jasmone (cJ)
provides protection in soybean pods against the seed-sucking stink bug pest,
Euschistus heros, the growth of E.&nbsp;heros on cJ-treated pods was investigated
using three soybean cultivars differing in insect susceptibility, i.e. BRS 134
(susceptible), IAC 100 (resistant) and Dowling (resistant). E.&nbsp;heros showed
reduced weight gain when fed cJ-treated Dowling, whereas no effect on weight gain
was observed when fed other treated cultivars. Using analysis of variance, a
three factor (cultivar x treatment x time) interaction was observed with
concentrations of the flavonoid glycosides daidzin and genistin, and their
corresponding aglycones, daidzein and genistein. There were increases in
genistein and genistin concentrations in cJ-treated Dowling at 144 and 120&nbsp;h post
treatment, respectively. Higher concentrations of malonyldaidzin and
malonylgenistin in Dowling, compared to BRS 134 and IAC 100, were observed
independently of time, the highest concentrations being observed in cJ-treated
seeds. Levels of glycitin and malonylglycitin were higher in BRS 134 and IAC 100 
compared to Dowling. Canonical variate analysis indicated daidzein (in the first 
two canonical variates) and genistein (in the first only) as important
discriminatory variables. These results suggest that cJ treatment leads to an
increase in the levels of potentially defensive isoflavonoids in immature soybean
seeds, but the negative effect upon E.&nbsp;heros performance is cultivar-dependent.

Soy isoflavones exert beneficial health effects; however, their potential to
ameliorate conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been 
studied in detail. In vitro and in vivo models were used to determine the effect 
of isoflavones on lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In nude
mice, consumption of Novasoy (NS) increased cholesterol and lipid metabolism gene
expression, including Scd-1 (27.7-fold), Cyp4a14 (35.2-fold), and Cyp4a10
(9.5-fold), and reduced anti-inflammatory genes, including Cebpd (16.4-fold). A
high-fat (HF) diet containing 0.4% (w/w) NS for 10 weeks significantly reduced
percent weight gain (74.6 ± 2.5 vs 68.6 ± 3.5%) and hepatic lipid accumulation
(20 ± 1.2 vs 27 ± 1.5%), compared to HF alone (p &lt; 0.05) in C57BL/6J mice. NS
also increased lipid oxidation and antioxidant gene expression while decreasing
inflammatory cytokines. In vitro analysis in HepG2 cells revealed that genistein 
dose-dependently decreases oleic acid-induced lipid accumulation. Soy isoflavones
may ameliorate symptoms associated with MetS via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
and hypolipidemic modulation.

Dietary isoflavones, daidzein and genistein are of huge interest in the
nutraceutical field due to their practical application to postmenopause
complications. This study is the first report an efficient method to prepare
isoflavone rich soybean leaves (soyleaves) which is an edible food stuff in Asian
countries. The preharvest treatment of ethylene highly stimulated the level of
isoflavone in soyleaves. Annotation and quantification of metabolites were
determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and HPLC. Phenolic metabolites of soyleaves are
mostly kaempferol glycosides, but not dietary isoflavones. The accumulated
isoflavones by ethylene treatment were determined to be daidzin 1, genistin 2,
malonyldaidzin 3 and malonylgenistin 4, which were easily hydrolyzed to daidzein 
and genistein by β-glucosidase. Total content of dietary isoflavones was
increased up to 13854 μg/g. The most suitable condition was estimated to be 250
μg/g ethylene or 200 μg/g ethephon (ethylene donor) treatment at the R3 growth
stage. The ratio of daidzein and genistein glycosides was approximately 5 to 3.
The accumulated isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes were identified within
the transcriptome of soyleaves tissues at 1 day after treatment of ethephon. The 
quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these genes indicated significantly higher
expression of CHS, CHI, IFS, HID, IF7GT, and IF7MaT compared to control leaves.
These findings suggest that ethylene activates a set of structural genes involved
in isoflavonoid biosynthesis, thereby leading to enhanced production of
isoflavones in soybean plants.

Genistein is a soybean isoflavone; in its aglycone it has various biological
activities. Animal experiments, clinical studies and epidemiological
investigations suggest that genistein has preventative and curative functions for
a number of diseases, particularly in cancer. The present study explored the
potential anti-cancer effect of genistein by observing its role in inhibiting
A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation and investigating the possible
mechanism. A549 cells were exposed to various concentrations of genistein (0, 10,
25, 50, 100 and 200 µM; dissolved in physiological saline) for 1, 2 and 3 days.
Subsequently, the viability of A549 cells was determined by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, cell
apoptosis was examined using a flow cytometer, caspase 3/9 activity was measured 
using commercial kits, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction was used to analyze the miR-27a expression and western blotting was used
to investigate MET protein expression. The results suggested a significant
inhibition of A549 cell growth following treatment with genistein in a time- and 
dose-dependent manner. The current study also indicated that treatment with
genistein significantly induces cell apoptosis and promotes caspase-3/9
activation of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further functional assays
revealed that the anti-cancer effect of genistein activated microRNA-27a
(miR-27a) expression levels and reduced MET protein expression in A549 cells. In 
conclusion, the present study demonstrates that genistein inhibits A549 human
lung cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, this study reports, for the first
time, a correlation between the anti-cancer effect of genistein and
miR-27a-mediated MET signaling.

Despite substantial research, the understanding of the chemopreventive mechanisms
of soy isoflavones remains challenging. Promising tools, such as metabolomics,
can provide now a deeper insight into their biochemical mechanisms. The purpose
of this study was to offer a comprehensive assessment of the metabolic
alterations induced by genistein, daidzein and a soy seed extract on estrogen
responsive (MCF-7) and estrogen non-responsive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), 
using a global metabolomic approach. The
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay showed
that all test compounds induced a biphasic effect on MCF-7 cells and only a
dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (¹H-NMR) profiling of extracellular metabolites and gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) profiling of intracellular metabolites
confirmed that all test compounds shared similar metabolic mechanisms. Exposing
MCF-7 cells to stimulatory concentrations of isoflavones led to increased
intracellular levels of 6-phosphogluconate and ribose 5-phosphate, suggesting a
possible upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway. After exposure to
inhibitory doses of isoflavones, a significant decrease in glucose uptake was
observed, especially for MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, the glutamine uptake
was significantly restricted, leading to alterations in protein biosynthesis.
Understanding the metabolomic alterations of isoflavones represents a step
forward in considering soy and soy derivates as functional foods in breast cancer
chemoprevention.

Inflammaging is the chronic low-grade inflammatory state present in the elderly, 
characterized by increased systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines. 
It has been shown that inflammaging increases the risk of pathologic conditions
and age-related diseases, and that it also has been associated with increased
skeletal muscle wasting, strength loss, and functional impairments. Experimental 
evidence suggests that the increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines 
and primary tumor necrosis factor α observed in chronic inflammation lead to
protein degradation through proteasome activation and reduced skeletal muscle
protein synthesis (MPS) via protein kinase B/Akt downregulation. Dairy and soy
proteins contain all the essential amino acids, demonstrate sufficient absorption
kinetics, and include other bioactive peptides that may offer nutritional
benefits, in addition to those of stimulating MPS. Whey protein has antioxidative
effects, primarily because of its ability to enhance the availability of reduced 
glutathione and the activity of the endogenous antioxidative enzyme system. Soy
protein and isoflavone-enriched soy protein, meanwhile, may counteract chronic
inflammation through regulation of the nuclear transcription factor κB signaling 
pathway and cytokine production. Although evidence suggests that whey protein,
soy protein, and isoflavone-enriched soy proteins may be promising nutritional
interventions against the oxidative stress and chronic inflammation present in
pathologic conditions and aging (inflammaging), there is a lack of information
about the anabolic potential of dietary protein intake and protein
supplementation in elderly people with increased systemic inflammation. The
antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as the anabolic potential of
protein supplementation, should be further investigated in the future with
well-designed clinical trials focusing on inflammaging and its associated
skeletal muscle loss.

Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether isoflavones affect
depressive symptoms in women.
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted to identify clinical and
epidemiologic studies that evaluated the impact of soy intake and isoflavone
exposure on depressive symptoms. References from identified studies were also
evaluated to identify eligible studies.
RESULTS: Only limited epidemiologic research has evaluated the impact of soy or
isoflavone intake on depression although several studies from China and Japan did
find soy product intake was inversely related to risk of depression. Often times,
soy was, however, evaluated only as a component of a summative dietary pattern
(eg, a "Japanese" or "Healthy" diet). Of the 20 intervention studies identified, 
roughly half found statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms in
response to isoflavones although several had design weakness. Of those studies
reporting a lack of antidepressant effects of isoflavones, design limitations
likely contributed to the lack of efficacy. In all but two trials, assessment of 
depression was, however, a secondary outcome. It is notable that both trials in
which depression was a primary outcome found isoflavones significantly improved
symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the data are inconsistent and limited, the clinical and
epidemiologic evidence suggests that isoflavones may offer a safe, well-tolerated
option for management of depression. Furthermore, the intervention doses used in 
the clinical studies fall well within the dietary range. The extant literature
reveals key design features for future studies, which based upon the results of
this review, are clearly warranted.

BACKGROUND: Early-life exposure to estrogenic compounds affects the development
of the reproductive system in rodent models and humans. Soy products, which
contain phytoestrogens such as genistein, are one source of exposure in infants
fed soy formula, and they result in high serum concentrations.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine whether soy exposure is associated with
differential DNA methylation in vaginal cells from soy-fed infant girls.
METHODS: Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, we evaluated
epigenome-wide DNA methylation in vaginal cells from four soy formula-fed and six
cow formula-fed girls from the Infant Feeding and Early Development (IFED) study.
Using pyrosequencing we followed up the two most differentially methylated sites 
in 214 vaginal cell samples serially collected between birth and 9 months of age 
from 50 girls (28 soy formula-fed and 22 cow formula-fed). With a mouse model, we
examined the effect of neonatal exposure to genistein on gene specific mRNA
levels in vaginal tissue.
RESULTS: The epigenome-wide scan suggested differences in methylation between soy
formula-fed and cow formula-fed infants at three CpGs in the gene proline rich 5 
like (PRR5L) (p &lt; 104). Pyrosequencing of the two feeding groups found that
methylation levels progressively diverged with age, with pointwise differences
becoming statistically significant after 126 days. Genistein-exposed mice showed 
a 50% decrease in vaginal Prr5l mRNA levels compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Girls fed soy formula have altered DNA methylation in vaginal cell
DNA which may be associated with decreased expression of an estrogen-responsive
gene. Citation: Harlid S, Adgent M, Jefferson WN, Panduri V, Umbach DM, Xu Z,

The distribution and variation of targeted metabolites in soybean seeds are
affected by genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we used 192 soybean
germplasm accessions collected from two provinces of Korea to elucidate the
effects of seed coat color and seeds dry weight on the metabolic variation and
responses of targeted metabolites. The effects of seed coat color and seeds dry
weight were present in sucrose, total oligosaccharides, total carbohydrates and
all measured fatty acids. The targeted metabolites were clustered within three
groups. These metabolites were not only differently related to seeds dry weight, 
but also responded differentially to seed coat color. The inter-relationship
between the targeted metabolites was highly present in the result of correlation 
analysis. Overall, results revealed that the targeted metabolites were diverged
in relation to seed coat color and seeds dry weight within locally collected
soybean seed germplasm accessions.

A Doehlert experimental design was conducted and surface response methodology was
used to determine the effect of temperature, contact time and solid liquid ratio 
on isoflavone extraction from soybean flour or Soybean Protein Isolate in
pressurized water system. The optimal conditions conducted gave an extraction
yield of 85% from soybean flour. For Soybean Protein Isolate compared to soybean 
flour, the isoflavone extraction yield is 61%. This difference could be explained
by higher aglycon content, while aglycon appears to be the least extracted
isoflavone by pressurized water. The solid liquid ratio in the ASE cell was the
overriding factor in obtaining high yields with both soybean products, while
temperature has less influence. A high temperature causes conversion of the
malonyls-glucosides and glucosides isoflavone derivatives into glucosides or
aglycons forms. pressurized water extraction showed a high solubilization of
protein material up to 95% of inserted Soybean Protein Isolate.

CONTEXT: Limited data are available evaluating the effects of soy isoflavones on 
metabolic status of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
OBJECTIVE: The current study was performed to determine the effects of soy
isoflavones on metabolic status of patients with PCOS.
METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on
70 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria who were 18-40
years old. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 50
mg/d soy isoflavones (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) for 12 weeks. Metabolic,
endocrine, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers were quantified at the
beginning of the study and after the 12-week intervention.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the placebo group, soy
isoflavone administration significantly decreased circulating serum levels of
insulin (-1.2 ± 4.0 vs +2.8 ± 4.7 μIU/mL; P &lt; .001) and homeostasis model of
assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-0.3 ± 1.0 vs +0.6 ± 1.1; P &lt; .001) and 
increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.0009 ± 0.01 vs
-0.01 ± 0.03; P = .01). Supplementation with soy isoflavones resulted in
significant reductions in free androgen index (-0.03 ± 0.04 vs +0.02 ± 0.03; P &lt; 
.001) and serum triglycerides (-13.3 ± 62.2 vs +10.3 ± 24.5 mg/dL; P = .04)
compared to the placebo group. There was a significant increase in plasma total
glutathione (+96.0 ± 102.2 vs +22.7 ± 157.8 μmol/L; P = .04) and a significant
decrease in malondialdehyde levels (-0.7 ± 0.8 vs +0.8 ± 2.3 μmol/L; P = .001) by
soy isoflavone intake compared with the placebo group. We did not observe any
significant effect of soy isoflavone intake on other lipid profiles and
inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.
CONCLUSION: Soy isoflavone administration for 12 weeks in women with PCOS
significantly improved markers of insulin resistance, hormonal status,
triglycerides, and biomarkers of oxidative stress.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The substantial characteristics of Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
(IBS) are associated with estrogens in women. Both soy isoflavones and vitamin D 
can modulate estrogen receptors in the colonic smooth muscles. The aim of this
study was to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones, vitamin D and their
probable interactions in women with IBS.
METHODS: In a factorial blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 women with IBS
(age:18-75yr, were randomly assigned in 4 arms to receive either placebo of
vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (P+P), or placebo of vitamin D and soy
isoflavones (P+S), or vitamin D and placebo of soy isoflavones (D+P), or vitamin 
D and soy isoflavones (D+S) for 6 weeks. Dosage of soy isoflavone was 2 capsules 
of 20 mg soy isoflavones per day, and dosage of vitamin D was one pearl of 50'000
IU biweekly. The clinical outcomes were IBS symptoms severity scores (IBS-SSS),
disease- specific quality of life (IBS-QOL) and total score (IBS-TS) that
evaluated at weeks 0, 6, and 10, and compared to each other.
RESULTS: IBS-TS improved significantly in both S+P and D+P groups (p- value =
0.004, 0.015). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones and vitamin D on IBS-TS 
was significant (p&lt;0.05). The interaction effect of soy isoflavones with vitamin 
D and the main effect of vitamin D on IBS-SSS were not statistically significant,
whereas IBS-SSS decreased significantly in S+P and D+P groups (p-value = 0.001,
0.047 respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that co-administration of soy isoflavones with
vitamin D did not improve the IBS- SSS and IBS- QOL; however, it improved the
IBS-TS.

In the rhizobia-legume symbiotic interaction, bacterial surface polysaccharides, 
such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), K-antigen
polysaccharide (KPS) or cyclic glucans (CG), appear to play crucial roles either 
acting as signals required for the progression of the interaction and/or
preventing host defence mechanisms. The symbiotic significance of each of these
polysaccharides varies depending on the specific rhizobia-legume couple. In this 
work we show that the production of exopolysaccharide by Sinorhizobium fredii
HH103, but not by other S. fredii strains such as USDA257 or NGR234, is repressed
by nod gene inducing flavonoids such as genistein and that this repression is
dependent on the presence of a functional NodD1 protein. In agreement with the
importance of EPS for bacterial biofilms, this reduced EPS production upon
treatment with flavonoids correlates with decreased biofilm formation ability. By
using quantitative RT-PCR analysis we show that expression of the exoY2 and exoK 
genes is repressed in late stationary cultures of S. fredii HH103 upon treatment 
with genistein. Results presented in this work show that in S. fredii HH103 EPS
production is regulated just in the opposite way than other bacterial signals
such as Nod factors and type 3 secreted effectors: it is repressed by flavonoids 
and NodD1 and enhanced by the nod repressor NolR. These results are in agreement 
with our previous observations showing that lack of EPS production by S. fredii
HH103 is not only non-detrimental but even beneficial for symbiosis with soybean.

Erlotinib (Tarceva®) is a chemotherapeutic drug approved for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Its primary mode of action is
the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK). Recently, RTK-inhibiting polyphenols have been reported to
interact synergistically with erlotinib. Furthermore some anthocyanidins and
anthocyanin-rich berry extracts have been reported to inhibit tyrosine kinases,
including the EGFR, which raises the question of potential interactions with
erlotinib. Polyphenol-rich preparations such as berry- or soy-based products are 
commercially available as food supplements. In the present study we tested a
bilberry extract, its major anthocyanin and potential intestinal degradation
products, as well as genistein, with respect to possible interactions with
erlotinib. Cell growth inhibition was assessed using the sulforhodamine B assay, 
while interactions with EGFR phosphorylation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/western
blotting with subsequent immunodetection. Genistein, bilberry extract,
delphinidin-3-O-glucoside and delphinidin were found to antagonize erlotinib
whereas phloroglucinol aldehyde was found to enhance cytostatic effects of the
drug on human epithelial A431 cells. Genistein also antagonized the EGFR
inhibitory effects of erlotinib, whereas bilberry anthocyanins showed no
significant interactions in this regard. Our data indicate that different
polyphenols are potentially able to impair the cytostatic effect of erlotinib in 
vitro. Genistein interacts via the modulation of erlotinib-mediated EGFR
inhibition whereas bilberry anthocyanins modulated the growth-inhibitory effect
of erlotinib without affecting EGFR phosphorylation, thus indicating a different 
mechanism of interference.

Soybean acid hydrolyzed extracts are raw-materials widely used for manufacturing 
of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics products due to their high content of isoflavone
aglycones. In the present study, the main sugar degradation products
5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural (EMF) were
quantitatively determined after acid hydrolysis of extracts from different
soybean cultivars by a validated liquid chromatography method. The furanic
compounds determined in samples cover the range of 0.16-0.21mg/mL and
0.22-0.33mg/mL for HMF and EMF, respectively. Complementarily, due to the scarce 
literature regarding the EMF toxicology, this study also assessed the EMF
mutagenicity by the Salmonella/microsome test and genotoxicity by the comet
assay. The results revealed that EMF did not show mutagenicity at the range of
50-5000μg/plate in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA97a, TA100, TA102 and TA1535,
but induced DNA damage in HepG2 cells at non-cytotoxic doses of 0.1-1.3mg/mL,
mainly by oxidative stress mechanisms. Based on literature of HMF genotoxicity,
and considering the EMF genotoxicity results herein shown, purification
procedures to remove these impurities from extracts are recommended during
healthcare products development to ensure the security of the products.

OBJECTIVE: Genistein, a major isoflavone found in soybeans, exhibits anti-cancer 
activity. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is known to be implicated in
apoptosis induced by anti-cancer drugs. This study aimed to characterize the role
of ER stress in genistein-induced apoptosis in cervical cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cells were treated with genistein or/and
4-phenylbutyric acid. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay
and flow cytometry. Protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Genistein suppressed the viability of HeLa cells in a dose dependent
manner. In addition, genistein caused apoptosis in HeLa cells in a dose dependent
manner. Genistein triggered ER stress in HeLa cells, as indicated by the
upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CHOP expression.
Furthermore, ER stress&nbsp;inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid alleviated
genistein-induced apoptosis and ER stress in HeLa cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ER stress contributes to genistein-induced 
apoptosis in cervical cancer cells, and genistein is a promising agent for
cervical cancer therapy.

Menopausal estrogen loss leads to an increased bone loss. Soy isoflavones can act
as selective estrogen receptor modulators, their role in bone turnover is
unclear. The primary outcome was assessing changes in plasma bone turnover
markers. The secondary outcomes were assessing changes in cardiovascular risk
markers including insulin resistance, blood pressure, and lipid profile. We
performed a double-blind randomized parallel study in which 200 women within 2
years after the onset of their menopause were randomized to 15 g soy protein with
66 mg isoflavone (SPI) or 15 g soy protein alone (SP), daily for 6 months. There 
was a significant reduction in type I collagen crosslinked beta C-telopeptide
(βCTX) (bone-resorption marker) with SPI supplementation (0.40 ± 0.17 versus
0.15 ± 0.09 μg/L; p &lt; 0.01) compared to SP supplementation (0.35 ± 0.12 versus
0.35 ± 0.13 μg/L; p = 0.92) after 6 months. There was also a significant
reduction in type I procollagen-N-propeptide (P1NP) (bone formation marker) with 
SPI supplementation (50.5 ± 25.0 versus 34.3 ± 17.6 μg/L; p &lt; 0.01), more marked 
between 3 and 6 months. Following SPI there was a significant reduction in
fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, and systolic blood pressure
whereas no significant changes in these parameters was observed with SP. There
were no significant changes in fasting lipid profile and diastolic blood pressure
with either preparation. There was a significant increase in TSH and reduction in
free thyroxine (p &lt; 0.01) with SPI supplementation though free tri-iodothyronine 
was unchanged. In conclusion, soy protein with isoflavones may confer a
beneficial effect on bone health, analogous to the mode of action of
antiresorptive agents, albeit to a less magnitude. There was a significant
improvement of cardiovascular risk markers, but a significant increase in TSH and
reduction in free thyroxine after SPI supplementation indicating a detrimental
effect on thyroid function. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Polyploidy is prevalent in nature. As the fate of duplicated genes becomes more
complicated when the encoded proteins function as oligomers, functional
investigations into duplicated oligomer-encoding genes in polyploid genomes will 
facilitate our understanding of how traits are expressed. In this study, we
identified GmCHLI1, a gene encoding the I subunit of magnesium (Mg)-chelatase,
which functions in hexamers as responsible for the semi-dominant etiolation
phenotype in soybean. Four GmCHLI copies derived from two polyploidy events were 
identified in the soybean genome. Further investigation with regard to expression
patterns indicated that these four copies have diverged into two pairs; mutation 
in the other copy of the pair that includes GmCHLI1 also resulted in a
chlorophyll-deficient phenotype. Protein interaction assays showed that these
four GmCHLIs can interact with each other, but stronger interactions were found
with mutated subunits. The results indicate that, in polyploidy, deficiency in
each copy of duplicated oligomer-encoding genes could result in a mutant
phenotype due to hetero-oligomer formation, which is different from the model of 
allelic dosage or functional redundancy. In addition, we interestingly found an
increase in isoflavonoids in the heterozygous etiolated plants, which might be
useful for improving soybean seed quality.

In this work, an integration of solid-liquid and liquid-liquid extractions by
using aqueous micellar two-phase systems was evaluated as potential tool to
purify soy isoflavones. Additionally, the proposed methodology aimed to preserve 
the protein content of the processed soy flour. The extractive assays were
performed in AMTPS formed by Triton X-114 and sodium tartrate. In order to
optimize the purification process, temperature and time were evaluated as
independent variables. Under optimal working conditions, i.e. 100min and 33°C of 
incubation, IF were purified with a recovery percentage of 93 and a purification 
factor of almost 10. More importantly, the obtained sample presented an aglycone 
proportion superior to the reported by other methodologies. These results open
perspectives to the use of aqueous micellar two-phase systems as an integrative
methodology to extract, concentrate and purify isoflavones.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis affecting children. Incidence of KD 
varies according to ethnicity and is highest in Asian populations. Although
genetic differences may explain this variation, dietary or environmental factors 
could also be responsible. The objectives of this study were to determine dietary
soy and isoflavone consumption in a cohort of KD children just before disease
onset and their mothers' intake during pregnancy and nursing. We tested the
hypothesis that soy isoflavone consumption is associated with risk of KD in US
children, potentially explaining some of the ethnic-cultural variation in
incidence. We evaluated soy food intake and isoflavone consumption in nearly 200 
US KD cases and 200 age-matched controls using a food frequency questionnaire for
children and in their mothers. We used a logistic regression model to test the
association of isoflavones and KD. Maternal surveys on soy intake during
pregnancy and nursing showed no significant differences in isoflavone consumption
between groups. However, we identified significantly increased KD risk in
children for total isoflavone (odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.37-3.96) and genistein (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.46-4.16) intakes, when
comparing high soy consumers vs nonconsumers. In addition, significantly
increased KD risk occurred in Asian-American children with the highest
consumption (total isoflavones: OR, 7.29; 95% CI, 1.73-30.75; genistein: OR,
8.33; 95% CI, 1.92-36.24) compared to whites. These findings indicate that
childhood dietary isoflavone consumption, but not maternal isoflavone intake
during pregnancy and nursing, relates to KD risk in an ethnically diverse US
population.

Effects of soy containing diet and isoflavones on cytochrome P450 enzyme
expression and activity.

Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) play an important role in metabolism and clearance of
most clinically utilized drugs and other xenobiotics. They are important in
metabolism of endogenous compounds including fatty acids, sterols, steroids and
lipid-soluble vitamins. Dietary factors such as phytochemicals are capable of
affecting CYP expression and activity, which may be important in diet-drug
interactions and in the development of fatty liver disease, cardiovascular
disease and cancer. One important diet-CYP interaction is with diets containing
plant proteins, particularly soy protein. Soy diets are traditionally consumed in
Asian countries and are linked to lower incidence of several cancers and of
cardiovascular disease in Asian populations. Soy is also an important protein
source in vegetarian and vegan diets and the sole protein source in soy infant
formulas. Recent studies suggest that consumption of soy can inhibit induction of
CY1 enzymes by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which may contribute to
cancer prevention. In addition, there are data to suggest that soy components
promiscuously activate several nuclear receptors including PXR, PPAR and LXR
resulting in increased expression of CYP3As, CYP4As and CYPs involved in
metabolism of cholesterol to bile acids. Such soy-CYP interactions may alter drug
pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy and are associated with improved lipid 
homeostasis and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The current review
summarizes results from in vitro; in vivo and clinical studies of soy-CYP
interactions and examines the evidence linking the effects of soy diets on CYP
expression to isoflavone phytoestrogens, particularly, genistein and daidzein
that are associated with soy protein.

Coumestrol is the one of the major phytoestrogens which is abundant in soybeans, 
legumes, brussel sprouts, and spinach. The beneficial effects of coumestrol are
well known in various biological processes including; neuroprotective effects on 
the nervous system, function of the female reproductive system, anti-bacterial
properties, and anti-cancer effects. Although the anti-tumor activity of
coumestrol has been demonstrated for ovarian, breast, lung, and cervical cancers,
little is known of its effects on prostate cancer. Therefore, in the present
study, we investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of coumestrol on two prostate
cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP. Our results showed that coumestrol decreased
proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis in both PC3 and LNCaP cells.
Moreover, effects of coumestrol on cell signaling pathways were investigated and 
it increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, P90RSK, and P53 proteins in a dose- 
and time-dependent manner whereas phosphorylation of AKT was reduced by
coumestrol under the same conditions for culture of PC3 and LNCaP cells. In
addition, mitochondrial dysfunction was induced by coumestrol as evidenced by a
significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, cleavage of
caspase-3 and caspase-9, the apoptotic proteins associated with mitochondria,
also changed in response to coumestrol. Coumestrol also caused mitochondrial
dysfunction resulting in an increase in ROS production in PC3 and LNCaP cells.
These results suggest that coumestrol can inhibit progression of prostate cancer 
and may be a novel chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of prostate cancer via
effects mediated via the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK cell signaling
pathways. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 862-871, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Subterranean clover (Trifolium&nbsp;subterraneum) is an important pasture legume, and 
Sardinia is known as a major centre of diversification of this species. As other 
legumes, this clover produces biologically active flavonoids including the
subclass of isoflavones that are natural phytoestrogens with positive health
effects. Present sources of isoflavones for medical/nutraceutical treatments are 
red clover (Trifolium&nbsp;pratense) and soybean (Glycine&nbsp;max). This study assessed
the content and composition of flavonoids in 14 subterranean clover genotypes
from Sardinia, grown ex-situ in comparison with two red clover ecotypes, to
acquire information on the potential of the species as an alternative source of
isoflavones for possible exploitation. Twenty compounds were tentatively
identified across the two clovers after HPLC and LC/ESI-MS analyses, including
clovamide, four flavonols, and 15 isoflavones. Most compounds were present as
glucosides or glucosyl malonates. Subterranean clover extracts mainly comprised
of derivatives of the isoflavones genistein, biochanin A, and formononetin.
Compared to red clover, subterranean clover had higher content of total
isoflavones and lower concentration of total flavonols. The isoflavone
concentration in subterranean clover was higher than literature data for soybean 
or red clover. The existing genotypic variation warrants the possibility of
selecting varieties with high isoflavone concentration for nutraceutical or
pharmaceutical purposes.

Bioconversion of aglycone-formed isoflavones from glycoside-formed isoflavones by
commercial lactic acid bacteria in fermented soybean paste was evaluated.
Enterococcus faecium KCTC 13410 showed the most resistant capacity and
Lactobacillus acidophilus KCTC 3925 had a sensitive susceptibility at a high NaCl
concentration (13.2%) in fermented soybean paste. Among the 5 strains tested,
Lac. acidophilus KCTC 3925 showed the highest relative ratio of aglycone-formed
isoflavones to total isoflavones in fermented soybean paste. Production of
exopolysaccarides (EPS) by lactic acid bacteria was compared using de Man,
Rogosa, and Sharpe medium containing 1% sucrose at 37°C for 48 h. Among the 5
lactic acid bacteria, Lac. acidophilus KCTC 3925 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus KCTC
3929 were investigated to produce EPS. Based on the results concerning growing
susceptibility and conversion of aglycone-formed isoflavones/EPS production, it
is anticipated that Lac. acidophilus KCTC 3925 may be used for preparation of
Cheonggukjang, which contains relative low NaCl content.

BACKGROUND: Daidzein is an isoflavone derived from soybeans that exerts
preventive effects on bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) animals. These effects
have been correlated with increasing serum equol levels. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of antibiotic intake on equol metabolism from daidzein, 
and the corresponding levels of bone loss in OVX mice.
METHODS: Eight-week-old female ddY mice (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;42) were either ovariectomized (OVX)
or subjected to a sham operation (sham). OVX mice were then divided into six
dietary subgroups: control diet (control), 0.3&nbsp;% kanamycin diet (KN), 0.1&nbsp;%
daidzein diet (Dz), 0.1&nbsp;% daidzein and 0.0375&nbsp;% kanamycin diet (Dz+KN3.75), 0.1&nbsp;%
daidzein and 0.075&nbsp;% kanamycin diet (Dz+KN7.5), and 0.1&nbsp;% daidzein and 0.3&nbsp;%
kanamycin diet (Dz+KN30). The mice were fed their respective diets for 4&nbsp;weeks.
RESULTS: Uterine weight and femoral bone mineral density (BMD) were significantly
lower in the OVX mice compared in the sham mice. No significant differences in
uterine weight were observed among all OVX dietary subgroups. The Dz subgroup was
found to exhibit higher plasma equol and O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA)
concentrations, as well as greater femoral BMD, compared to all other OVX
subgroups. Furthermore, when compared to the Dz group, kanamycin intake decreased
plasma equol and O-DMA concentrations, as well as femoral BMD in the OVX mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that kanamycin intake inhibited the conversion
of daidzein to equol and O-DMA, blocking the preventive effects of daidzein on
bone loss in OVX mice. Therefore, the bone-protective effects of daidzein intake 
may be predominantly associated with increased plasma concentrations of either
equol or O-DMA.

SCOPE: The soy isoflavone, daidzein, is metabolized by gut microbiota to
O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) and/or equol. Producing equol is postulated as a
contributing factor for the beneficial effects of soy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized, controlled, cross-over design used an
untargeted metabolomic approach to assess the metabolic profile of different
daidzein metabolizers. Adults (n = 17) with cardiometabolic risk factors received
soy nuts or control food for 4 weeks, separated by a 2-week washout. No
significant differences were detected pre- and postintervention and between
interventions. Examination of the ability to metabolize daidzein revealed three
groups: ODMA only producers (n = 4), equol + ODMA producers (n = 8), and
nonproducers (n = 5). Analysis of the serum metabolome revealed nonproducers
could be distinguished from ODMA-only and equol + ODMA producers. Differences
between these phenotypes were related to obesity and metabolic risk (methionine, 
asparagine, and trimethylamine) with equol + ODMA producers having lower
concentrations, yet paradoxically higher pro-inflammatory cytokines. In urine,
nonproducers clustered with ODMA producers and were distinct from equol + ODMA
producers. Urinary metabolite profiles revealed significantly higher excretion of
fumarate and 2-oxoglutarate, as well as pyroglutamate, alanine, and the gut
microbial metabolite dimethylamine in equol + ODMA producers.
CONCLUSION: These results emphasize that the serum and urine metabolomes are
distinct based on the ability to metabolize isoflavones.

Pharmacological evidences have correlated a low incidence of osteoporosis, breast
cancer, cardiovascular disease, and colon cancer in Asian populations, high
consumers of soya, to the properties of soy isoflavones, more specifically to
daidzein and genistein. However, in spite of the potent biological activity,
their poor water solubility has a strong negative effect on bioavailability. In
this study, an innovative technique, nano spray drying, was used to obtain
nanoparticles loaded with a soybean dry extract while carboxymethyl cellulose was
used as the excipient. The optimization of the process conditions allowed for the
manufacturing of stable nanoparticles with a mean size of around 650 nm, a narrow
size distribution, and a high encapsulation efficiency (between 78 % and 89 %).
The presence of carboxymethyl cellulose was able to stabilize the isoflavone
extract and enhance its affinity with aqueous media, strongly increasing its
permeation through biological membranes up to 4.5-fold higher than pure soy
isoflavone extract raw material and twice its homologous minispray-dried
formulation. These results are very useful for the administration of the extract,
either topically or orally, suggesting that the isoflanones extract
nanoparticulate powder obtained by nano spray drying has great potential to
enhance extract bioavailability and could be used as an ingredient to be enclosed
in dietary supplements and nutraceutical and cosmeceutical products.

Soy milk, which is produced from whole soybeans, contains a variety of
biologically active components. Isoflavones are a class of soy-derived
phytoestrogens with beneficial effects, among which genistein (GEN) has been
previously indicated to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The present study
evaluated the effects of soy milk digestion extract (SMD) on the progression of
prostate cancer via the estrogen receptor (ER)β in human LNCaP prostate cancer
cells. To evaluate the effects of SMD (daizein, 1.988 mg/100g, glycitein,
23.537&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g and GEN, 0.685&nbsp;mg/100g) on cell proliferation, LNCaP cells were
cultured in media containing vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide), 17β‑estradiol
(E2; 2.7x10‑7&nbsp;mg/ml), GEN (2.7x10-2&nbsp;mg/ml) of SMD (total aglycon concentration,
0.79&nbsp;mg/ml), after which the cell viability was examined using an MTT assay. The 
cell viability was significantly elevated by E2 (by 45±0.18%), while it was
markedly reduced by GEN (73.2±0.03%) or SMD (74.8±0.09%). Semi‑quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to assess 
the mRNA expression levels of target genes, including ERβ, prostate
cancer‑specific antigen (PSA) and cell cycle regulators p21, Cyclin&nbsp;D1 and
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4. The expression of ERβ was almost completely
diminished by E2, whereas it was significantly elevated by SMD. In addition, the 
expression levels of PSA were considerably reduced by SMD. The expression of p21 
was significantly elevated by SMD, while it was markedly reduced by E2. Of note, 
the expression levels of Cyclin&nbsp;D1 and CDK4 were considerably elevated by E2,
while being significantly reduced by GEN and SMD. All of these results indicated 
that SMD may inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells via
regulating the expression of ERβ, PSA, p21, Cyclin&nbsp;D1 and CDK4 in an ER-dependent
manner.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Chungkookjang is a Korean representative fermented soybean
food. In this study, we investigated the effect of Korean traditional
Chungkookjang compared with placebo on body composition, dyslipidemia and risk
factors for atherosclerosis in overweight/obese subjects.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial was
conducted on 120 overweight/obese subjects, aged 19-29 years. Subjects were
randomly divided into a Chungkookjang (n=60) or a placebo (n=60) group. After 12 
weeks, the groups were crossed over for an additional 12 weeks. During the
intervention period, subjects were asked to maintain their usual diet and
activity and not to take any functional foods or dietary supplements. The
anthropometric measures, lipid profiles and atherogenic indices were determined
at baseline and at the end of each 12-week period.
RESULTS: The anthropometry measurements, percentage body fat, lean body mass,
waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio of women in the Chungkookjang group
were significantly improved compared with the placebo group. Lipid profiles and
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of women in Chungkookjang were significantly 
improved. The atherogenic indices of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 decreased
in both the placebo and the Chungkookjang group, and it also decreased below 0.55
for all the men and women in the Chungkookjang group.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these results suggest that supplementation with
Chungkookjang may improve body composition and risk factors for cardiovascular
disease in overweight and obese adults.

High-performance liquid chromatography analysis is used to examine the
distribution of isoflavones in different parts of soybean sprouts. Between the
seed leaf and hypocotyl, the ratio of isoflavones differs depending on the
aglycone type. Glycitein exists predominantly in the hypocotyl. Three compounds
isolated from 4-day-old seed coats were identified as coumestrol and its
glycosides.

Global food security remains a worldwide concern due to changing climate,
increasing population, and reduced agriculture acreages. Greenhouse cultivation
increases productivity by extending growing seasons, reducing pest infestations
and providing protection against short term drastic weather fluctuations like
frost, heat, rain, and wind. In the present study, we examined and compared the
metabolic responses of nine soybean varieties grown under field and greenhouse
conditions. Extracts were assayed by GC-FID, GC-MS, and LC-MS for the
identification of 10 primary (amino acids, organic acids, and sugars) and 10
secondary (isoflavones, fatty acid methyl esters) metabolites. Sugar molecules
(glucose, sucrose, and pinitol) and isoflavone aglycons were increased but the
isoflavones glucoside content decreased in the greenhouse cultivated soybeans.
The amino acids and organic acids varied between the varieties. The results show 
that clustering (PCA and PLS-DA) patterns of soybean metabolites were

Korea.

PURPOSE: Efficacy and comparative characteristics of fine powdered whole soybean 
curd.
METHODS: Ground dried soybean to a fine powder (700 mesh) containing bean
components in its entirety, and then produced whole soybean curd. Analysed its
nutritive components, bioactive substances, antioxidant activities and texture
compared with pressed soybean curd.
RESULTS: Compared with pressed soybean curd, the nutrients and isoflavone in
whole soybean curd were slightly decreased, but antioxidant activities, dietary
fibers and moisture content were increased. Also, the yield rate of the total
process was improved 1.9 times.
CONCLUSION: Fine powdered whole bean curd has antioxidant effects, contains
dietary fiber and possesses soft characteristics, hence has development potential
in the diet market and as food for patients.

Daidzein exerts anti-tumor activity against bladder cancer cells via inhibition
of FGFR3 pathway.

He Y, Wu X, Cao Y, Hou Y, Chen H, Wu L, Lu L, Zhu W, Gu Y.

Bladder cancer is one of the causes of cancer‑related death and has a high
mortality rate. Daidzein, a natural isoflavone compound predominantly extracted
from soybeans, has been reported to exhibit several bioactivities, including
anti-tumor. However, the effects of daidzein on bladder cancer remains
unrevealed. Here we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of daidzein
on bladder cancer using multiple in vitro cell lines and in vivo xenograft mice
studies. Our results showed that daidzein reduced cell viability in a time- and
concentration‑dependent manner. Daidzein significantly impaired colony formation,
caused G1/S cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of the bladder cancer cells. 
We also verified that daidzein efficiently suppressed RT112 cell xenograft tumor 
growth in nude mice. Mechanism studies indicated that significant down-regulation
of the FGFR3 signaling pathway was responsible for the efficacy of daidzein. The 
phosphorylation levels of FGFR3, Akt and Erk proteins were suppressed in
association with the decreasing of some apoptosis-suppressing molecules under the
daidzein treatment. Knockdown of endogenous FGFR3 impaired the activity of
daidzein against bladder cancer, which suggested that the effect of daidzein was 
mainly mediated by FGFR3 pathway. In addition, the function model of daidzein was
similar with FGFR3 antagonist PD173074 in RT112 cells. Taken together, the
results this study demonstrate that daidzein is capable of inhibiting bladder
cancer growth and might be a novel effective chemotherapeutic agent for the
application to combat bladder carcinoma.

University , Seoul, Korea.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by &gt;5%
deposition of triglycerides in hepatocytes, is often referred as a major risk
factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. We investigated the
hepatoprotective effect of whole soybean embryos containing bioactive substances 
such as isoflavones and soyasaponins. For this study, mice were randomly
allocated into four groups that were fed different diets for 10 weeks: normal
diets and high-fat and high-cholesterol diets (HD), and HD with 10% or 20%
soybean embryo powder (10SE-HD and 20SE-HD). Hepatic superoxide dismutase and
glutathione peroxidase activity of the experimental groups increased during the
period of the study (P &lt; .05). Hepatic mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor 
α, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, and Caspase 3 were decreased when
soybean embryos were increased in the mice's diets. Both of the soybean
embryo-treated groups showed significantly decreased serum and liver triglyceride
and total cholesterol. Adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α,
hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding
protein-1c, fatty acid synthase, and apolipoprotein B mRNA expressions were
decreased in the mice that were fed soybean embryos. We suggest that the regular 
supplementation of soybean embryos might be a useful treatment for preventing
NAFLD and associated complications through upregulation of adiponectin-mediated
AMPKα pathway parameters, which are implicated in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
and lipid metabolism activities.

Soy sprouts possess health benefits and is required to be cooked before
consumption. The effects of cooking on the phenolic components and antioxidant
properties of soy sprouts with different germination days were investigated. A
food-grade cultivar Prosoy with a high protein content was germinated for 1, 2,
3, 5, and 7 d and cooked till palatable for 20, 20, 5, 5, and 7 min,
respectively. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC),
condensed tannins content (CTC), individual phenolic acids, isoflavones, DPPH,
ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) of raw and cooked sprouts were measured. Cooking caused significant losses
in phenolic content and antioxidant activities, and maximum loss was on day 3 &gt; 5
&gt; 7, including TPC (32%, 23%, and 15%), TFC (50%, 44%, and 20%), CTC (73%, 47%,
and 12%), DPPH (31%, 15%, and 5%), FRAP (34%, 25%, and 1%), and ORAC (34%, 22%,
32%), respectively. Cooking caused significant losses in most individual phenolic
acid, benzoic group, cinnamic group, total phenolic composition, individual
isoflavones, and total isoflavones. The losses of phenolic acids such as gallic, 
protocatechuic, hydroxybenzoic, syringic, chlorogenic, or sinapic acids during
cooking were not compensated by the increases in trihydroxybenzoic, vanillic or
coumaric acids on certain days of germination. Cooking caused minimal changes in 
phenolic acid composition of day 1 and 2 sprouts compared to 3, 5, and 7 d
sprouts.

An extracellular β-glucosidase produced by Aspergillus terreus was identified,
purified, characterized and was tested for the hydrolysis of soybean isoflavone. 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with tandem
time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) revealed the
protein to be a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 3 with an apparent
molecular mass of about 120 kDa. The purified β-glucosidase showed optimal
activity at pH 5.0 and 65 °C and was very stable at 50 °C. Moreover, the enzyme
exhibited good stability over pH 3.0-8.0 and possessed high tolerance towards
pepsin and trypsin. The kinetic parameters Km (apparent Michaelis-Menten
constant) and Vmax (maximal reaction velocity) for
p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) were 1.73 mmol/L and 42.37 U/mg,
respectively. The Km and Vmax for cellobiose were 4.11 mmol/L and 5.7 U/mg,
respectively. The enzyme efficiently converted isoflavone glycosides to
aglycones, with a hydrolysis rate of 95.8% for daidzin, 86.7% for genistin, and
72.1% for glycitin. Meanwhile, the productivities were 1.14 mmol/(L·h) for
daidzein, 0.72 mmol/(L·h) for genistein, and 0.19 mmol/(L·h) for glycitein. This 
is the first report on the application of A. terreus β-glucosidase for converting
isoflavone glycosides to their aglycones in soybean products.

Urine and serum biomonitoring was used to measure internal exposure to selected
dietary estrogens in a cohort of 30 pregnant women. Exposure was measured over a 
period comprising one-half day in the field (6&nbsp;h) and one day in a clinic (24&nbsp;h).
Biomonitoring of the dietary phytoestrogens genistein (GEN), daidzein (DDZ) and
equol (EQ), as well as the mycoestrogen, zearalenone (ZEN) and its congeners, was
conducted using UPLC-MS/MS. Biomonitoring revealed evidence of internal exposure 
to naturally occurring dietary estrogens during pregnancy. Urinary concentrations
of total GEN, DDZ and EQ were similar to levels reported for general adult
U.S.POPULATION: Measurable concentrations of total (parent and metabolites) GEN, 
DDZ and EQ were present in 240, 207 and 2 of 270 serum samples, respectively. Six
out of 30 subjects had measurable concentrations of unconjugated GEN and/or DDZ
in serum between 0.6 and 7.1&nbsp;nM. Urine to serum total isoflavone ratios for GEN, 
DDZ and EQ were 13, 47, and 180, respectively. ZEN and its reductive metabolite, 
α-zearalenol (α-ZEL), were present in pregnant women (11 out of 30 subjects) as
conjugates at levels near the limit of quantification. The average total urinary 
concentration was 0.10&nbsp;μg/L for ZEN and 0.11&nbsp;μg/L for α-ZEL.

In the present study, we established an in&nbsp;vitro model of hypoxic-ischemia via
exposing primary neurons of newborn rats to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and 
observing the effects of genistein, a soybean isoflavone, on hypoxic-ischemic
neuron viability, apoptosis, voltage-activated potassium (Kv) and sodium (Nav)
currents, and glutamate receptor subunits. The results indicated that OGD
exposure reduced the viability and increased the apoptosis of brain neurons.
Meanwhile, OGD exposure caused changes in the current-voltage curves and current 
amplitude values of voltage-activated potassium and sodium currents; OGD exposure
also decreased GluR2 expression and increased NR2 expression. However, genistein 
at least partially reversed the effects caused by OGD. The results suggest that
hypoxic-ischemia-caused neuronal apoptosis/death is related to an increase in
K(+) efflux, a decrease in Na(+) influx, a down-regulation of GluR2, and an
up-regulation of NR2. Genistein may exert some neuroprotective effects via the
modulation of Kv and Nav currents and the glutamate signal pathway, mediated by
GluR2 and NR2.

Diet is an important variable in toxicology. There are mixed reports on the
impact of soy components on energy utilization, fat deposition, and reproductive 
parameters. Three generations of CD-1 mice were fed irradiated natural ingredient
diets with varying levels of soy (NIH-41, 5K96, or 5008/5001), purified
irradiated AIN-93 diet, or the AIN-93 formulation modified with ethanol-washed
soy protein concentrate (SPC) or SPC with isoflavones (SPC-IF). NIH-41 was the
control for pairwise comparisons. Minimal differences were observed among natural
ingredient diet groups. F0 males fed AIN-93, SPC, and SPC-IF diets had elevated
glucose levels and lower insulin levels compared with the NIH-41 group. In both
sexes of the F1 and F2 generations, the SPC and SPC-IF groups had lower body
weight gains than the NIH-41 controls and the AIN-93 group had an increased
percent body fat at postnatal day 21. AIN-93 F1 pups had higher baseline glucose 
than NIH-41 controls, but diet did not significantly affect breeding performance 
or responses to glucose or uterotrophic challenges. Reduced testes weight and
sperm in the AIN-93 group may be related to low thiamine levels. Our observations
underline the importance of careful selection, manufacturing procedures, and
nutritional characterization of diets used in toxicological studies.

Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer worldwide and the most
frequent among women, being the fifth cause of death from neoplastic disease.
Since this is an oxidative-stress related neoplasia, it is largely preventable. A
dietary isoflavone abundant in soybean - daidzein - is currently being
investigated owing to its chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic properties
towards the human MDA-MB-231 (metastatic, estrogen-unresponsive) and MCF-7
(estrogen-responsive) breast cancer cell lines. Biological assays for evaluation 
of antitumour and anti-invasive activities were combined with state-of-the-art
vibrational microspectroscopy techniques. At 50 and 100 μM concentrations and 48 
h incubation time, daidzein was found to induce a marked decrease in cell
viability (ca. 50%) for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (respectively ca. 50% and 42%)
and 40% inhibition of cell migration. MicroRaman analysis of fixed cells upon
exposure to this isoflavone unveiled its metabolic impact on both cell lines.
Multivariate data analysis (unsupervised PCA) led to a clear discrimination
between the control and DAID-exposed cells, with distinctive effects on their
biochemical profile, particularly regarding DNA, lipids and protein components,
in a cell-dependent way. This is the first reported study on the impact of
dietary antioxidants on cancer cells by microRaman techniques.

(1)Department of Vascular Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of soy or isoflavones 
on blood homocysteine levels via a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (up to 16
December 2015) were used for the literature review. Only randomised controlled
trials were included. The primary outcome was the standard mean difference (SMD) 
of blood homocysteine levels between the experimental and control groups.
RESULTS: Nineteen randomised controlled studies were included for qualitative
analysis. Eighteen studies were included in the data synthesis. Soy or
isoflavones were found to have no effect on homocysteine levels, with a SMD of
-0.21 (95% confidence interval = -0.43 to 0.00, I2 =67.7%, random effect model). 
No publication bias was found among those studies (P = 0.296 for Egger's test,
and P = 0.198 for Begg's test).
CONCLUSIONS: Soy or isoflavones were not found to be associated with a reduction 
in homocysteine levels. Further studies might still be needed in carefully
selected populations.

Soybeans are widely used both for human nutrition and animal feed, since they are
an important source of protein, and they also provide components such as
phytosterols, isoflavones, and amino acids. In this study, were determined the
concentrations of the amino acids lysine, histidine, arginine, asparagine,
glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine,
phenylalanine present in 14 samples of conventional soybeans and 6 transgenic,
cultivated in two cities of the state of Paraná, Londrina and Ponta Grossa. The
results were tabulated and presented to a self-organising map for segmentation
according planting regions and conventional or transgenic varieties. A network
with 7000 training epochs and a 10&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 topology was used, and it proved
appropriate in the segmentation of the samples using the data analysed. The
weight maps provided by the network, showed that all the amino acids were
important in targeting the samples, especially isoleucine. Three clusters were
formed, one with only Ponta Grossa samples (including transgenic (PGT) and common
(PGC)), a second group with Londrina transgenic (LT) samples and the third with
Londrina common (LC) samples.

Estrogenic isoflavones were found, in the 1940s, to disrupt ewe reproduction and 
were identified in soy-consumers' urine in 1982. This led to controversy about
their safety, often supported by current Asian diet measurements, but not by
historical data. Traditional Asian recipes of soy were tested while assaying soy 
glycosilated isoflavones. As these compounds are water-soluble, their
concentration is reduced by soaking. Pre-cooking or simmering time-dependently
reduces the isoflavone:protein ratio in Tofu. Cooking soy-juice for 15 or 60min
decreases the isoflavone:protein ratios in Tofu from 6.90 to 3.57 and 1.80,
respectively (p&lt;0.001). Traditional Tempeh contains only 18.07% of the original
soybean isoflavones (p&lt;0.001). Soy-juice isoflavones were reduced by
ultra-filtration (6.54 vs 1.24 isoflavone:protein; p&lt;0.001). Soy-protein and
isoflavones are dissociated by water rinsing and prolonged cooking, but these
have no equivalent in modern processes. As regards human health, a precise
definition of the safety level of isoflavone intake requires additional studies.

In this study the effects of commercial bovine and soybean milks and their
bioactive compounds, namely genistein, daidzein and equol, on the inflammatory
responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of human intestinal
Caco-2 cells were examined, in terms of nitric oxide (NO) release and inducible
nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) expression. Both milks and their bioactive
compounds significantly inhibited, dose-dependently, the expression of iNOS mRNA 
and protein, resulting in a decreased NO production. The NF-κB activation in
LPS-stimulated intestinal cells was also examined. In all cases we observed that 
cell pre-treatment before LPS activation inhibited the IkB phosphorylation.
Accordingly, quantification of bioactive compounds by solid phase microextraction
coupled with liquid chromatography has shown that they were absorbed, metabolized
and released by Caco-2 cells in culture media. In conclusion, we demonstrated
that milks and compounds tested are able to reduce LPS-induced inflammatory
responses from intestinal cells, interfering with NF-kB dependent molecular
mechanisms.

Equol is a metabolite of the soya isoflavone (ISO) daidzein that is produced by
intestinal microbiota. Equol has greater oestrogenic activity compared with other
ISO, and it prevents bone loss in postmenopausal women. Resistant starch (RS),
which has a prebiotic activity and is a dietary fibre, was reported to promote
equol production. Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is reported to directly
regulate bone health by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels and T-lymphocytes
in bone. The present study evaluated the combined effects of diet supplemented
with ISO and RS on intestinal microbiota, equol production, bone mineral density 
(BMD) and inflammatory gene expression in the bone marrow of ovariectomised (OVX)
mice. Female ddY strain mice, aged 8 weeks, were either sham-operated (Sham, n 7)
or OVX. OVX mice were randomly divided into the following four groups (seven per 
group): OVX control (OVX); OVX fed 0·05 % ISO diet (OVX+ISO); OVX fed 9 % RS diet
(OVX+RS); and OVX fed 0·05 % ISO- and 9 % RS diet (OVX+ISO+RS). After 6 weeks,
treatment with the combination of ISO and RS increased equol production,
prevented the OVX-induced decline in trabecular BMD in the distal femur by
modulating the enteric environment and altered OVX-induced inflammation-related
gene expression in the bone marrow. However, there were no significant
differences in bone parameters between the ISO+RS and ISO-alone groups in OVX
mice. Our findings suggest that the combination of ISO and RS might alter
intestinal microbiota and immune status in the bone marrow, resulting in
attenuated bone resorption in OVX mice.

We examined the cooperative effects of isoflavones and cello-oligosaccharides on 
daidzein metabolism and bone fragility in ovariectomized mice.
Cello-oligosaccharides increased urinary equol and decreased
O-desmethylangolensin. A combination of isoflavones and cello-oligosaccharides
attenuated decreases in bone breaking force and stiffness caused by ovariectomy. 
Combination treatment with isofalvones and cello-oligosaccharides increases
urinary equol/O-desmethylangolensin production ratio and prevents
ovariectomy-induced abnormalities in bone strength.

KEY MESSAGE: Utilizing an innovative GWAS in CSLRP, 44 QTL 199 alleles with
72.2&nbsp;% contribution to SIFC variation were detected and organized into a
QTL-allele matrix for cross design and gene annotation. The seed isoflavone
content (SIFC) of soybeans is of great importance to health care. The Chinese
soybean landrace population (CSLRP) as a genetic reservoir was studied for its
whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL) system of the SIFC using an innovative
restricted two-stage multi-locus genome-wide association study procedure
(RTM-GWAS). A sample of 366 landraces was tested under four environments and
sequenced using RAD-seq (restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing) technique to
obtain 116,769 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) then organized into 29,119 
SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) for GWAS. The detected 44 QTL 199
alleles on 16 chromosomes (explaining 72.2&nbsp;% of the total phenotypic variation)
with the allele effects (92 positive and 107 negative) of the CSLRP were
organized into a QTL-allele matrix showing the SIFC population genetic structure.
Additional differentiation among eco-regions due to the SIFC in addition to that 
of genome-wide markers was found. All accessions comprised both positive and
negative alleles, implying a great potential for recombination within the
population. The optimal crosses were predicted from the matrices, showing
transgressive potentials in the CSLRP. From the detected QTL system, 55 candidate
genes related to 11 biological processes were χ (2)-tested as an SIFC candidate
gene system. The present study explored the genome-wide SIFC QTL/gene system with
the innovative RTM-GWAS and found the potentials of the QTL-allele matrix in
optimal cross design and population genetic and genomic studies, which may have
provided a solution to match the breeding by design strategy at both QTL and gene
levels in breeding programs.

Over the past decade, our research group has characterized and used a mouse model
to demonstrate that "nutritional programming" of bone development occurs when
mice receive soy isoflavones (ISO) during the first days of life. Nutritional
programming of bone development can be defined as the ability for diet during
early life to set a trajectory for better or compromised bone health at
adulthood. We have shown that CD-1 mice exposed to soy ISO during early neonatal 
life have higher bone mineral density (BMD) and greater trabecular
inter-connectivity in long bones and lumbar spine at young adulthood. These
skeletal sites also withstand greater forces before fracture. Because the
chemical structure of ISO resembles that of 17-β-estradiol and can bind to
estrogen receptors in reproductive tissues, it was prudent to expand analyses to 
include measures of reproductive health. This review highlights aspects of our
studies in CD-1 mice to understand the early life programming effects of soy ISO 
on bone and reproductive health. Preclinical mouse models can provide useful data
to help develop and guide the design of studies in human cohorts, which may,
depending on findings and considerations of safety, lead to dietary interventions
that optimize bone health.

Ultra-High Pressure Homogenization (100-300MPa) has great potential for
technological, microbiological and nutritional aspects of fluid processing. Its
effect on the oxidative stability and interfacial properties of oil-in-water
emulsions prepared with 4% (w/v) of soy protein isolate and soybean oil (10 and
20%, v/v) were studied and compared to emulsions treated by conventional
homogenization (15MPa). Emulsions were characterized by particle size,
emulsifying activity index, surface protein concentration at the interface and by
transmission electron microscopy. Primary and secondary lipid oxidation products 
were evaluated in emulsions upon storage. Emulsions with 20% oil treated at 100
and 200MPa exhibited the most oxidative stability due to higher amount of oil and
protein surface load at the interface. This manuscript addresses the improvement 
in oxidative stability in emulsions treated by UHPH when compared to conventional
emulsions.

Dietary supplementation of soy stachyose or genistein is known to be of
hepatoprotective health interest. This study showed that co-administration of
genistein and stachyose caused stronger inhibition on abnormal weight gain and
liver fat accumulation by decreasing fatty acid synthetase expression and
balancing disorderly lipid metabolism than that of genistein or stachyose alone
in high-fructose (HF) diet-fed mice. Furthermore, the production of malonaldehyde
and carbonyl derivatives of proteins was also more effectively inhibited by
co-treatment of genistein and stachyose, and thereby glutathione peroxidase and
superoxide dismutase activities were elevated in HF-fed mice. Moreover, genistein
in combination with stachyose was more effective to reduce the impact of HF on
the serum markers of liver damage by inhibiting inflammatory cytokine release
than stachyose or genistein alone in mice. The potential mechanism was that
stachyose enhanced absorption of genistein in HF-fed mice by oral supplementation
of genistein together with stachyose. These findings indicate that co-ingestion
of stachyose and genistein may serve as a novel strategy for hepatic protection.

The pandemic tendency of obesity and its strong association with serious
co-morbidities have elicited interest in the underlying mechanisms of these
pathologies. Lipid homeostasis, closely involved in obesity, has been reported to
be regulated by multiple pathways. mTORC1 is emerging as a critical regulator of 
lipid metabolism. Here, we describe that the consumption of soy isoflavones, with
a structural similarity to that of estradiol, could mitigate obesity through an
AKT/mTORC1 pathway. Fed with soy isoflavones, the diet-induced obesity (DIO) male
rats exhibited decreased body weight, accompanied with suppressed lipogenesis and
adipogenesis, as well as enhanced lipolysis and β‑oxidation. The phosphorylation 
of AKT and S6 were decreased after soy isoflavone treatment in vivo and in vitro,
suggesting an inhibition effect of soy isoflavones on mTORC1 activity. Our study 
reveals a potential mechanism of soy isoflavones regulating lipid homeostasis,
which will be important for obesity treatment.

The reduced risk of breast cancer observed in Asia has been linked with diets
rich in soy foods, and observational studies suggest that regular soy food intake
is related to lower circulating levels of some inflammatory markers which have
been implicated in breast cancer risk. However, short-term intervention studies
with soy-based diets in small numbers of women have shown few significant changes
in adipocytokine levels. This 8-wk dietary intervention study in 57 healthy
postmenopausal women investigated whether soy food supplementation (50&nbsp;mg
isoflavones or 15&nbsp;g soy protein in the form of tofu) or a very low-fat diet
(11.3% of total energy), similar to the traditional Asian diet, is associated
with beneficial effects on serum levels of the following adipocytokines: TNF-α,
IL-6, adiponectin, and resistin. We found no statistically significant changes in
the levels of these adipocytokines in association with the very low-fat diet or
soy supplementation. Only the change in TNF-α levels between the very low-fat and
control diet groups had borderline statistical significance. We conclude that
ingestion of a very low-fat diet or a soy food supplemented diet for 8&nbsp;wk does
not significantly alter important circulating adipocytokines.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic autoimmune inflammatory
disease. Typical pathological findings of RA include persistent synovitis and
bone degradation in the peripheral joints. Equol, a metabolite of the major
soybean isoflavone daidzein, shows superior bioactivity than other isoflavones.
We investigated the effects of equol administration on inflammatory response and 
bone erosion in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The severity of
arthritis symptoms was significantly low in the equol-administered CIA mice. In
addition, equol administration improved the CIA-induced bone mineral density
decline. In the inflamed area of CIA mice, equol administration suppressed the
expression of interleukin-6 and its receptor. Furthermore, equol reduced the
expression of genes associated with bone formation inhibition, osteoclast and
immature osteoblast specificity and cartilage destruction. These results suggest 
that equol suppresses RA development and RA-induced bone erosion by regulating
inflammation and bone metabolism.

In this study, we compared the effects of two diets containing different
isoflavone concentrations on the isoflavone transfer from feed into milk and on
the rumen microbiota in lactating dairy cows. The on-farm experiment was
conducted on twelve lactating Czech Fleckvieh x Holstein cows divided into two
groups, each with similar mean milk yield. Twice daily, cows were individually
fed a diet based on maize silage, meadow hay and supplemental mixture. Control
group (CTRL) received the basal diet while the experimental group (EXP) received 
the basal diet supplemented with 40% soybean isoflavone extract. The average
daily isoflavone intake in the EXP group (16 g/day) was twice as high as that in 
the CTRL group (8.4 g/day, P&lt;0.001). Total isoflavone concentrations in milk from
the CTRL and EXP groups were 96.89 and 276.07 μg/L, respectively (P&lt;0.001). Equol
concentrations in milk increased from 77.78 μg/L in the CTRL group to 186.30 μg/L
in the EXP group (P&lt;0.001). The V3-4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was used 
for metagenomic analysis of the rumen microbiome. The experimental cows exhibited
fewer OTUs at a distance level of 0.03 compared to control cows (P&lt;0.05) and
reduced microbial richness compared to control cows based on the calculated
Inverse Simpson and Shannon indices. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis
showed that the major contributor to separation between the experimental and
control groups were changes in the representation of bacteria belonging to the
phyla Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes.
Surprisingly, a statistically significant positive correlation was found only
between isoflavones and the phyla Burkholderiales (r = 0.65, P&lt;0.05) and
unclassified Betaproteobacteria (r = 0.58, P&lt;0.05). Previous mouse and human
studies of isoflavone effects on the composition of gastrointestinal microbial
populations generally report similar findings.

MAIN CONCLUSION: The interaction between neighboring weed-induced far-red
enriched light and thiamethoxam can significantly alter soybean seedling
morphology, nodulation, isoflavone levels, UV-absorbing phenolics, and carbon and
nitrogen content. Neonicotinoid insecticides that are widely used on major crop
plants can enhance plant growth and yield. Although the underlying mechanism of
this enhanced growth and yield is not clear, recent studies suggest that
neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam (TMX) may exert their effects at least in
part via signals that involve salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). In the 
current research, effects of TMX on morphological and physiological responses of 
soybean have been compared under far-red-depleted (FR-D) and far-red-enriched
(FR-E) light reflected by neighboring weeds. TMX significantly enhanced shoot and
root growth but did not prevent stem elongation under FR-E light. Also, TMX did
not prevent reductions in shoot carbon content and shoot carbon to nitrogen ratio
under FR-E light. Despite similarities between these TMX effects in soybean and
those known for SA and JA in other plant species, TMX significantly enhanced
root-nodule numbers per plant and levels of root isoflavones malonyl-daidzin and 
malonyl-genistin under FR-E light only. These results suggest that the combined
effect of FR-E light and TMX triggers a mechanism that operates concomitantly to 
enhance root isoflavones and nodulation in soybean.

Effects of Ca(2+) on yield and nutritional qualities of soybean sprout were
investigated. Ca-treated sprouts had higher yield than water-treated ones.
Metabolism of selected storage materials and bioactive substances in soybean
sprouts was strengthened by Ca(2+). The phytic acid and saponin content of
Ca-treated soybean sprouts were lower than those of control. Supplemental Ca(2+) 
increased content of gamma-aminobutyric acid, isoflavones, phenolics, and
vitamins, respectively. These findings indicate that supplemental Ca(2+) can
increase soybean sprout yield and improve its nutritional qualities. The
comparative transcriptome and proteomics between water-treated and Ca-treated
soybean sprouts were studied. As consequence 1912 genes and 460 proteins were up-
or down-regulated after 4days of Ca(2+) treatment. The functional classification 
of these differentially expressed genes and proteins indicated their connection
with primary/secondary metabolic pathways, ion transport, signal transduction,
and transcriptional regulation. The results obtained here will enable to
understand how changes in yield and nutritional quality are regulated by extra
Ca(2+) in soybean sprouts.BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, a total of 1912
genes and 460 proteins involved in the growth, storage material decomposition,
and bioactive substance synthesis in soybean sprouts after treated with Ca(2+)
were identified. This is the first report of a comprehensive transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis of soybean sprout in response to supplemental Ca(2+).

Consumption of soy infant formula represents a unique exposure scenario in which 
developing children ingest a mixture of endocrine-active isoflavones along with a
substantial portion of daily nutrition. Genistein and daidzein were administered 
as glucoside conjugates to neonatal rhesus monkeys in a fortified commercial soy 
formula at 5, 35, and 70 days after birth. A single gavage dosing with 10&nbsp;mg/kg
bw genistein and 6&nbsp;mg/kg bw daidzein was chosen to represent the upper range of
typical daily consumption and to facilitate complete pharmacokinetic measurements
for aglycone and total isoflavones and equol. Adult monkeys were also gavaged
with the same formula solution at 2.8 and 1.6&nbsp;mg/kg bw genistein and daidzein,
respectively, and by IV injection with isoflavone aglycones (5.2 and 3.2&nbsp;mg/kg
bw, respectively) to determine absolute bioavailability. Significant differences 
in internal exposure were observed between neonatal and adult monkeys, with
higher values for dose-adjusted AUC and Cmax of the active aglycone isoflavones
in neonates. The magnitude and frequency of equol production by the gut
microbiome were also significantly greater in adults. These findings are
consistent with immaturity of metabolic and/or physiological systems in
developing non-human primates that reduces total clearance of soy isoflavones
from the body.

A β-glucosidase Bgl1A variant (A24S/F297Y) with improved ethanol tolerance was
obtained by semi-rational engineering. At 30-40°C, IC50 values (the amount
required for inhibiting 50% enzyme activity) of the variant for ethanol were
17-30% (v/v), 1.4- to 2.4-fold of Bgl1A. When incubating in 15% (v/v) ethanol at 
30°C, the half-life of A24S/F297Y was 13min; whereas Bgl1A lost all enzyme
activity within 5min. A24S/F297Y was more stable at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5, and
more than 50% of the original activity remained after incubation at 30°C for 10h.
At 35°C and pH 7.5, the half-life of A24S/F297Y was 80min, 4.3 times longer than 
that of Bgl1A. When converting isoflavone glycosides to aglycones using
A24S/F297Y as catalyst, the hydrolysis rates were 99% for daidzin and 98% for
genistin. The concentrations of daidzein and genistein rapidly increased by
7.02mM and 4.35mM within 10min, respectively. These results showed that
A24S/F297Y was a promising candidate for the enzymatic hydrolysis of soybean
isoflavone glycosides.

The profiles of isoflavone and fatty acids constitute important quality traits in
soybean seeds, for making soy-based functional food products, due to their
important contributions to the flavor and nutritional value of these products. In
general, the composition of these constituents in raw soybeans is affected by
cultivation factors, such as sunlight; however, the relationship of the
isoflavone and fatty acid profiles with cultivation factors is not well
understood. This study evaluated the isoflavone and fatty acid profiles in
soybeans grown under a maize-soybean relay strip intercropping system with
different row spacings, and with changes in the photosynthetic active radiation
(PAR) transmittance. The effects of PAR on the isoflavone and fatty acid contents
were found to be quadratic. Appropriate intercropping shading may reduce the
bitterness of soybeans caused by soy aglycone and could improve their fatty acid 
composition.

There is a special role for estrogens in preventing and curing cardiovascular
disease in women. Soy isoflavone (SI), a soy-derived phytoestrogen, has similar
chemical structure to endogenous estrogen-estradiol. We investigate to elucidate 
the protective mechanism of SI on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. 
Female SD rats underwent bilateral ovariectomy. One week later, rats were
randomly divided into several groups, sham ovariectomy (control group),
ovariectomy with MI/R, or ovariectomy with sham MI/R. Other ovariectomy rats were
given different doses of SI or 17β-estradiol (E2). Four weeks later, they were
exposed to 30 minutes of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 6 or 24 hours
of reperfusion. SI administration significantly reduced myocardial infarct size
and improved left ventricle function and restored endothelium-dependent
relaxation function of thoracic aortas after MI/R in ovariectomized rats. SI also
decreased serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity, reduced
plasma malonaldehyde, and attenuated oxidative stress in the myocardium.
Meanwhile, SI increased phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signal pathway. SI failed to decrease infarct size
of hearts with I/R in ovariectomized rats if PI3K was inhibited. Overall, these
results indicated that SI protects myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in
ovariectomized rats through increasing PI3K/Akt/eNOS signal pathway and
decreasing oxidative stress.

Due to the association of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with breast cancer
risk, estrogenically active soy isoflavones are considered as an HRT alternative 
to alleviate menopausal symptoms. However, several recent reports challenged the 
health benefits of soy isoflavones and associated them with breast cancer
promotion. While glyconic isoflavones are the major constituents of soybean
seeds, due to their low cell permeability, they are considered to be biologically
inactive. The glyconic isoflavones may exert their effects on membrane-bound
estrogen receptors or could be converted to aglycones by extracellular
β-glucosidases. Therefore, we hypothesized that despite their low cell
permeability, soybean cultivars with high glyconic isoflavones may promote breast
cancer cell growth. To test this, composition and estrogenic activity of
isoflavones from 54 commercial soybean cultivars were determined. Soybean seeds
produced in identical climate and growth conditions were used to minimize the
effects of extraneous factors on isoflavone profile and concentrations. The
glyconic daidzin concentration negatively correlated with genistin and with other
aglycones. Relative to control, isoflavone extracts from 51 cultivars were
estrogenic and promoted the growth of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast
cancer cell line MCF-7 from 1.14 to 4.59 folds and other three cultivars slightly
reduced the growth. Among these, extracts from three cultivars were highly
estrogenic and promoted MCF-7 cell growth by 2.59-4.64 folds (P&lt;0.005). Among six
isoflavones, daidzin was positively associated with MCF-7 cell growth (P&lt;0.005, r
= 0.13966), whereas the negative correlation between genistin and MCF-7 cell
growth was nearly significant (P≤0.0562, r = -0.026141). Furthermore, in drug
interaction studies daidzin-rich isoflavone extracts antagonized tamoxifen, an ER
inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that the glyconic daidzin-rich soy
isoflavone extracts may exert estrogenic effects and promote ER+ breast cancer
growth.
